<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—cosmic detachment vs. greenhouse intimacy—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (scraping dust, monitoring chrysalis). The final renunciation of institute metrics for humble observation carries visible cost: “She ignored them.” Flawed passivity (waiting on a chrysalis) complicates her agency yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust density and fungal growth tighten the stake until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes in the symposium slide of “dust-caked ferns,” cost legible in professional ridicule. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is no backdrop; broken glass and silt-clogged drains constrain every move. Butterfly dust on the spectrometer slide becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (humidity-fogged lenses, moth-eaten frond) filters through Elara’s astrophysicist bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can rigorous metrics map organic decay?—tightens when dust patterns resist prediction. One deepening: the monarch’s spiral forces her to accept unpredictability. Cost is the institute’s scoffing; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of gradual, messy change emerges from dust spirals and mold rings, never sermonized. Final image of symposium slides reweights earlier cosmic detachment into humble attentiveness. Subtext in her muttered “Decay isn’t an event—it’s a language” carries earned irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: neutron-star vocabulary (“dying pulsar,” “accretion disks”) grafted onto greenhouse debris. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during chrysalis emergence, longer ruminative sentences amid decay. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers observation and metaphor without clutter. “Moth-eaten fern’s frond, its edges curled like the waveform of a dying pulsar” fuses disciplines cleanly. No loops or register drift; minor hedge “she’d begun” could trim but doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: astrophysics as lens for post-flood ecology. Butterfly dust as stellar debris feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky symposium pivot lands because groundwork (dust spectra, chrysalis spiral) is laid early. No derivative echoes.</comment>
