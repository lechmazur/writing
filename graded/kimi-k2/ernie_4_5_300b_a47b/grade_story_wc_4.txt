<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is textured—her perceptively calm gaze, the meditative pencil motion—but the “collective healing” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is forced into a costly choice. The final “enough” lands as earned stasis, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of arcs (photos, vines, sketches) deepens until the dove-feather/“enough” reconfigures meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost; no orientation debt. One transition (walk home) is brief and contiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the arcs motif; the map case and dove feather act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; scent and rust textures guide attention without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting pain into art—tightens once when Lila realizes the masterpiece may already exist; this reweights her goal with a visible renunciation (no new photograph needed). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-through-decay emerges organically from arcs motif and reclaimed factory; no explicit moralizing. Final “enough” offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity is present but slightly muted by gentle tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—dove-gray palette, tactile leather, scent of lavender—remains consistent. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; figurative language is patterned and cohesive. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Occasional elevated diction (“transmute,” “conceptual repricing”) fits reflective mode and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar ruin-reclamation trope is refreshed through the arcs motif and the puzzle-archivist lens. Specific sensory detail and the grandmother’s photographic legacy create freshness. Risk is moderate; synthesis feels inevitable but not startling.</comment>
