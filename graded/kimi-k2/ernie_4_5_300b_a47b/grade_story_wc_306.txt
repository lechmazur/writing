<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—salt-stained stone, the shard’s hum—but the shift from hired skeptic to vulnerable guide is asserted more than dramatized; Mira’s pressure is present yet muted, so the cost feels moderate rather than crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s final chime-removal crystallizes a stance with felt cost, and the causal lens holds; the lighthouse sequence is one continuous scene, anchored early, with no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s damp wood, wind-rattled windows, and salt air are vivid and selective; the cloak itself functions as micro-setting that constrains perception, charging the final image when Elias folds it away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira’s need to parse guilt versus ghost—is signaled early; escalation occurs through the cloak’s sensory filter and the progressive unhooking of chimes, each narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of doubt as clarifying filter emerges organically from the chime sequence and cloak experiment; the final cedar-oak duet offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the widow’s grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical yet precise—“salt-stained stone cool against his palms,” “sincerely insincere” handled without wink; POV stays locked to Elias, perceptual signature consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional figurative flourishes (“ghost of laughter”) are earned and never clog momentum; no loops or register drift detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Premise of a “conscience for hire” wielding a doubt-inducing cloak feels fresh; the wind-chime cipher and hollow mirror create a specific synthesis rather than trope recycling, though the emotional arc hews to familiar grief-work.</comment>
