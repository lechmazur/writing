<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—methodical mapper vs. self-lacerating seeker—is embodied in micro-choices (touching brick, kneeling to play). The final “Begin” is earned by prior beats: she re-maps her heart, pays the cost of raw exposure, and forecloses the medicated numbness. Flawed competence balanced with struggle; no safety-hedging. One slip: “raw solace” edges therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new chalk “Begin” crystallizes reconfigured options after Mara’s accordion-breath re-mapping. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each graffiti fragment layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible: she walks away unmedicated, bearing the river’s unfiltered hum. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s damp rust, ivy-choked arches, and sluggish tributary are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain choices (ivy preserves graffiti, drainpipe leads to water). The accordion’s warm bellows functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. One minor redundancy: “disused railway station smelled of damp earth and rust” could trim “damp.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early; pressure tightens when graffiti forces Mara to translate external maps into internal ones. The accordion chord and heart-map constitute one meaningful deepening that forecloses medicated detachment. Cost is felt: raw exposure without chemical buffer. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (new chalk) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrender-as-flow emerges from specific graffiti fragments and Mara’s bodily acts; no direct statement until the final word “Begin,” which reweights all prior material. Subtext in ivy’s “green archive” and the river’s refusal to stay still. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether she can sustain the current.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sensory hierarchy filtered through chronicler’s priorities (textures of brick, silt, tape). Rhythm modulates—longer lyrical sentences under ivy, clipped fragments during discovery. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. “Raw solace” is the lone register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or choice. Metaphors (“ivy…like a thousand green fingers”) are purposeful and paid off. No loops or scaffold beyond one near-paraphrase of “mapping rivers” idea. Clean grammar; pronoun references tight. Final paragraph breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: graffiti-as-emotional-cartography transforms familiar redemption arc. Risk-taking in treating map references as emotional rather than literal pays off. Specificity of patched accordion and Thames tributary grounds the concept. Avoids stock tropes; “Begin” feels inevitable yet non-generic.</comment>
