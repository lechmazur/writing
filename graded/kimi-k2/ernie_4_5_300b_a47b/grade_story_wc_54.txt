<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila’s curiosity and “functional creativity” are repeatedly asserted but only briefly embodied when she reroutes conduits; the internal contradiction between nostalgia and repurposing is sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—leaving to refine the equation—carries mild poise yet lacks a felt cost on the page. Character voice is coherent but leans on stock phrases (“stoic wonder,” “restlessness mirrored decay”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the luminous equation projects hope while the terminal dims, reconfiguring meaning without tidy resolution. Causal chain is clear—find sextant → reroute systems → equation appears—yet the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One minor ellipsis: how rerouting abandoned conduits yields immediate light is elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Terminal’s dust, shattered glass, and moonlit crater are vivid and selective, filtering through Lila’s engineering gaze. The sextant’s etched constellations charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment constrains choice only loosely—access to conduits is assumed rather than struggled for.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove broken systems can birth hope—is signaled early and tightened when the equation appears. Escalation is a single deepening: discovery of sextant → redirect flows → equation projected. Cost is abstract (future uncertainty) rather than tangible. Agency is hers, yet pressure feels moderate; no irreversible forfeiture shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of repurposing decay into possibility emerges through concrete action, not sermon. The carnival’s absence and the glowing equation create understated resonance. Final image avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers. One near-theme echo—“future built not on nostalgia”—is brief and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lila’s perceptual filter; diction skews technical yet lyrical (“luminous equation,” “redirected flows”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments during discovery. No POV leakage. Voice feels individual, though occasional elevated phrasing edges toward editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with strong verbs and sensory specificity. One paraphrase loop—“terminal’s decay mirrored her restlessness” / “world that had forgotten how to dream”—dulls momentum slightly. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final paragraph’s cadence rises to a quiet crescendo without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned spaceport as crucible for functional resurrection via celestial relic. Avoids clichés of ghostly revival; instead offers engineering rebirth. Specificity of sextant’s obsolete constellations and redirected infrastructure feels inevitable. Minor risk in abstract cost, but payoff remains legible.</comment>
