<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elinor’s interiority is concrete—calloused hands, mossy delight—but the shift from skeptic to believer happens in a single beat (“until now”) without embodied contradiction. The final resolve is credible yet feels slightly tidy; no lingering flaw complicates her new purpose. Micro-choices (nudging the speck, building monuments) reveal hierarchy of values, but cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonstone dissolves, Elinor’s stance crystallizes, and the arbor’s hush becomes charged poise. Causal chain holds—dust prod → monuments → legible leaves → action plan—though the storm and Lirael remain off-page. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the dust and the burden of new knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arbor is vivid—mossy green haze, dappled shadows, ashen sky—but its constraints on Elinor’s choices are mostly atmospheric rather than tactical. The monuments micro-setting is well-integrated, yet the skyborne scale stays backdrop. Final image of gold bleeding through gray reweights mood effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaf-message—tightens once when moonstone dust makes markings legible. Escalation is a single deepening rather than a reversal; the cost is the irrevocable dissolution of the dust and the new burden of warning others. Agency is clear, though external stakes (storm, Lirael) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of folklore-as-language emerges organically through Elinor’s decoding act; no explicit moralizing. The moonstone’s transformation and the arbor’s listening branches offer resonant non-literal closure. Subtext in the monuments—memory as constellation—adds depth without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“mossy delight,” “ashen skyborne arbor”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elinor’s seed-sorter gaze filters every detail. No dialogue, so no register drift; internal monologue stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Occasional elevated diction (“reverence,” “prophecy”) fits the mythic tone. No loops or scaffold; minor filter verbs (“seemed to lean”) are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Folklore-as-code and skyborne arbor seed-sorting offer fresh synthesis; not a stock fantasy template. Moonstone dust as bridge feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than high-concept twist—but coherence remains high.</comment>
