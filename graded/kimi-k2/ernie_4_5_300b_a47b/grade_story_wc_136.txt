<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>There is visible internal contradiction (artistic yearning vs analytical caution), but the shift from mapping cracks to punching a ticket feels slightly expedited rather than wrestled with, limiting the earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crack-arrows and ticket show one meaningful tightening: they compress vast preparation into a single slot that forecloses safer routes. Closure lands cleanly—the hologram re-weights but does not force a new act, so pressure stalls just before 8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vault’s condensation and fracturing light continuously steer where Elias steps; the mist on skin and brass tool in hand act as micro-setting that pressures the final mechanism swipe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure mounts through the narrowing arrows and mist-chilled hesitation; the escalation is coherent but feels like a single iteration rather than layered costs, so options narrow only once.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of dividing bad habits and new starts rises from the literal visual of glowing arrows yet resists tidy moral, ending on charged irony as the “fortress” reveals its choice-based nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Elias’s haptic focus—fog on eyelashes, brass chill—without head-hop or exterior omniscience, and the lyric rhythm uses long, stuttering sentences when he kneels and tight single beats when the wall shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dense, intentional sentences avoid clutter, but occasional over-extended figurative clusters (“breath of a sleeping giant”) briefly obscure pressure rather than amplify it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The arrows-as-direction trope is transformed by literal glowing cracks and by making the hour divide a physical ticket choice, yet the synthesis could feel inevitable with crisper earlier seeds.</comment>
