<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s face-blindness and methodical empathy are dramatized through tactile sketching and the ribbon’s weight in her pocket; the final micro-choice to frame ribbon beside portrait crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Voss’s weariness supplies relational pressure that forces her to defend her method aloud, tightening their shared stake. Interiority stays embodied and specific, avoiding label-speak. Only the “awaken dormant empathy” line edges toward thesis, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry’s silence lifts, the case reopens, and Clara’s empathy is re-weighted by the locket image. Causal chain—ribbon → sketch → handprint → locket—holds without gaps; each beat narrows options toward reopening the case. Orientation is anchored by word 60. One hairline slip: the dragged indentation appears late yet still feeds the handprint beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mist-clung quarry walls, charcoal grit on lenses, and lantern-shadow geometry constrain Clara’s perceptual choices and charge the final portrait. Sensory hierarchy reflects her face-blind bias toward texture and shadow. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from easel to pit to locket spot. The quarry’s tomb-like atmosphere mirrors internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—revive empathy to reopen Lila’s case—is signaled early and tightened once when the handprint and locket force the detectives to act. Pressure grows under causal lens: each discovery forecloses the “cold case” label. Cost is visible in Clara’s throat-tightening recognition and Voss’s decision to reopen. No escalation beyond one meaningful turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as investigative tool emerges through concrete particulars—charcoal strokes, ribbon silk, locket photo—never stated. Final image of ribbon glowing like a vein of blood reweights the quarry from tomb to living memory. Subtext in dialogue (“You think art can solve…”) carries the debate without slogans. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the empathy will heal or haunt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Clara’s perceptual signature—texture over sight, synesthetic color-bleed—remains consistent and rhythmic. Syntax modulates from long mist-laden sentences to clipped exchanges under lantern light. Dialogue carries subtext: Voss’s rasp vs Clara’s precise diction. No POV drift; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “mist clung…like a second skin” teaches pattern early and pays off in final portrait. No loops, no scaffold, high density. Metaphors serve clarity, not ornament. One near-miss: “furrowed hush” edges toward poetic excess but is earned by tonal consistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind forensic artist who sculpts empathy from stone and ribbon. Masquerade ribbon reimagined as plea for recognition rather than clue. Quarry-as-tomb trope inverted into living archive. Risky compression of cold-case procedural into single lyrical scene pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
