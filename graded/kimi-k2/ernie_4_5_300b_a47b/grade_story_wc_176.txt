<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority—especially the embodied grief of scarred hands and the single word “Lira” breathed but unspoken—shows contradictory impulses: preservation of silence vs. desperate restoration of lost voices. The rope-reweaving choice crystallizes this conflict with immediate, irreversible cost, earning a credible endurance that forecloses his past mute resignation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is airtight: because Kael aligns each braid to the card’s pattern, therefore the rope ignites and the aurora fractures, materially summoning Lira. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—memory made light—whose conceptual cost (forgiveness of self = irreversible absence of mother) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sanctum’s ice, rope, and aurora are not just atmosphere; they exert literal pressure (cold that numbs scarred fingers, rope mechanism that dictates speed). Removing the rope’s frost-tight core breaks the logic of the illumination ritual, and the fracturing aurora becomes the only conduit for Lira’s return—environment actively charging the final image.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the sound of forgotten names”—is tested at every braid alignment, with felt risk of losing the fragile card and the rope’s fray giving way. The decisive tightening occurs when each misaligned thread could silence Lira again; agency is pure micro-choice under glacial constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting absence into light emerges from concrete image (braid glow equals ancestral voice) rather than statement. The final beam piercing ice offers a resonant, non-literal answer—illumination as haunting rather than reunion—charging every prior silence with weighted presence.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct texture in sensory compression—“hands technically gentle despite scars”—and rhythmic control under pressure (short, icy clauses mimic his slowed breath). No head-hopping; POV stays inside Kael’s scarred, wordless perception.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet economical; “cold tasted of snowmelt and iron” carries dual sensory charge. Occasional lyrical stretch (“rope...remembering sunlight”) is earned by scene stakes; no synonym loops or scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally without mechanical repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—lost-wax art transmuted into rope-light alchemy—feels non-obvious and inevitable: metal silence becomes living light. No derivative template; the rope’s braids rewriting themselves offers a specific, unforgettable reconfiguration that sticks.</comment>
