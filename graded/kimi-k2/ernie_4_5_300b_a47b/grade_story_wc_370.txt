<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s grief and reclusive empathy are credibly embodied, but her decisive turn—choosing to stay—relies more on thematic statement than on a dramatized cost. The letters supply motivation yet appear only at the end, so the internal contradiction leading to her renunciation is asserted rather than enacted. Interiority is specific but flirts with therapeutic summary (“felt seen”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain (invitation → map → key → letters) is clean and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s choice to remain re-weights her stance on hiding. Orientation is swift; the library’s geography is legible. Closure cost is present but soft—grief softens rather than a path being foreclosed with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The candlelit library is evoked with selective sensory detail; the mirrors and hollow shelf constrain Eleanor’s final choice. Dust, oak, and glass recur with purpose, anchoring mood and spatial logic. Micro-setting (the crumpled invitation) doubles as tool and keepsake, charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling grief through hidden observation—tightens once: the blank book forces Eleanor to confront what she brings. Pressure is coherent but mild; the society never truly obstructs her. The final cost is emotional insight rather than a forfeited option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Wisdom-through-mistake emerges organically from the mother’s letters and Eleanor’s realization that hiding is also a form of presence. Subtext is carried by mirrors and invitations rather than statement. The ending avoids moralizing, but the theme’s complexity is more gestured than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eleanor’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is consistent (“dust-veiled ceilings,” “glass warping”). Dialogue is minimal but voice-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and strong verbs; occasional elevated diction (“enlarged tranquility”) edges purple but stays within POV lexicon. No loops or scaffold. Density is high; each sentence advances image or motive. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she realized then that”) do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The secret-society library trope is refreshed through tactile detail and the invitation-as-map conceit. The mother’s posthumous guidance avoids cliché by remaining fragmentary. The synthesis of grief work and hidden knowledge feels specific to Eleanor rather than generic fantasy.</comment>
