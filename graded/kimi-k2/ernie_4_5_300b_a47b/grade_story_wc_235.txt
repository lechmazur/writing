<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—hating past selves while envying their certainty—rings true and is embodied in the trembling hands and hollow laugh. Motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” is stated but never tested in a concrete choice; the climb is driven more by scroll than by present-tense need. Final shift from jealousy to clarity is earned by the ritual, but the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the realization that nostalgia is a compass, not a curse, crystallizes in the final paragraph with felt conceptual cost. Causal chain—grave → scroll → ledge → blank scroll → insight—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (cabin to cliff) is clean. Orientation is secured by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mountain, cabin, and ledge are rendered with selective sensory detail (pine resin, bruised sky) that mirrors interior disorientation. The blank scroll and fissure act as micro-settings constraining the final act of inscription. Weather and terrain affect stamina and timing, tightening pressure. No object or setting, however, is indispensable to the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconcile living self with dead past selves. Pressure tightens once—grave forces confrontation, scroll demands ritual, blank page demands new inscription. Cost is conceptual (shedding old weight) rather than tangible. Escalation is steady but leans on symbolic beats rather than irreversible losses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as active construction emerges organically from the chronicler’s task and the scroll’s paradoxes. Subtext in “They knew how to live” reverberates through the final line. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether new narrative will differ. Final image reweights earlier motifs without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is jaded, lyrical, and character-specific—“feral nostalgia,” “collage of contradictions.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under exertion. Compression in “I was everywhere at once” teaches the reader the dream-logic pattern. No dialogue; interior monologue stays coherent and biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective. Occasional near-repetition (“should’ve been comforting but only deepened”) is minor. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. No scaffolding or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of confronting one’s own grave via dream-chronicling is fresh; avoids standard ghost-story beats. Birch scroll and blank reprise transform familiar “message from past self” trope. Specificity of mountain ranger cabin and limping climb grounds the surreal frame. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
