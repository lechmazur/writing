<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is vivid—dreams of silence, the stranger’s face in the pool—but the shift from witness to seeker is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the journey’s cost yet feels slightly abstract because the stakes of “judgment” remain conceptual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper returns lighter, the library now “a bridge,” with the felt cost of self-dissolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fold deepens texture and narrows options—though the origami swan’s causal role fades before the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Library, tunnel, fungi-lit chamber, black-sand cavern—each micro-setting constrains movement and mood. The obsidian refuge itself becomes a state of being, charging the final image; however, spatial anchors could arrive a beat sooner to avoid momentary float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence without judgment—is signaled early and tightened through each fold; the cost is the keeper’s eroding identity, visible in the shattered reflection. One clear deepening suffices, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge as burden, silence as liberation. The final image of the keeper “becoming silence” reweights the library’s decay without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture—the abandoned swan, the backward river—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the keeper’s trance. Sensory diction (“moss-choked,” “iron and old rain”) is filtered through a consistent perceptual signature. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers atmosphere or advances motion. Occasional stacked modifiers (“crumbling peace of a place abandoned by all but the desperate”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds intrude on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The folding map-swan, the library as catacomb, and silence as regenerative state synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh mythic texture. The backward river and vanishing refuge feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
