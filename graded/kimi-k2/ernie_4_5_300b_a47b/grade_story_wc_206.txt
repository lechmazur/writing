<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—reverence for decay yet duty to “mend”—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (needle through reversed gears). Lira’s confession is credible, but Elias’s own flaw (detached savior) is never tested; the cost is hers, not his, so the arc feels half-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each adjustment because/therefore alters the stone’s response until Lira’s truth-telling triggers the decisive tonal shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—box plays the “truth” not the lullaby—cost is Lira’s shame made audible; no causality breaks, though Elias’s stake stays abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Copper walls that “vibrate like the skin of a drum” and runes that “pulse like a heartbeat” ground the chamber as a living constraint; its resonance literally amplifies Elias’s moves, guiding the final tuning. Spatial anchors arrive within 120 words; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—tightens when the stone flares only after Lira’s admission; agency is hers, not Elias’s, which slightly dilutes pressure. One clear cost: the lullaby is gone, replaced by raw truth; escalation is single but sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-as-repair emerges through action: the stone mirrors dishonesty, the box sings only when denial ends. Final image reweights the covenant’s creed without sermonizing; ambiguity lingers—was the lullaby ever real? Subtext in Lira’s fogged breath and the “dust from the rafters” carries the emotional freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, metallic, and rhythmic—“syrup of sound,” “threads of spun starlight”—consistent with Elias’s artisan POV. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“It’s the truth”), distinct from the lyrical narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality. Minor scaffold: “midnight steals light” leans toward aphorism, but it’s earned by prior pattern. No loops or register drift; final chord image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy, luthiery, and moral philosophy braided into a single repair ritual. The “covenant of rust” is a non-obvious moral order; the stone-as-mirror twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
