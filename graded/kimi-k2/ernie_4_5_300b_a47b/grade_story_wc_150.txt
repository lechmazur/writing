<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s motives—to “restore faith”—anchor every step, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“felt then—the faith…as a choice”) rather than concrete embodied tension. The final kneel is visually earned, yet cost reads more atmospheric than viscerally paid. Emotional state is grounded in posture and lantern flicker, avoiding label-speak, keeping flaw visible but not dramatized in scene. Still, character reads as singular, not archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration—sun-dial tone + villagers arriving—yet beats hinge more on textured lyric than causal pivot; “because Lirael placed the stone, therefore” linkage is muffled. Pressure tightens by atmospheric shimmer rather than narrowing choices, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is suggested in “it’s enough,” felt on page but lightly sketched; no constraint recurs to charge tactics. Orientation is anchored early—orchard bones, sundial base cue scene, time stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard root-bones, incense, murals, all vivid and selective; the sundial pedestal matches shape with cinematic precision. Environment subtly guides motion—roots coil, spring appears—acting as active micro-settings rather than backdrop. No setting element constrains final choice directly; glow on walls is atmospheric, not tactical brake. Still, consistency across senses grounds reader in world rules without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—faith restoration—is implicit in shrine resurrection and made legible by harmonic tone & village draw. One micro-turn—choosing to follow the thread instead of abandoning it—lands with atmospheric rather than concrete price. Pressure arcs from curiosity through labor to communal arrival; each beat tightens via textured accumulation rather than antagonistic risk; cost is atmospheric but perceptible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal faith regrows from orchard’s dead bones, seeding belief out of absence. Emerges from particulars—roots over ribs, murals’ star maps—avoiding overt statement until closing “it’s enough.” Resonant but not re-priced; ambiguity of whether ritual magic or mere gathering is real lingers, charging final image with quiet speculation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice leans lyrical-sentiment—sibilance of “roots twisting like serpents,” scent of myrrh—well-balanced compression without drift. Consistent third-person limited; no POV leaks. Perceptual signature filters notice toward ritual detail and tactile roots. Dialogue absent; no voice conflict to judge. Rhythm waxes in dusk paragraphs, breathes in catacomb quiet, guiding mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose musical, syntactically diverse; rhythm ebbs and flows with daylight passage. Occasional mild overwriting—“air grew thick with scent of myrrh” could tighten. Information efficient: lantern glow over murals compresses time into image. Rare near loop—“roots…roots”—but negligible in context. Free of mechanical artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synth of orchard-as-cemetery plus sundial-shrine restoration offers fresh angle on diaspora return narrative; avoids genre cliché by grounding miracle in archaeological labor. Specificity of skeleton orchard versus any graveyard roots story in singular detail. Yet synthesis remains modest—no rule twist deeper than orchard as holy ground. Sufficient non-obviousness to stand.</comment>
