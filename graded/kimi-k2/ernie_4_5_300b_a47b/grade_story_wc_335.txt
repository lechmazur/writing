<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—guardian duty vs. exile reversal—surface in her backward retreat and tea-leaf scrutiny, but the interiority drifts into exposition (“reversible exile was the core concept…”) rather than embodied tension. The mentoring motive is declared, not dramatized until the final exchange, so the cost feels announced rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s “I’ll walk backwards” crystallizes a new path with felt risk, and the shadow’s thinning reconfigures stakes. Causal chain holds—tea reading → literal backward walk → possible reversal—though the exile rule is asserted more than tested on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The ivy-shivering walls, amber shard, and playground creak cohere into a sensory lattice that constrains Lirael’s retreat and charges the final image of shifting light. Micro-setting (mirror shard, tea cup) functions as setting-objects that guide choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will exile reverse?—tightens when the woman’s plea forces Lirael to trade knowledge for action. One clear beat: the backward-walk instruction narrows options and carries implicit cost (exposure, emotional reckoning).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through the shadow’s movement and the literal backward walk, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image reweights the premise quietly: exile’s end is possible but demands facing what was fled.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, hushed, and sensorily precise; the playground creak threading through the library floorboards is a perceptual signature. Free-indirect style stays consistent, and the backward-walk tic is woven into syntax without gimmickry.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with Lirael’s nervous retreat and the woman’s urgency. Occasional elevated diction (“convergence,” “conceptual”) nudges register but remains within the archivist’s lexicon.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror archivist and tea-leaf geometry refresh familiar divination tropes through tactile specificity. Reversible exile as literal backward walking is a fresh, inevitable metaphor that grows from character flaw. Risk is present but not radical.</comment>
