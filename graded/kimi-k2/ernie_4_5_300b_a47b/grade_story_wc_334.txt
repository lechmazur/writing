<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—knees aching, hands trembling—but the interior contradiction between skepticism and belief is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to stay and wait is credible, yet the cost feels more asserted (“weight of the locket eased”) than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes a bridge, not a tomb, and the locket’s silver light reweights the premise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern recognition tightens until memory is restored—though the “price” Clara hints at remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The salt-crusted greenhouse, rusted ladder, and kelp-tangled wrecks are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Elias’s bodily strain. The fairy ring’s ivory caps and the sextant’s brass constrain his mapping choices, charging the final image of broken constellations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s mapping of broken constellations. One clear escalation: finding the locket beneath the mushroom redefines the greenhouse from site to mirror. Cost is conceptual (lost decades) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living constellation emerges organically from Elias’s acts; no moralizing. The final image of the greenhouse as bridge offers quiet, non-literal resonance, though the “price” hinted by Clara remains under-developed subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, elderly, and sea-salted—“chronically curious streak,” “crisp nostalgia of old paper and brine.” Free indirect style stays consistent; no dialogue to test. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the rising tide.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“he’d first stumbled…”) and one mixed metaphor (“celestial blade”). No loops or register drift in peak beats. Density is high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime folklore, marine biology, and star lore; the sunken greenhouse as memory-mirror feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky compression of forty years into one dawn works under Accumulative lens.</comment>
