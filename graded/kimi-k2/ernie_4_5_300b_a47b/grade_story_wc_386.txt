<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is evocative—“windows were fragile things”—but his contradictory impulses remain abstract; no single micro-choice under pressure crystallizes his arc. The final renunciation (placing the globe) is emotionally resonant yet causally under-motivated on-page. Secondary characters appear only as dream cameos, so relationship crucible is absent by scope. Still, embodied grief and vocation-specific perception keep him above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shrine’s ice “hummed” approval, reweighting the premise that truth must be woven, not spoken. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dream shards accrue meaning until the final image reconfigures stakes. One transition (shrine → descent) is legible. Orientation is clear by line 3. Cost is felt but diffuse; a crisper price would push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glacier shrine is more than backdrop: its ice wall thins to let the dead speak, directly enabling Kael’s method. Candle-light and “borrowed starlight” modulate tone with sensory economy. Spatial choreography is clean—globe moves from palm to altar without drift. Micro-setting (warped glass catching last flicker) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage love from wreckage—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as each dream reveals a new facet of the sailor’s lingering love, narrowing Kael’s options to act. Agency is present—he chooses to weave truth into dreams—but the on-page cost (a hum of approval) is more atmospheric than visceral. No external antagonist; internal stakes carry the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection across death emerges through concrete particulars: the melted globe, the lighthouse flame, the unborn daughter. Subtext operates in dream imagery rather than statement. Final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored—the sailor blames the sea, not his son—yet the widow’s grief remains unresolved, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control—“ghosts…danced like ghosts”—and perceptual signature of a diver attuned to pressure and silence. No dialogue, so no register clash. POV remains stable; dream incursions are clearly framed as visions. Compression is purposeful; elisions taught early (“between breaths”) pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“silver smear,” “frozen reeds.” Occasional elevated diction (“commune,” “testament”) fits the ceremonial frame. One mixed moment—“windows…shatter illusions” borders on thematic echo but is brief. Final paragraph cadence earns its lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-diving through a melted snow globe to heal generational grief—is fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (ghost whisperer, shrine) are transformed by specificity of vocation and glacier setting. Emotional specificity anchors the fantastical. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate; execution is confident.</comment>
