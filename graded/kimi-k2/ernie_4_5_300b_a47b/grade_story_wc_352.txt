<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interior kaleidoscope is vivid, yet she remains too competent under pressure; emotional specificity peaks when the chamber shudders, but the flaw struggle feels mild. Micro-choice at the gravity flip earns the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly on the key: a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the grotto’s eye motif and forecloses a path after felt inversion cost. Causal linkage holds under the situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The grotto’s physical trap pressure shapes Lira’s crawl and dais interaction, but only one major turn is tied to the setting itself; specificity offsets scope limits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the 57-minute clock forces Lira’s dash for the threshold; causal pressure dips during middle beats but closes decisively on cost to forestalling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vigilance emerges as a fresh stance crystallized in the final key-handling, but the arc drifts from idea to object rather than reconfiguring worldview with new gloss; still satisfying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm and sensory fabric feel intricate yet controlled, with compression under pressure; occasional register drift into “conceptual” tells is minor enough to preserve clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and atmospheric, though three beats reuse “stone… serpent… key” stems; no loops impair closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The manuscript-to-key motif is specific, non-obvious, and reweighted at the end; the latent-blaze tone synthesizes motifs rather than relying on stock templates.</comment>
