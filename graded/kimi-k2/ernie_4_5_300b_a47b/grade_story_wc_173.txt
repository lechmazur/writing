<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation to defy conformity is declared early and her dance embodies that stance, but interior contradiction is thin; we never feel the cost of chastity or the lure of conformity she rejects. The final “lighter steps” gesture registers as symbolic rather than earned from a specific interior struggle. No secondary pressure or relationship crucible is on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary opens and the echoes are released, reconfiguring Lirael’s stance from burdened to unburdened. Causality is lyrical rather than strict—her dance loosens threads—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the cost (her breath, the cold, the solitude) is visible. Orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The silver-courtyard-under-snow is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the prismatic light; the cold constrains her breath and the crunching snow supplies rhythm. The sanctuary’s glass walls act as both setting and tool, charging the final image. Micro-setting (her body as loom) integrates with action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the echoes—signals early. Pressure tightens once: threads glow, energy builds, then release. Cost is felt (faster breath, cold) but remains light; no credible loss or irreversible trade-off is dramatized. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resistance to conformity emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final image of falling snow as “testament to quiet defiance” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence is present; ambiguity lingers but is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured—“each flake fell like a whispered secret,” “her body a living archive.” Perceptual signature is selective and character-bound. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision (between sigh and smile) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is purposeful and rarely overwrought. Minor scaffold: “each step a sonnet, each gesture a verse” edges toward template cadence but fits the lyric mode. No loops or clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Combining chaste courtesan, prism sanctuary, and bodily-poetic dance is non-obvious and specific. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Some phrasing (“lullaby of conformity”) flirts with familiar lyricism, but the overall angle is fresh and coherent.</comment>
