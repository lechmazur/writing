<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—sweat-slick gloves, smirking under the hat—but the “quietly savvy” trait is asserted more than embodied; the photograph trade carries felt cost, yet the mother backstory is sketched in a single line, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene heist arc under Causal lens: lily→starlight→grate→photo trade, each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the jar illuminates the photo, reweighting theft into gift. Cost is visible in the wilted lily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Emerald station’s amber windows and velvet curtain anchor space early; the jar’s glow and wilted lily act as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, but broader station geography remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—steal moonbeams—signaled at once. Pressure escalates via lock, floor, guard; the photo trade is the decisive tightening that forecloses pure theft. Cost is felt, though escalation is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of theft vs. gift emerges organically through the illuminated photo; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the lily’s language and wilted aftermath. Final image reweights the premise without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is painterly and tactile. No head-hopping. Diction—“prismatic haze,” “dormant star”—serves atmosphere without purple drift. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “jar’s glow washing over her like a second skin.” No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“illuminated moments they trapped”) skirts but never crosses into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: heist of intangible light traded for a stolen memory. Tropes of thief-with-a-heart are transformed through the photo’s re-illumination. Specificity of lily code and moonbeam jar feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
