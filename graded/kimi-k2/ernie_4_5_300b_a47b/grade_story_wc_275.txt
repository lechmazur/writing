<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—daughter of violence turned curator of stillness—powers every micro-choice (burying the ballast, re-purposing the knife). Embodied emotion and sanctuary-forging agency are vivid, and the final re-naming of “quiet” constitutes Earned Stasis with clear cost. However, the one-note absence of an on-page secondary character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and motif reprise escalate until “quiet” seeds its final resonant reconfiguration beneath the dome. Anchors are clear 75 words in, and closure (“the farm…had become a revolution”) crystallizes stakes in a Charged Poise charged with conceptual cost. One minor slack: time-tracking within the dome is fuzzy, but it does not injure the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Selective, sensory-rich grounding—“petals unfurling in the artificial breeze,” “glass refracting…a thousand shades of fire”—establishes the dome’s containment as operative constraint. The roses, sand, and dome all recur to weight Lira’s final choice; setting constrains tactics and charges closure. Only the off-page sandstorm remains decorative rather than generative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform relics of violence into living continuity—tightens via escalating pattern (sand into soil, knife into planter). Pressure is accumulative rather than causal; visible cost (calloused hands, reclaimed ballast buried) earns the stance crystallization. No live reversal, but the deepening succession of charged gestures suffices for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “quiet” as cultivated resistance emerges from Lira’s embodied tending, not exposition. Recurring images (ballast scrap pressed into roots) elegantly reprice the concept at closure—life persists through deliberate stillness. Final paragraph resists moralizing, retaining ambivalence about whether sanctuary equals or avoids systemic change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet vessel-specific: hot glass, thorn-scrape, inherited melody. Compression and patterned return (“quiet” seeding first and last paragraphs) are taught early and paid at closure. No dialogue; free-indirect texture captures the pacifist daughter’s strain toward non-violent artistry. Occasional elevated phrasing (“symphony of containment”) skirts but never crosses into overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, advancing three vectors at once with minimal drift. Brief recurring motif “quiet” handled cleanly; no loops or scaffold emerge. Minor clustered modifiers (“amber…glass…fire”) graze overwritten saturation but halt outside the closing beat, preserving propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fuses post-apocalyptic ranch and pacifist eco-garden in a fresh gestalt: bounty-hunter lineage through gardening, militarized ballast turned fertility. Although the desert glass dome theme risks familiar eco-SF, the transposition of bounty-knife into planter with audible cost denominates an original inflection.</comment>
