<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her ribs ache,” “fingers danced”), but the mapkeeper’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the bloom’s conjuring feels inevitable rather than wrestled with. A single micro-choice—pressing the stone to the spiral—drives the climax, yet the cost (loss of ancient hymns) is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the caves’ song is reborn in duet with hush, and the energy beings are re-contextualized rather than banished. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each crack-pattern examination thickens texture until the spiral releases the bloom. Orientation is swift; stakes compress elegantly within the word count. Cost is felt in the mapkeeper’s creaking joints and the irrevocable tonal shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: ice thickness, spiral geometry, and acoustic properties directly enable the bloom’s emergence. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“sound died and rebirth took its shape”). The echo chamber stone doubles as micro-setting, constraining the final act. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore silence without destroying the energy beings—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory assault. The spiral examination and bloom conjuring constitute one decisive beat that forecloses continued dissonance. Cost is visible in physical pain and the irreversible tonal shift. Agency remains with the mapkeeper; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of balance between sound and silence emerges organically from the caves’ acoustics and the mapkeeper’s ritual. The bloom’s final absorption reweights earlier “fossilized echoes” into a living quiet. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of translucent beings now “wind through leaves.” Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“hammered repose”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, flowing sentences collapse into the hush of the final line. Perceptual signature is consistent: the mapkeeper hears the world in ridges and resonances. No POV leakage; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each image performs double duty (“petals like pressed glass, its center a void”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Rhythm accelerates into the bloom’s release, then exhales into stillness. Minor elevated diction (“cerulean haze”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The acoustic-mythic synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; “fossilized echo” and “bloom of hush” are non-obvious yet grounded. Energy beings reframed as weather rather than antagonists is a subtle inversion. Risk in lyric accumulation is rewarded by coherent closure. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
