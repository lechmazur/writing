<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is vivid—scars “pulse faintly beneath his coat”—and his quiet rebellion is embodied in the drumming. The shared-memory entanglement with the woman is credible, but her sudden appearance and instant exposition (“The lagoon’s memories aren’t just echoes—they’re alive”) undercuts the earned cost of his final acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joint drumming crystallizes Eli’s shift from passive survivor to active co-creator, with the lagoon’s glow as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is more than backdrop; its living vibrations literally respond to Eli’s drumming, tightening his options. The auric lagoon’s shifting colors mirror and constrain his emotional arc. Micro-setting (tree branch, hollow gourd) directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Eli will keep drowning in borrowed sorrow or transform it—tightens once when the woman demands active remembering. The cost is palpable: the sorrow doesn’t vanish but is repurposed into shared rhythm. Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Theme of shared memory as living burden/gift emerges through concrete action, not statement. Final image of “laughter…danced in the same light” offers non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing, though the woman’s line flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Eli’s scarred, percussive perception. Syntax mirrors his heartbeat: longer, breath-held sentences early, staccato fragments during drumming. No POV drift; sensory filter stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative language clusters only where pattern is taught (garden’s “velvet silence”). One paraphrase loop (“memories surfaced…memory—or was it someone else’s?”) dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise clean, propulsive rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “memory as water” trope into a sonic ecology where drumming keeps communal grief alive. The risk—lyric sci-fi that could tip into abstraction—is grounded by tactile detail (scars, gourd, log). Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
