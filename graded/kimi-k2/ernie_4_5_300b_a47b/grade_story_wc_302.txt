<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motives—discovery and vindicated theft—are explicit, but her interiority is often abstract (“cautious exuberance” reads reportorial). Backward-moving watch felt as curiosity rather than cost, and interior contradiction stays summary rather than live contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held; the cipher-driven narrowing from graph to book shelf lands with visible success, but the “backwards watch” never translates to tangible setback or forfeiture—so the closure is luminous rather than costly, making the final beat feel gift-like.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glowing mist shelves and humming watch are vivid and tightly filtered through Lira, but environment never physically obstructs or wounds—no shelf crumbles, no shadow chills. Micro-setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint that scars the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The single stake—to reach the unspoken book—escalates cleanly along the cipher, but tension never risks irrevocable loss; Lira’s progress is uninterrupted except by puzzle. No option is foreclosed; glow simply answers, muting felt urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of unvoiced truths emerges through image (blank pages reveal ghosts), but final beat avoids moral framing, ending on triumphant smile rather than unease about what truths should have stayed silent. Complexity implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is stable, diction lush yet consistent; occasional rhetorical flourishes (mist “curled like ghostly serpents”) approach over-lux but remain voice-coherent. Occasional passive hedges (“seemed to resonate”) dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; sentences carry multisensory load without slack loops. Few near-repeats (“library’s glow intensified” echoing earlier “library’s light”) marginally scuff momentum but never stall the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Unspoken words” chamber and time-cipher are fresh syntheses, avoiding shopworn portal tropes, though backwards watch feels adjacent to Palahniuk/Borges echoes. Freshness in the propagation-delay detail and blank book reveal.</comment>
