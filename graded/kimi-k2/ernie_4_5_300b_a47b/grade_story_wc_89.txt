<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to humanity while surrendering to transformation—are dramatized in embodied beats (feathered fingers, throat tightening). The final metamorphosis is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “reluctant metamorphosis was her lot” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: spice-scent density increases, pattern breaks at climax, closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—bridge-self crystallized with felt cost. Orientation anchored by ~80 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Moonlit orchard, moonthorn petals, and spice mortar constrain tactics and charge the final image; violet glow on skin reappears at transformation. Selective sensory detail filtered through Lira’s bias. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond or lose self—tightens once via irreversible metamorphosis. Agency drives escalation; cost is visible in feathered flesh. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of metamorphosis as rebirth emerges from concrete particulars (ashes, spice, fox feather) without moralizing. Final image reweights fortune’s warning into earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; perceptual signature (silvered stillness, moonthorn scent) remains coherent. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density, rhythmic variation, zero loops. Occasional elevated diction (“cosmic intimacy”) fits fairy-tale register. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar fairy-tale tropes transformed through olfactory magic and reluctant transformation; phoenix-as-ghost feels fresh. Specificity anchors universals; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
