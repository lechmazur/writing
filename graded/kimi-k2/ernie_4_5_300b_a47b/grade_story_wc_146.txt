<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s patience and vocation are sketched vividly, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the single on-page choice—striking the fork—does not visibly cost him anything, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s reawakening is felt, and Kael’s exit under the lingering tone supplies cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Stone, bell-tower, cobblestones, and tuning fork are tactile and specific; the fork’s vibration charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean, though broader geography beyond the square is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal harmony—is signaled early and deepens as footsteps multiply. Pressure tightens once when the bell rings, but the cost is borne by the town, not the protagonist, slightly muting personal stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through patient listening emerges organically from the fork’s resonance and the townsfolk’s returning steps. Final image of Kael walking away while the tone lingers offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to crescendo. Sensory filtering is character-true; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; occasional poetic turns (“ivy clawed at weathered stone”) are purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One near-repeat—“wild hush” used twice—barely registers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Reviving a ghost town via sonic footstep rhythm is fresh; the tuning-fork-as-catalyst avoids cliché. Specificity of occupation grounds the concept, though the premise itself is familiar, slightly limiting the upper band.</comment>
