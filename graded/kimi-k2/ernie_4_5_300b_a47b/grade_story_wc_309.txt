<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his self-doubt, tactile awe, and final tear-tracked smile all land—but the “underachieving” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no spell actually misfires on the page. The garden sketch choice is earned and costly, yet the shift from failure to deserving mage feels compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spire seals, Kael exits lighter, and the cost—loss of the impossible garden—is legible in the final sunlight. Causal chain holds (keystone → sketch → garden → exit) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (ice → garden) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spire’s ice, vapor, and sudden greenhouse are selective and sensory; the fountain’s memory-flash constrains Kael’s final choice. Micro-setting (fountain water, moss under boots) functions as setting and stakes-shaper, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael trades the exotic garden for his mother’s roses. The tightening is driven by his agency and carries visible cost (loss of wonder), meeting the 8.8+ threshold for felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: automation of magic vs. handmade memory. The final image of sunlight on frost reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the fountain’s memory-flash and the roses’ replacement of alien flora is effective, though the epiphany edges close to articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Kael’s perceptual bias—fogged breath, sinking boots, frozen tears. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“accommodates impossibilities”) slightly strains the POV lexicon but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “lingering luminance” is repeated without pattern-teaching. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; momentum holds to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-to-spire premise is refreshed by the garden folly keystone as memory mirror and the automation critique. The synthesis feels specific to Kael’s failure and longing; risk lies in quiet closure rather than spectacle. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
