<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s calm authority and Jorin’s apprentice anxiety are cleanly embodied; the punch’s inheritance and Lira’s lullaby-voice give concrete specificity. Interior contradiction is light—Jorin’s fear is voiced but never collides with another desire in-scene—so the final “choice” to wait feels more inherited than personally earned. Still, the mentor/apprentice status shift is legible and the cost of endless vigil is implied in their dawn stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch left on stone crystallizes the shift from seeking courage to stewarding it, with the felt cost of perpetual return. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stamped tickets and shifting paths deepens meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor causality wobble: the punch glows once early then never again, but this does not rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ridgeway’s mutable geography is vivid and selective—salt-iron air, vanishing paths—yet it never physically constrains a choice; the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting (the mossy stone for the punch) does charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating unused courage—remains abstract; the travelers met are helped, but the protagonists’ own courage is never tested or forfeited. Escalation is textural: each stamped ticket thickens the pattern rather than narrows options. A visible price (endless vigil) is implied at the end, but it is not dramatized on-page during the journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of courage as river, not lake, emerges organically through the act of giving tickets away; no moralizing summary mars the ending. Subtext in dialogue (“learning to see the stars in the dark”) carries implication without declaration. Final image of dawn vigil reweights the premise quietly, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with shoreline-lullaby cadence sustained throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira’s salt-tasting twilight, Jorin’s gravel-crunching boots. No POV drift; dialogue rhythms distinguish elder calm from youthful persistence. Compression (“time blurred”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One minor loop: “the ridgeway’s air hummed… a reminder of the sea” followed two sentences later by “the air here tasted of honey and regret” edges toward sensory checklist, but the cadence shift rescues momentum. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Ferry guides on a reality-bending ridgeway is fresh, yet the core quest for “unused courage” flirts with familiar metaphor. Transformation arrives via the ticket punch’s repurposing—from compass to relinquished burden—making the synthesis feel earned. Specific details (star stamp, shoreline lullaby) prevent generic overlay.</comment>
