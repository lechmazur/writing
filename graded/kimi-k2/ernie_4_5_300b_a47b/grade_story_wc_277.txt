<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clara's contradictory impulses in wanting both legacy and truth create a credible turn; however, her interior monologue tilts into generic "therapy-speak" twice, blunting specificity. The final renunciation carries real cost but is soft-landed by familial apology rather than irrevocable consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds—because Voss hid corruption → journalist's evidence → Clara assumes guilt → she hunts proof → closure—yet a single causality hiccup at the factory report (“Don’t let Clara see this”) feels author-willed rather than driven. Closure lands with visible cost: family rupture and public indictment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The echoing, gear-driven observatory supplies micro-pressure (isolation, secrecy) and its rosewood desk doubles as "setting" that charges choices. Density is high but slightly unbalanced—visual dominates, acoustics underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—legacy vs disclosure—escalates once when the factory memo collapses innocence. Pressure heightens via each contradictory file; cost is legible in family disintegration. Could use one physical prop to ratchet tension mid-arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited sin emerges from concrete discovery, not abstract commentary. Final image—“sunlight” intervention—offers resonant reconfiguration with understated moral cost. Avoids easy moralism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Clara’s star-mapping metaphor; prose modulates well under family and media pressure. No head-hops, filter verbs minimal. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; occasional filler stems (“she stared,” “she thought”) and one metaphor loop (“orbits of regret” thrice). Information density high, no figurative muddle at peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “privileged dynasty exposure” trope is transformed by specific family language and concrete evidence trail. Fresh inflection lies in her ethical self-assassination rather than legal combat.</comment>
