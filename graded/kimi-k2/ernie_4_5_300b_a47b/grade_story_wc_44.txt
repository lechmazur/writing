<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s quiet deliberation is embodied in micro-choices—adjusting telescopes, aligning the key—but her interiority stays generic; the “where shadows go” motive is stated rather than dramatized as a felt contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The final choice (inserting the key) is causally earned yet the cost is only conceptual, not viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal: each beat (key discovery, constellation alignment, insertion) follows because/therefore logic. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—gateway revealed—yet the cost (loss of mystery? risk of backward time?) is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The floating isle’s brass telescopes and shifting constellations are vivid, but only the observatory’s central dais constrains the final action. Sensory detail is selective; spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the closure image but could have tightened further to the key’s mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where shadows go”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the Weeping Archer alignment window narrows options. The cost is conceptual (knowledge of backward-time realm) rather than visceral, limiting escalation intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical closure emerges from the key’s alignment with celestial mechanics; no overt moralizing. The final image of shadows condensing into a gateway reweights prior material without explicit statement. Subtext remains subtle, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature is scholarly, precise. Syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates with tension. No dialogue, so voice distinction is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial mechanics”) fits the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high density, no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and coherent. One mixed moment—“shadows retreating into themselves”—is minor. Momentum is steady; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of rune magic, clockwork keys, and spoon-bent reality feels specific to this world. The backward-time gateway is a non-obvious payoff. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail rather than ornament.</comment>
