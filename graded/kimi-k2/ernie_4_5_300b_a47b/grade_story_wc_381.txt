<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (hush the prophecy) is clear and embodied through tactile ritual; interiority is specific—nebula/earth eyes, paper fibers drinking water. Yet the summoner’s internal contradiction (fear of cosmic roar vs. calm mastery) is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of choice, and the final “smile” feels unearned after the promised cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane-wing dissolves, silence re-orders the haven, and the prophecy is hushed with visible cost (wing turns to dust). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silence-densification culminates in final cadence shift. One micro-turn suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brook, moss, fireflies, and origami wing form a micro-setting that constrains every action: water absorbs the wing, moss cushions knees, firefly-light fractures into constellations. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; environment guides the ritual choice. Final image of resumed murmur recharges the haven as both sanctuary and test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic storm via silence—is signaled early and tightened once: the wing’s absorption narrows options to succeed or lose the haven. Agency is ritual enactment; cost is the wing’s dissolution. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of hush rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as active force emerges through concrete ritual, not statement. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers tracing paper, fireflies pausing. Final image reframes earlier “fragile peace” as something actively re-won, not merely preserved. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the dust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze.” Syntax modulates with ritual tempo—long breaths, then clipped “The brook’s ripples stilled.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression taught early (“silence was not emptiness but a language”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in repeated “hush”/“quiet” stems, but never in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final cadence shift (“As she walked away…”) earns its breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of origami ritual, cosmic prophecy, and silence-as-language feels fresh yet inevitable. Avoids stock “chosen one” tropes; stakes remain intimate. Specificity of midnight-blue paper and nebular eye anchors the fantastical in tactile detail. Risk taken with lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
