<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip on the seal, the candle’s tremble—but the “precisely playful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final integration of foresight/hindsight is earned and carries cost, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes into “architect of the directive,” with the wafer-seal emblem now a compass; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, seal, dream fragments layer until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in her choice to walk out and let the bunker decay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker is tactile and atmospheric, constraining movement and muffling sound; the storm’s live pressure alters tactics (dream amplification). Micro-setting (seal, candle, vines) charges the final image when Mara presses the emblem into earth, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once as the hologram’s question reframes the directive from command to seed. The storm’s approach supplies a live clock, and the final choice to integrate decay and growth carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mara’s integration of decay and renewal; the directive’s redefinition from failure to seed is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior images without moralizing. Final image of footsteps “grown” by willing hands offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with perceptual signature—“raindrops clung to her lashes like diamonds”—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays coherent. Experimental compression (dream fragments) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and theme. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise fuses ecological collapse, lucid dreaming, and post-directive myth into a fresh synthesis; the wafer-seal and rewilded bunker feel specific and inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure; transformation test passes—story would collapse if relocated.</comment>
