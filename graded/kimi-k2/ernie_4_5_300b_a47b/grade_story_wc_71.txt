<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“fingers brushing a shard…smelled of forgotten gardens”—but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final smile feels unearned because no prior flaw or cost is dramatized. Motivation is clear, yet the absence of a visible renunciation or mistake caps emotional depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each displaced object layers hush until the bay’s sanctification reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the houses now felt alive”—with conceptual cost (Lira’s worldview irreversibly altered), though the price could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bay’s quiet and amber streetlights are filtered through Lira’s perceptual bias; the orris root shard and other objects function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual. Final image of pulsing houses ties environment to closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to understand why some houses feel alive”—is signaled early and deepened when the ritual succeeds, narrowing Lira’s future path. Escalation is textural (density of hush), but the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-potential emerges organically from the displaced objects and orris root’s “fixing” property. Final image reweights the mundane/ineffable bridge without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could resonate more sharply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—“inadvertently profound” coined in dream, “daydreamed in their amber haze”—and perceptual signature consistent. No dialogue, but free-indirect texture and rhythmic control under pressure are exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only minor scaffold (“the way a window frame leaned…”) and no mixed metaphors. Density is high; each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual. One paraphrase loop docks 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore, quantum curiosity, and perfumery; displaced objects as “anchors of hush” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off, though not quite transformative enough for 9.0+.</comment>
