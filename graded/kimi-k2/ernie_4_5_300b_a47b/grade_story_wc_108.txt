<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses (genetic fear vs adaptive drive) are embodied in trembling hands and micro-choices; the final refusal to hand over the shell crystallizes her stance with felt cost. Mother-daughter status shift is only off-stage, so relationship crucible is weak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell’s whisper drives Lila to library → decrypts notes → outwits enforcer → closure in café. Closure is Earned Stasis: she withholds the shell, foreclosing easy reconciliation. Cost is the ongoing estrangement she now chooses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rusted library is sketched with decaying scripts and groaning shelves; the pink child’s cast functions as micro-setting that constrains the decryption beat. Sensory detail is selective but vivid; no single object charges the final image, capping at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“vulnerability as power”—is tested when Lila weaponizes her phobia to dodge the enforcer. One meaningful tightening: the decrypted notes narrow her options to confront or flee. Cost is the irreversible public exposure of her mother’s crimes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Lila’s embodied struggle rather than statement; final café image reframes vulnerability as currency without moralizing. Subtext in shell’s withheld whisper carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and cinematic—“rusted library under stars,” “voice smooth as poison.” Interiority stays within Lila’s lexicon; no POV drift. Distinct perceptual signature in stunt-double kinesthetic detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“tidal pull,” “conceptual repricing”) stays character-bound. One paraphrase loop (“vulnerability isn’t weakness… it’s a language”) is minor; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double phobia as tactical asset, heirloom seashell as decryption key. Betrayal is generational rather than romantic, avoiding cliché. Risky compression of mob plot into 800 words pays off.</comment>
