<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kieran’s vigilance and Elara’s calm inventiveness are sketched through action and dialogue, but interior contradiction is thin; the final choice to descend feels more strategic than emotionally fraught, so the cost is intellectual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: blackout → test → decipher sundial → open cradle; closure lands with a visible shift (lights still out, plans now secured). One minor ellipsis—how Elara “tracked” the blackout sequence—keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fort’s twilight glow and blackout darkness are woven through Kieran’s watch; the sundial’s bronze angles and hidden staircase anchor spatial choices. Micro-setting (quill holder as key) constrains the final move, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—igniting the revolution—tightens when the blackout becomes a Council test; the sundial’s solution narrows options to one hidden chamber. Cost is implied (discovery = death) but not yet viscerally paid, capping just below 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance emerges through objects and actions rather than statement; the cradle as “idea not place” reweights the fort’s glittering oppression. Final image of flickering ideas avoids moralizing, but resonance is moderate rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kieran’s watchful sensorium; diction is controlled, with occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous fort held its breath”) that fits the heightened mood. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, though Elara’s voice could be more distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One scaffold phrase—“the cradle of sparks wasn’t a place but a idea”—slips into tell, and “winking hush” edges precious, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines familiar rebellion tropes with a fresh lock-and-sundial cipher; the astronomer’s abandoned dial and bronze quill holder feel specific to this world. Risk is moderate—quiet infiltration rather than spectacle—but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
