<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—archive loyalty vs. truth—drives the single decisive act of reviving Kael, but the shift from observer to rebel is asserted more than dramatized; we feel her trembling yet never see the specific micro-choice that tips her. Kael’s awakening supplies minimal relationship pressure, so the crucible is internal only. The cost (Council retaliation) is named, not embodied. Still, traits are consistent and embodied emotion is present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she receives contraband truths, therefore she awakens Kael, which irrevocably changes her status. Orientation is swift; closure is a clear Decisive Change with implied cost. One minor causality wobble: the “dormant networks” appear only at the end as explanatory afterthought rather than shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The echoing, snow-burdened library is vivid, selective, and thematically apt; frost and silence act as active pressure. Micro-setting (cryo-chamber glass, ice blooming under palm) constrains the pivotal choice. Spatial choreography is clean. A touch more sensory narrowing under stress would push it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned history—is signaled early and tightens once: awakening Kael forecloses her safe archivist path. The cost is named but not yet felt on the body, so pressure peaks conceptually rather than viscerally. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of censored history emerges organically from action; the final image of “the revolution began” risks a touch of editorial summary but still lands as earned resonance. Subtext in the silent hand-off of the letter is effective. No overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, atmospheric, and slightly elevated to match the mythic tone; perceptual signature centers on cold, echo, and glass. Free indirect style stays coherent. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; rhythm modulates with tension. Occasional poetic overlap (“dizzying quiet of the library was shattered by the unspoken conversation”) flirts with overwriting but remains controlled. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cryo-archive as rebel resurrection ground feels fresh; the story synthesizes familiar dystopian tropes through the specific lens of a frozen library and a lone archivist’s micro-choice. The final hand-off avoids cliché. One more sensory twist would secure full originality.</comment>
