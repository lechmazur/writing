<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias exhibits clear contradictory impulses: scientific detachment collides with intuitive urgency. The transition from "he’d always avoided politics" to taking a vial directly into peril roots the interior shift in on-page beats; yet the woman-in-lab-coat functions as a generic prompt rather than a second character under status pressure, constraining the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal; the because/therefore chain holds from trembling recorder → pigeon → rooftop detour → biohazard alarm → decisive exit. Closure arrives as an earned renunciation (burning the note) with felt cost: the courtyard’s “quiet endorsement” after forfeiting solitude lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The brass storm recorder constrains tactics (beeping alert, data screen, sample case) and re-charges the final image when it stills at the close; the rooftop vista and fog-choked clinic are vivid yet briefly sketched. Strong but not indispensable: the physical world could be substituted without collapsing logic.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“document the unseen vs preserve sterile integrity”—is signaled early and tightened once: burning the courier slip forecloses safe isolation. The price is visible: deliberate exile from his carefully curated solitude. One meaningful deepening is sufficient and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of bearing witness versus sterile autonomy is woven through images of record vs. blood, silence vs storm; the courtyard’s reclaimed “layered tranquility” reweights the earlier sanctuary. The final burning of the strip becomes a non-literal answer to the thematic question with conceptual cost.</comment>

<comment>Voice owns a precise metrological lexicon (“dials etched with weather symbols,” “erratic pressure readings”) that remains consistent under stress; no head-hop. Prose modulates cadence with tension: the rooftop glide is clipped, the clinic descent compressed.</comment>

<comment>Syntax propels cleanly without paraphrase loops or scaffold. “Ash instead of rain” surprises the ear; density is high—e.g. “tonight, the air tasted different” carries data, sensation, foreboding in five words. No overwriting at peak beats.</comment>

<comment>The storm recorder plus pigeon courier is an original compression of steampunk whistle-blower noir; the rogue-zone revelation risks cliché until paid off by the clinic’s engineered plague. Specificity of ash storm and recorder readouts anchors the concept, though broader world remains familiar near-future dystopia.</comment>
