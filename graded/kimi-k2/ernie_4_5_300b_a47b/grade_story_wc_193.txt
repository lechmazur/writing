<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s pyramid-scheme past and “virtuously mischievous” streak are signaled early and motivate her decisive turn of the bolt, but interiority is thin—her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in the moment of choice. The felt cost (loss of certainty, possible collapse) is present yet abstract; a crisper embodiment of fear or regret would raise the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single-scene structure is clean; orientation anchors by ~100 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—turning the bolt dissolves the diamonds and reconfigures the farm’s pressure—yet the causal chain from bolt to diamond dissolution is lightly sketched rather than rigorously earned. Cost is legible but diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is vivid, selective, and purposeful: cobalt/violet glows, fungal canopies, crystalline spores. The submarine bolt is handled twice (touch, turn) and constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“harvest diamonds before implosion”—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must decide whether to trust the device. One meaningful turn (turning the bolt) narrows options and averts collapse. Cost is present but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of translating abstract pressure into resilience emerges through action rather than statement. The final image of glowing, stable mushrooms offers a resonant, non-literal payoff. Subtext is light but coherent; no overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara; perceptual signature is consistent (squinting at glow, fingers brushing cold metal). Prose is textured without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal yet natural and goal-driven when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and information density; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor scaffold: “the farm hummed like a living organism” is serviceable but not fresh. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid-scheme trauma, quantum promise device, and bioluminescent pressure farming. The submarine bolt as key feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity grounds the speculative frame; risk-taking is coherent and clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>
