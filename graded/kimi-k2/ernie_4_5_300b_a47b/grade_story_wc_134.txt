<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and hesitation are embodied in micro-choices (touching the crystal, closing fingers around the pearl), but the interior contradiction between wanting control and accepting chaos is stated more than dramatized; the final “steady, unpredictable hum” hints at earned change yet lacks a visible cost on her body or stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s song re-stabilizes but now carries the “unpredictable hum” inside Elara, a felt cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory intensification reweights the stake of control vs. surrender. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cave’s living acoustics and prismatic light actively constrain Elara’s perception and finally inhabit her, turning setting into interiorized pressure. Selective sensory detail (violet-gold flares, liquid melody) is filtered through her clairvoyant bias and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over everyday magic—tightens when the pearl fractures the cave’s harmony, forcing Elara to accept the darkness threading the light. One clear intensification suffices; cost is the irreversible change in the cave’s song and her own sensorium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing chaos within order emerges from the pearl’s disruption and the pilgrim’s vanishing, not from overt statement. Final image of the altered song offers a non-literal answer: brightness and darkness are twins, reconfiguring the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s clairvoyant perceptions; diction (“molten silver,” “prismatic patterns”) is consistent with her heightened senses. Rhythm modulates with tension—longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments during fracture—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“shadows that seemed to pull the light into themselves”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or paraphrase drift; syntax remains clean and purposeful, advancing image or pressure each line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of clairvoyance, living cave, and overlapping-shadow arrival feels fresh; the pearl as key rather than tool reconfigures familiar magic-cave tropes. Specificity of sensory magic and the pilgrim’s dissolution avoid template echoes.</comment>
