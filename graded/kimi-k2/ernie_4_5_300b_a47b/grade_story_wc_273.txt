<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—finding her erased brother—is clear and visceral; her anger is embodied (“quiet fire that burned through restraint”) and shapes micro-choices (spilling ink, defying elders). Interiority wobbles only once when “consciously wild intuition” is declared rather than shown, but contradiction and embodied cost remain intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: crash → ink ritual → hologram → door opens; each beat advances knowledge and narrows options. Closure is decisive—“she pressed her palm … and stepped inside” forecloses other paths with cost (she can no longer turn back). Slight ellipsis on Tower rules, but causality endures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sand, wind, fading eclipse light, drone wings, disappearing ink, and the child’s scratched circles are vivid, selected, and tied to choice (ink patterns are read, the drone’s hologram anchors next move). Micro-setting objects (vial, drone) constrain options and charge the final image; no over-descriptive stall.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover temporal truth and her brother—introduced early; pressure tightens from drone discovery to Tower gate. One clear pivot: hologram forces the choice to enter. Cost on page: defying elders, risking Tower entrapment. Escalation coheres under causal lens without gratuitous turns.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory erased by mutable time emerges through disappearing ink, fragmented circles, and the Tower mirror; never preached, only shown. Final image (door opening into possible erasure) poses a non-literal question without sloganizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited POV remains stable; diction is taut (“sand shifting beneath her boots,” “glow like bleached bone”) and rhythmic. Dialogue only with child, brief but voice-differentiated. No POV slippage; elision (how ink cypher broken) is purposeful and closure-legible.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Syntax propels without clutter; metaphors mixed only once (“time slowed because it chooses to”) in elders’ mouth, not narrator. Near-duplicates minimal. High information density; no artifact in final third. Small tic—multiple “Lira [verb]” openings—does not obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Disappearing-ink as code and Tower that pools time feel fresh; eclipse as erasure is recontextualized beyond trope. Synthesis of drone tech and tribal oracle registers as inevitable without gimmickry. One recognizable phrase—“time gets stuck like a song on repeat”—leans cliché, but overall risk succeeds.</comment>
