<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—seeking closure yet fearing memory—are embodied in the scar’s ache and the trembling hand. Micro-choices (touching the hourglass, descending the tunnel) align with motive and escalate cost. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she accepts the scar as bridge, not map. Interiority stays concrete, though “raw and hyperaware” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hourglass shatters, reweighting the scar from wound to story. Causal chain—hourglass → tunnel → visions → acceptance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each coffee-ring portal tightens pattern and stakes. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the burning scar and the tear-darkened floor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tower’s damp stone and ivy roots constrain movement and whisper intel; the scar itself becomes micro-setting that guides choice. Selective sensory detail (frost crackling in teeth, coffee-ring edges browned) supports urgency. Final image of dawn light reframes the tower from crypt to threshold. Environment does not merely backdrop but shapes the descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—read the scar’s story without drowning in grief—is signaled early and tightened by each portal. Agency: Mara chooses to descend, to touch, to keep watching despite pain. One deepening beat—mother’s “stories are written in scars”—reweights the stake. Cost is visceral: scar burns, tears fall, hourglass shatters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific images: hourglass, scar, coffee rings. Subtext in plant whispers and the meteor hush avoids moralizing. Final smile and lightened heart reconfigure meaning without stating a moral. Complexity preserved: grief not erased but transmuted into readable text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet grounded in sensory immediacy (“hum that vibrated in her teeth”). Perceptual signature filters detail through Mara’s hyperaware post-surgery state. Compression and elision taught early (“tunnel opened beneath her, not of earth but of memory”) remain legible. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional elevated diction (“displaced miracle trapped between moments”) risks register drift but stays within lyric allowance. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short gasps during visions, longer cadences at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-quest refreshed by hourglass-as-memory-tunnel and telepathic ivy. Coffee-ring portals feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Specificity of scar-as-text and tower-as-time-dam distinguishes from stock tropes. Risk in lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
