<comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to the chalk yet despairing of its fading power—manifests in embodied actions like "knelt by a... sculpture" and "hands raw." The final micro-choice—thicker chalk line after renouncing foresight—shows earned cost. The curse label "precognitive forgetfulness" skirts diagnostic shorthand but is grounded in sensory stakes, so only a hairline slip.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Anchored by ~80w; clear one-scene arc driven by causal search ("because he needs the sound, therefore he rearranges driftwood") compressing toward the Earned Stasis of renouncing future-sight. Fog, chalk, and rebar sculpture each constrain later moves. Closure image—"thicker line"—bears unmistakable conceptual cost ("I don't need the future anymore").</comment>

<comment>Garden fog grips choices: drifting visibility dictates when Elias hears the hum and where he kneels; rebar tower becomes directional organ by echo shape. Spatial cues are precise ("crunch on gravel," "leaned ear to cold metal") without ornament. A top-echelon story could hinge the image still more on environmental agency, so -0.2 short of gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound—tightens through spatial displacement and material endurance until Elias stands immobile by the tower and accepts aging vibration as sufficient. Cost: renounces precognition; tension not external but experiential. One clear "sound of growing older" climax suffices for 600 w scope.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. foresight emerges not in statements but in tactile choreography: chalk line = claim on future, thicker line = acceptance of forgetting. Final reweighting of "sound of growing older" from elusive quarry to lived present is resonant without moralizing. Minor residual sentiment in "tidal longing" phrase prevents 8.0+.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrid compression matches POV: "fog clung... like a second skin" sensory and specific. Syntax modulates—short percussive verbs under pressure, then longer breath for the closure hum. Unflinching focalization; no register drift; every sensory detail filtered through Elias’s sensory bias. Near-exceptional control.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies without loops; sentences propel ("shuffled through the mist, his boots crunching...") while economy deletes filler. Occasional elevated "hush of old videotapes left unwatched" flirts with poetic excess but serves temporal hush. No clarity loss, one negligible paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Junkyard prophet seeking "the sound of growing older" reframes familiar memory/aging theme via auditory metaphor and sculptural setting. No trope duplication; internal logic specific to Elias’s synesthenic listening and driftwood ritual. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Fresh and non-obvious at this length.</comment>
