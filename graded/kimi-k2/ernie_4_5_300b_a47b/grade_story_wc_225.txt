<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are embodied in the tactile handling of threads and ring-fidget; the final renunciation of blame is earned through the memory beat and the cost of accepting unchangeable loss. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-dramatized in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the village unfreezes and Alaric steps away with “all the time in the world,” a Charged Poise that reweights his exile from punishment to vocation. Causal chain—pluck thread → memory → path revealed → pedestal → hush → unfreeze—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irreversible death of the prince, felt in the black thread beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Alaric’s choices; the shifting light on the labyrinth walls and the pulsing threads charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the black thread forces confrontation with the prince’s death; the winnowing action narrows options to acceptance or endless guilt. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the memory’s “mix of betrayal and fear.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as weaving unchangeable threads into new fabric emerges organically from the tapestry and labyrinth imagery; final image of the intact tapestry offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the prince’s smirk and Alaric’s silence carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Alaric’s perceptual signature; diction (“fierce repose,” “woven hush”) is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; “fidgeted productively” is the only compressed phrase and it earns its keep. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village + chess-tutor guilt + tapestry-labyrinth is a fresh synthesis; the metaphor of chess moves as irreversible life choices is transformed through tactile thread-work. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off.</comment>
