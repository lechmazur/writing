<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marlow's quietly grieving artisan identity convinces (calloused hands, lantern rituals), interiority is specific, and the final renunciation—burying his own poem in stone rather than words—carries clear cost. The flaw/need balance falters only in the middle, where grief feels summarized rather than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens chosen as Accumulative/Textural; causality holds through “Because poems linger, therefore Marlow rewrites ritual.” Closure unit (poem recited, voice gone, thundering calm) lands with visible, felt cost: the inherited sorrow becomes the stone he must now shape. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse breathes as active participant—shadows as spirits, butterfly silhouettes charging the lantern’s final glow—constraining Marlow’s last choice to speak inside living memory rather than outside it. Sensory detail is selective, voice-biased, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform inherited silence into communally shared grief—tightens through each visitation; micro turn when poem becomes carved stone narrows options from spoken word to permanent mark. Cost (Marlow’s silence transferred into stone) is visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete choices (poems in vines, poem in stone) and resists tidy moral; final resonance—“hope of those who will follow”—reweights earlier burdens without stating a lesson, avoiding Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical prose and restrained metaphor form Marlow’s perceptual signature; syntax modulates with pressure—short, breath-caught phrases near lantern, longer exhalations during recitation. Voice remains coherent; minor template stems in middle beats keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is compact, vivid, rhythmically varied, with only two paraphrase loops (“words linger… poems linger”) mid-story—non-obscuring. Metaphors stay physical: “ribbons spill like bruise.” Final image retains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Gravestone artisan listening to greenhouse poems synthesizes familiar motifs (grief, memory, nature) into fresh angle, yet risk remains tempered. Charged reprise of ribbon in final stone raises score within band.</comment>
