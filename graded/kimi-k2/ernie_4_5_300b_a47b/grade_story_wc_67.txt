<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory drives—art vs annihilation—show in scene, but the mask and ash are more prop than extension of self. Choices feel horizonal, not narrowing, until the final pieta image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure comes as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira leaves the portrait unfinished, accepting temporal fragility; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of ash-haze reweights the stake). One causality gap—why unfinished matters now instead of later—keeps it from 7+. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The gallery’s impossible angles and fading artworks pressure the illusion-of-safety concept, mirroring Lira’s faith in art as refuge while foreshadowing its impossibility; the space is specific enough to feel irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Escalation is accretive: each beat deepens the contradiction between preservation and obliteration; ash smudges, porcelain mask, and silence build toward the unmade portrait. No external pressure—only interior tightening—limits higher score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via the gap between what art can capture and what memory destroys; the final unfinished image reframes longing as absence without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lira’s sensory decay; porcelain mask’s jagged edges, soot-smeared fingers, and rocking-chair rhythm create a consistent perceptual signature. Some register drift toward literary lyric is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but precise; verbs like “glittering like stardust” justify the lyric register. No paraphrase loops, but a few mixed metaphors (“second heart,” “armor of regret”) dull the knife edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The ash portrait vanishing is a fresh turn on ephemeral art; the mask and gallery tropes are legible symbols but not radically transformed. One sharp inflection—leaving the work unfinished—earns moderate originality credit.</comment>
