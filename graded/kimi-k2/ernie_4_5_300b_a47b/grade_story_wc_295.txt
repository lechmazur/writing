<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her breath fogging equations, the prism warming her palm—yet the brother’s vanishing is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the personal stake. The final surrender to shared grief is embodied and costly, earning the shift from observer to bearer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers grief-glyphs until the temple’s mirror reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lirael steps into the hologram, accepting the lullaby etched on her skin—cost legible in the dawn light outside.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s frosted dome, brass sextant, and prism constrain choices and charge the final image; the temple hologram’s mosaic floor grounds the climax. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, though “silver moth trapped in amber” edges ornate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or lose the temple’s shifting verses—tightens when Veyra warns of erasure. The prism’s hologram forces Lirael’s surrender, narrowing options from chronicler to bearer of others’ grief; cost is the lullaby scar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-translation emerges through glyphs that demand bearing others’ pain; no moralizing, only the final lullaby in her brother’s hand. Subtext in the prism’s warmth and the daylily’s brittleness reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“stars pooled like melted silver”—with controlled psychic distance. Veyra’s dialogue is spare and urgent, distinct from Lirael’s denser interiority. No head-hopping; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional ornate phrasing (“daylily-pressed telegram”) is earned by pattern. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Metaphors cohere under dream-logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid cartography meets grief-etched temple walls. The variable stars as empathy mirrors is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
