<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “tracing the cracks,” the damp violin strings—but the final choice to “hold up the bowl” and declare its purpose feels slightly abstract; the cost of that renunciation (the chronic hush she relinquishes) is implied rather than dramatized on her body. The micro-choice sequence is coherent, yet the contradiction between her restlessness and the calm acceptance at the end is not fully earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence is reweighted from wall to threshold. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each note thickens the pattern until the bowl glows. The cost is visible in the crowd’s tentative murmur, but the causal linkage between bowl and transformation could be one degree sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass acoustics and salt-fogged windows constrain Lira’s sound experiment; the shipwrecks’ groan is an active pressure. The micro-setting (copper bowl on stone floor) charges the final image. A few extra sensory anchors (temperature, footing) would push it to 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loosen the knot of grief—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the bowl begins to vibrate, forcing Lira to reframe silence as potential. The price is the crowd’s fragile, audible risk, but the escalation is more cadence shift than irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges organically from the cracked fiddle and charred twigs; no overt moralizing. The final image of “light in the ash” offers a non-literal reweighting. A touch more ambiguity in the crowd’s response would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail—“damp, earthy scent,” “salt-crusted wood.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer coils of description yield to clipped final declarations. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean, with purposeful rhythm and no loops. One near-repeat—“music seemed to pool… chronic hush”—is minor. Figurative language is selective; the “glass cathedral” risks grandeur but is balanced by grit. A stray filter verb (“she realized”) in the climax could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The post-apocalyptic greenhouse orchestra is fresh, yet the “bowl that holds space” flirts with familiar magic-object territory. The transformation of silence into potential feels earned because the acoustics and setting are specific. Slight deduction for the near-archetype of the grief-healing performance.</comment>
