<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and caretaker identity are vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mind often adrift”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final renunciation to rebury the case is credible yet feels lightly costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s understanding reweights the silo’s purpose—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the tapestry’s threads tighten meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, chess clock, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices; moonlit shimmer and oculus star-map ground the scene sensorially. Setting actively guides the final image rather than merely decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the dead’s intentions—tightens once when the tapestry map is decoded; pressure is coherent but escalation is more accretive than sharply intensifying. Cost is conceptual (knowledge gained, path foreclosed) rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening to the “silence between moves” emerges organically from tapestry and clock; final image of gardener-as-tender-of-time offers resonant non-moral answer. Avoids overt thesis, though “shape of intentions” flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lush, velveteen diction is consistent and character-bound; perceptual signature is strong (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt walls seeming to pulse”). No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on lyrical interiority that modulates with discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked modifiers (“velveteen gloom of a cobalt silo under stars”) risk overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with beats. Metaphors cohere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Chess-clock-as-metronome for the dead and tapestry-as-temporal-map feel fresh; premise synthesizes caretaker, crypt, and game into singular vision. Specificity of repurposed silo and frayed constellation threads resists generic treatment.</comment>
