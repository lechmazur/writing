<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rusted chain link anchors her contradictory need for both stability and expansion. The final beat crystallizes her stance—teaching others to embrace the unknown while still holding the anchor—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lirael’s declaration that “we must learn to navigate not just by what we see, but by what we feel” reweights the premise and forecloses her own drift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure tightens through layered imagery rather than causal turns, and the cost is felt in her somber marvel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The benthic city is evoked with selective, pressure-driven detail—cold water, softened spires, faint crystal glow—yet the chain link ultimately constrains choice more than the environment itself. The setting’s atmospheric weight supports the theme but does not directly alter the final maneuver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Lirael’s need to steady herself while guiding others—escalates through the students’ question about shifting alien lights, forcing her to articulate adaptive principles. The tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as existential orientation in mutable darkness. The anchor’s reprise reweights earlier material without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance. A hairline slip toward thematic statement in the final paragraph keeps it just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lirael’s disciplined wonder. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature—“edges, boundaries, the geometry of the unknown”—threads cleanly through beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, with only minor scaffold (“she would say,” “she began to explain”). Figurative language is purposeful; no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase loop near the middle docks 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of alien bioluminescence, underwater cartography, and rusted surface relic feels fresh and inevitable. The anchor’s transformation from dead weight to geometric tool is a non-obvious turn that deepens the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
