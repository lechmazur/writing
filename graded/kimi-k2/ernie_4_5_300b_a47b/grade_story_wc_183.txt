<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the garden while fearing its cost—are embodied in her wing brushing the name-flower; the final sewing of their joint name into soil crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Veyra’s skepticism provides relational crucible pressure that shifts to acceptance. Minor slip: “blissfully aberrant” is label-speak mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the meadow appears only after Lira chooses remembrance over denial, paying with the ship’s dissolution. Causal chain holds—emerald card → lullaby → door → seed → garden—each step narrowing options. Fog’s parting is earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ship’s decay and fog constrain every move; the calliope’s salt-caked keys and nameplate walls are tactile obstacles that must be engaged to advance. Final meadow reconfigures the decay into bloom, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the garden or remain nameless—is tested by Veyra’s doubt and the ship’s entropy. One decisive tightening: Lira’s choice to sew their name into soil forecloses retreat to the ship. Cost is the ship’s erasure and the irreversible exposure of their fused identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance vs. erasure emerges through the seamstress’s journal and the blooming name-flowers; no moralizing. Final twin-petaled flower offers non-literal answer: identity is cultivated, not retrieved. Subtext in Veyra’s softened growl carries acceptance without speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“growl-hiss hybrid,” “leonine forelegs scraping”—with consistent perceptual signature. Compression in final paragraph mirrors the cadence shift to openness. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in Lira’s hybrid sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold. “Unkindled solace” is the only elevated diction that momentarily drifts from POV lexicon, but it is immediately grounded by embodied action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fused chimera twins seeking a garden of names on a derelict carnival ship is a fresh synthesis; the seamstress’s stitched journal threads fairy-tale logic into post-war decay. Risky premise fully commits and pays off in the earned meadow.</comment>
