<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused fingers, warmth of amber, loom’s creak—yet her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation is foreshadowed and carries visible cost (loss of bead, loom stilled), satisfying the Earned Stasis test. Minor slip: “wistful hope” is label-speak that could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s sacrifice reconfigures the orchard’s silence into song and the distant village’s fate. Causal chain—bead → puzzle → twin bead → release—holds without gaps; cost is legible in the dimming beads and floating loss. Orientation is anchored early; one transition (puzzle completion) is clean. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective—liquid-gold light, creek-silt box, bamboo roots tripping Mara—yet the orchard itself never physically constrains her final choice; the loom and beads do. Micro-setting (loom, beads) functions as charged objects that enable the closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (rain-soaked morning). No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sound to the world—signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each puzzle-fit thins silence, culminating in the twin-bead fusion. Final tightening forces the trade-off: keep bead (silence) or release it (song). Cost is visible in the floating bead and stilled loom. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice as generative act emerges from concrete particulars—loom, beads, puzzle—without moralizing. Final image of children laughing with Mara’s name echoing reweights prior silence without stating a thesis. Subtext in the beads’ warmth and the crow’s mockery deepens stakes. Avoids tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; patterned elision (“silence bloomed into sound”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature—stoically sparkling hues, liquid-gold light—remains consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in calm moments, clipped fragments during chase. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor overwriting in “stoically sparkling hues” but does not obscure clarity. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: silence as tangible fabric, puzzle as cipher, loom as conduit. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity. Risk in lyric mode pays off—closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
