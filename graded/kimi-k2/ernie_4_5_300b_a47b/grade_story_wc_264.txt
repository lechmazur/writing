<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s dreamlessness and freight-guard role anchor early beats; his interiority is thin but the “ache of absence” at the archive gives a felt pivot. The final dream arrives as earned reconfiguration rather than epiphany, yet prior micro-choices are more observed than enacted. Relationship with the woman remains spectral, so status pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s first dream reweights the archive’s purpose and the ticking clock signals cost. Causal chain—clock → choice → dream—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent sand and crystalline towers are vivid and selective; the dune’s pulse constrains Kael’s footing and later erupts into light at climax. Spatial choreography is coherent; the chess clock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cultivate sparks before they fade”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Kael must choose to twist the clock hands, trading his dreamlessness for the archive’s survival. Cost is visible on-page as the dune erupts and the coat of light is assumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of imagination’s absence/presence emerges from concrete events; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “tiny flames” reweights earlier “burnt honey” scent into nascent renewal. Subtext operates through gesture—the coat left behind—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael; perceptual signature is freight-guard practical (“cataloging flickers like a librarian of lost fire”). Compression and lyric patterning are consistent; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; metaphors are purposeful (“sand pulsed like a heartbeat”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“labyrinth of crystalline towers”) fits the elevated setting. Final sentence cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic dream-archive is fresh synthesis; chess-clock-as-bridge avoids cliché. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Specificity—“symbols of waves and particles”—grounds the speculative frame.</comment>
