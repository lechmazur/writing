<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s reckless curiosity and skeptical stance are embodied through tactile micro-choices (turning the valve, fumbling the recorder), but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he’d sought proof…found something worse”). The final renunciation—leaving the valve—earns its cost via prior dread, yet the emotional layering feels slightly compressed for the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (enter tunnel → fit valve → descend → witness hologram → leave) tightens options under a clear “because/therefore” chain. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias abandons the valve—whose weight is felt in the etched beads. One minor ellipsis: the psychic clip’s payoff is slightly convenient, but it doesn’t rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp echo, icy valve beads, and pulsing blue light are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain movement and mood. The valve wheel doubles as micro-setting, its cold weight guiding the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; only the hologram chamber edges toward generic steampunk without fresh sensory signature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the swallowed truth”—escalates from rumor to revelation via the valve’s turn, narrowing Elias’s options to witness or flee. The hologram’s confession tightens pressure; the cost is the unburdened knowledge he must now carry. No false reversals; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of human greed buried beneath ghost-story trappings emerges through the hologram’s testimony and Elias’s silent renunciation. Subtext is carried by the valve’s etched names and the “weight” he refuses to shoulder. Final image avoids moralizing, letting the empty tunnel mouth resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, atmospheric, and consistent in third-person close; sensory diction (“drowsy alertness,” “beads clicking”) reflects Elias’s wired fatigue. No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” territory) creeps in but stays within POV plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor scaffold: “the hum crescendoed. Lights flared” could compress further. No mixed metaphors or loops; clarity remains intact through the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “abandoned place with ghost” trope into a critique of industrial cover-up, grounded in the valve’s mechanical testimony. Specificity of the 1920s hologram and toxic-sludge memory freshens the premise. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
