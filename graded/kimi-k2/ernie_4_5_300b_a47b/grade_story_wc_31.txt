<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—duty to the lamps vs. the buried vow—are embodied in the brass key and the cold water; the final renunciation of the key on the desk earns the closure with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the embodied grief (“stain on his ears”) grounds the metaphysical quest. Micro-choice of placing the key crystallizes the arc without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s placement and the humming color of sound reweight Elias’s stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is held through the pattern of light and memory; the final image crystallizes options with felt cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pier, submerged ship, and lantern light constrain every move; the library’s dry interior against brine-soaked corridors charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—cold water, oil-shimmer spines—filtered through Elias’s lamplighter eye. Environment shapes tactics and recharges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the color of sound—tightens once when the library’s phrase reframes memory as audible hue. Escalation is accretive: each lantern, book, and key touch deepens the pattern until the final hum forecloses hiding. Cost is the relinquished key and the lifelong silence broken.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between spoken and unspoken vows; the color of sound becomes a non-literal answer to grief. No moralizing; the final whispered “I see you now” reweights prior motifs without thesis. Subtext in the key’s burn and the underwater cello hum carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is salt-bit and lantern-amber, with rhythmic control that tightens under pressure. Perceptual signature—“meteor hush,” “grotesque smiles”—remains consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final luminous swirl.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. The closing cadence—“a symphony only he could hear”—earns its resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken library as memory vault, the color of sound as grief’s hue—fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Risk in the metaphysical premise is fully committed to and paid off in the final reconfiguration. Specificity of the tarnished key and oil-shimmer spines anchors universals.</comment>
