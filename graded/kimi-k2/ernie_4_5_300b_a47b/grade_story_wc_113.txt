<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—rational skepticism vs. occult fascination—are embodied in trembling hands and the deliberate dip of the program; the final promise “I’ll finish it” is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (she is soaked, program lost). Interiority stays concrete, but a few stock phrases (“ghost stories whispered,” “chill down her spine”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (water, lanterns, symbols) thickens until the final Charged Poise reweights the stake. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—she memorizes the code at the price of the artifact itself. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flooded pit, floating cello bow, and flickering lanterns are not backdrop; the water literally reveals the code and steals the program, constraining her next move. Micro-setting (the soggy program) charges the final image. A few generic “cavernous halls” phrases prevent 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the ghost by decoding the symphony—tightens once when the water-damaged symbols crystallize into the opening bars. Cost is legible: loss of the program, soaked clothes, irreversible commitment. No false escalation; coincidence (broken pipe) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished art and liminal voices emerges through concrete particulars (floating sheet music, half-submerged timpani) rather than statement. Final whispered promise offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. A touch of sentimental “requiem for the unseen” keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and music-saturated—“unstruck chords,” “low notes vibrating through floodwaters”—with rhythmic control that mirrors rising tension. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct. Compression is purposeful; elision taught early (symbols “bleed through”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance both image and stakes. Only minor loop: “water seemed to hum… urging her to disrupt the stillness” borders on paraphrase. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house as séance-machine feels fresh; the water itself becomes co-author of the score. Ghost trope is transformed through Clara’s professional ear and tactile ritual. Specificity of timpanist’s stance in ankle-deep water anchors the uncanny. One of the stronger 600-word risks I’ve seen.</comment>
