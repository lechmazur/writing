<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—spectacles, coat, blotter petal—but the moment of handing Lira the vial lacks a visible cost or contradiction; his detachment stays flat rather than fracturing under pressure. The “professionally thorough” trait is shown early and late, yet never complicates the choice. Motivation is stated, not dramatized in conflict. Lira’s presence supplies pressure, but Elias’s stance is unchanged, yielding a credible but low-impact Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias shelves the used petal, the grotto’s hum subsides, and the half-truth business quietly reconfigures—cost is the perpetual readiness for the next client. Causal chain holds: dusk static → petal test → sale → reset. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of scent, light, and static builds to a final cadence shift rather than a causal reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto is rendered through Elias’s practiced attention—moss, suspended crystals, electromagnetic bloom—each detail filtering his craft. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting, handled twice and finally archived, charging the closing image. Sensory selection narrows under urgency (testing the vial) and widens in repose. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment constrains no choice, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s ethic of balanced half-truths—is signaled early and tightened when Lira’s request tests it; the trade-off (joy for sorrow) is named but not viscerally paid by Elias. One meaningful deepening: the petal’s faint residual scent marks the cost of another transaction. Agency remains Elias’s continual recommitment to the craft. Pressure is coherent but mild; no new option is foreclosed for him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of curated emotional truth emerges from Elias’s ritual and final archiving of the petal; no direct statement intrudes. Subtext lives in the silence after Lira leaves—the grotto’s hum as quiet indictment. The ending reweights the premise: each sale diminishes some unknown part of the dealer. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. No late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, faintly archaic, and consistent with Elias’s occupation—“counterfeit emotion dealer,” “violet spectacles,” “static charge of dusk’s first sigh.” Syntax modulates with emotional distance; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean. No register drift or filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; sentences advance image or motive. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional elevated diction (“subsume your sorrow”) fits Elias’s self-conception. Metaphors are coherent—amber grotto, static electricity—without muddle. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor scaffolding in “professionally thorough” repetition, not enough to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise of engineered emotional half-truths is fresh, grounded in sensory craft rather than abstract tech. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse without Elias’s specific occupation and setting. Tropes of memory-erasing elixir are subverted by the dealer’s ethical detachment. Specificity of orchid petal under electromagnetic dusk feels inevitable. Risk is moderate; no gimmickry.</comment>
