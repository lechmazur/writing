<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and scientific drive are palpable, but the interior contradiction between clinging and letting go is stated more than dramatized; the final choice to “feel the resonance” is earned yet abstract, lacking embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tape’s hum reframes “letting go” as transmission, not erasure. Causal chain (tape → tuning fork → snow-globe motor) holds, but the 12-second loop’s agency feels external rather than driven by Elara.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Salt-crusted spines, lantern light, and pressure-warped shelves create a tactile sunken library; the tuning fork and snow globe serve as micro-settings that constrain discovery. Yet spatial choreography is lightly sketched—no sense of moving through corridors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering persistence versus dissolution—tightens when the hum matches the globe. Pressure grows texturally, not causally; the cost is intellectual awe rather than a forfeited option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as quantum signal, grief as unresolved waveform. Final image of shaking the globe to “feel the resonance” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, scientist-poet, with restrained melancholy; perceptual signature favors frequencies and salt crystals. No dialogue, but free-indirect style stays consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional lyrical lifts (“time seemed to pool in the silence”) avoid overwriting. No loops or scaffold; minor filter verbs (“she noticed”) do not stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart lore, quantum decay, and grief physics; the snow-globe motor as 440 Hz transmitter feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky concept executed with disciplined specificity.</comment>
