<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for reconnection yet hoarding silence—drives every micro-choice; the glass ink well and manuscript act as embodied stakes. Her “carefully reckless” trait manifests in the midnight sprint to translate the sister-dialogue, costing her physical stamina and emotional armor. The final phone call crystallizes an earned shift: vulnerability chosen over retreat. Only slight over-articulation of “symphony of truth” keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each translation breakthrough (“because” of cross-referenced promise) tightens the emotional noose, culminating in the decisive call that reconfigures silence into invitation. Closure lands on-page with the felt cost of admitting past cowardice. One minor causality hiccup—Henrik’s sudden key gift feels slightly convenient—caps the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive’s dust, mothball scent, and sagging shelves are filtered through Elara’s obsessive focus, constraining her movements and pacing. The glass ink well’s runic glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image as she packs it to share with Mira. Selective sensory detail (lace-faded script, etiolated parchment) mirrors the fragility of trust. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust before the wedding—intensifies with each translated promise; the sister-manuscript tightens the emotional vise. The final phone call is a visible price: surrendering scholarly detachment for raw vulnerability. Escalation is causal and linear; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-as-language emerges organically from Elara’s translations; the final line “our hearts speak in the language of belonging” reweights prior silences without moralizing. Subtext in the love-letter—“do not dam it with silence”—echoes her own dammed river. Avoids tidy moral by leaving reconciliation outcome uncertain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ink-stained fingers, labyrinthine mind, selective attention to etymology over people. Syntax tightens under pressure—shorter clauses as dawn approaches. Henrik’s gravel voice and Elara’s trembling reply carry subtext; dialogue sparse but purposeful. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined; “lace-faded script” and “mothball-scented vault” do double duty. Occasional elevated diction (“symphonies of truth”) slightly drifts from Elara’s lexicon but is earned by her academic register. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward the phone call. One mixed metaphor—“river finally unblocked”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct languages as living trust scores, translation as reconciliation ritual. The glass ink well’s runic glow transforms from relic to bridge. Avoids cliché by grounding linguistic magic in archival grunt work. Specificity of Old Brythonic and mead recipes anchors the fantastical premise.</comment>
