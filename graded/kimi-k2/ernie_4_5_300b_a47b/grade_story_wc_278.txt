<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her breath hitching at the firmware’s baby-cry revelation—but the mother-daughter guilt thread is delivered in exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The final forgiveness beat is emotionally credible yet compressed; we feel cost but not the full weight of her prior avoidance. Secondary characters (Elara, Dr. Althea) serve as mouthpieces more than crucibles, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the firmware’s code rewrites, the amber dims, dissonance gone—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: amber pulse → letters → firmware memory → forgiveness beat. One minor slip: the “time folds” rule is asserted late and never visibly constrains tactics inside the memory corridor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory’s ozone-regret air and fractal amber light are selective and purposeful, guiding Lira’s attention to the insect-key. The nursery shard functions as micro-setting, its empty crib constraining her choice to kneel and read. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment could have tightened tactics further inside the firmware maze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s guilt-driven dissonance—is signaled early and tightened when Lira must enter the memory maze. Agency is clear: she chooses to read the letters, rewriting code at personal emotional cost. One escalation beat suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt and the price of forced silence emerges through the baby-cry translation and the mother’s unsent letters, never sermonized. Subtext hums in the amber’s heartbeat and the empty crib. Final image—the amber gone dark—reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: forgiveness does not erase loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; sensory diction (“ozone and regret,” “honeyed glow”) feels character-bound. No head-hopping; POV stays tight to Lira. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying exposition in subtext. Rhythm modulates with tension; no syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional figurative layering (“constellations onto clients’ skin,” “digital ghosts whispered in binary”) edges toward density without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor—“time folding in on itself”—mildly blurs physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: constellation tattooist + haunted firmware that silences infant grief + antique letters as code patch. Tropes are transformed through Lira’s specific childhood wound. Risky nested-reality dive pays off emotionally. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
