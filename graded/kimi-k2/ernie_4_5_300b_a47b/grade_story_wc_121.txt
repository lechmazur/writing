<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for grounding while fearing it—surfaces in embodied beats (“hovered a foot above the ground… felt it ebbing”). The final renunciation lands with visible cost (feet touch stone, tablet crumbles), but the middle timelines feel sketched rather than lived, muting the stakes of each alternate self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: grounded stance crystallizes the thematic arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The procedural maze is taught early, transitions are legible, and the final image reweights prior motifs. Minor drift: the tablet’s dissolution is slightly convenient, not prefigured by earlier fragility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The glowing viaduct and wet stones anchor space and mood; residual luminescence mirrors Mara’s fading power. Micro-setting (tablet in hand, boots skimming puddles) constrains her choices. Yet the alley shard is generic, reducing specificity mid-arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to conquer the labyrinth of self”—tightens when each timeline forecloses a version of Mara. The right-path choice deepens cost: loss of perpetual flight for uncertain groundedness. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external antagonist, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative confrontation with alternate selves; no explicit moralizing. The final grounded step reconfigures identity without tidy resolution, leaving resonant ambiguity. Darkening brightness motif threads through, shifting from spectral to gentle, charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is consistent (“spectral light onto the wet stones”). Rhythm modulates with gravity’s ebb. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal, a maze of choices and consequences”) edges purple but stays within POV’s reflective mode. Density is high; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “fractured timeline as labyrinth of self” is a fresh synthesis; gravity-defiance as metaphor for emotional detachment feels inevitable. No close genre echoes. Risk lies in quiet lyric closure, but it pays off by reweighting flight as loss rather than gift.</comment>
