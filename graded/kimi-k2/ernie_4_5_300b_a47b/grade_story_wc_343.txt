<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is clear and embodied, but the interior contradiction is thin; her leap feels sudden because the stakes between personal risk and discovery aren’t dramatized in scene. Jax offers minimal relational pressure. The earned cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: hopscotch → coordinates → portal → leap. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (knowledge of “truth”), but the price is more stated than shown. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Airship hull, cargo hold, and starling murmurations are vivid and selective, anchoring time and place. The hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains choice. Final tunnel image recharges earlier star-field motif, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is signaled early and tightened when the portal appears. Escalation is driven by Lira’s deciphering and leap; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly blunting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity as both compass and peril emerges through action and image, not statement. Final orb vision reweights earlier mapping obsession with implicit cost. Avoids tidy moral, but resonance is moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Lira’s map-maker perception. Syntax modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Dialogue with Jax carries subtext and distinguishes idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“liquid darkness,” “stranded luminance”) flirts with overwriting but stays within voice. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Hopscotch-board-as-map and starling-guided portal feel fresh; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Synthesis is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent.</comment>
