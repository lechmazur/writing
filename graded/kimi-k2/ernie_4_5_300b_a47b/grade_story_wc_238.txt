<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “reading Braille” on scores, the bottle’s weight “as if the dove’s wings carried the weight of something unspoken.” Elias’s guilt is embodied in his “eyes two bruises.” The final choice to finish the song imperfectly is earned by prior guilt and Clara’s pressure, but the sister’s voice remains more device than person, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing drop, the voice, the chainsaws restarting crystallize a before/after of guilt transmuted into imperfect release. Causal chain holds—bottle as conductor, music as current, apology as circuit completion. One minor ellipsis: how the drop’s glow bridges to audible voice is elided, but the metaphoric current sustains legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive dust “smelled of regret,” piano keys “yellowed with age,” chainsaws waiting “as if for a signal”—selective sensory triangulation anchors mood and stakes. The orchard outside functions as looming deadline, but the archive itself does not physically constrain choices beyond atmosphere; hence capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to expiate guilt via musical apology—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown of chainsaws. The single decisive intensification (drop, glow, voice) forces the choice to finish the song. Cost is felt in the empty bottle and resumed cutting, though the sister’s absence remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically from copper-dove conductor and unfinished sonata; no explicit moralizing. The final image—empty bottle, roaring saws—reweights the premise: absolution is partial, ongoing, external. Subtext in Clara’s “imperfect miracles require imperfect methods” is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clara’s perceptual signature—“regret was her currency,” “dust smelled of regret”—is consistent and textured. Dialogue carries subtext (“You advised through metaphors”). Rhythm modulates with tension: longer sentences in reflection, clipped exchanges under pressure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical—“the hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down” sets tone in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“prismatic shards”) fits Clara’s arch sensibility. One mixed metaphor—“vibration is energy. Energy can be channeled”—slightly dilutes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” is fresh, and the copper-dove perfume bottle as electrical conduit for musical séance is an unexpected, specific synthesis. The orchard-as-countdown externalizes internal stakes without cliché. Risky compression holds; no derivative echoes.</comment>
