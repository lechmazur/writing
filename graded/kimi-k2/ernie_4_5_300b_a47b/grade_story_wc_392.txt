<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mara's traits are specific—she adjusts her belt, grips the lantern, steadies her breathing—but interior contradiction is summarized ("she’d been a fool") rather than dramatized; micro-choices (lighting the lantern, reading the files) are causal, yet final renunciation feels asserted rather than cost-drenched on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The closure—Mara’s decision to expose Cole using empirical evidence—lands as an earned pivot, visible cost framed by the shuddering train overhead and gut-level refusal; lens is hybrid (situational crystallization plus causal knowledge gain). Orientation anchors by 100 words without debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s damp walls and metallic stink are vivid and constrain her breathing and footing; the lantern’s evolving gleam across brass etchings and glass case directly shapes her shifting perception and final stance, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (freeing herself from Cole’s control) is signaled early; a single but decisive escalation occurs when the files reveal “Eliminate” and the vision exposes Cole’s manipulation. The cost is a foreclosed trust path; no reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of manipulated memory as control emerges through concrete events and charged objects, not exposition. The lantern’s historic echoes reweight the present betrayal without an explicit moral; resonance is felt and open-ended.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and controlled; sensory verbs (“hummed,” “slick,” “stagnant”) filter through Mara’s professional POV. Compression of time and thought is clean; interior voice reads as hers without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry high density and vary in rhythm; moment-specific nouns (“rusted ladder,” “corroded hinges”) avoid catalog description. A few near-paraphrases (“watchfully calm… watchfully calm”) add minor loop drag at closure but do not obscure the image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Merging a 19th-century abolitionist artifact with present-day infrastructure sabotage feels freshly synthesized; memory-as-weapon angle avoids familiar tropes by grounding power struggle in tactile subway grit and bureaucratic murder files.</comment>
