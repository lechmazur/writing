<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael/Marcus carries contradiction vividly—living man walking with his own death certificate—but interiority tilts toward exposition of synesthesia rather than embodied cost; no interior contradiction visible at the instant of recognition by the skeleton. Final stasis feels declared, not paid through micro-choices; cost named (“He would make them remember”) rather than shown in this beat. Compelling but short of earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly Resonant Reconfiguration—the locket photo renames the protagonist and redraws prior fragments as clues. Causal linkage remains accumulative: fragments stitched into story after event rather than because/therefore propelling action earlier. One meaningful tightening achieved when past is reclaimed, but pressure is atmospheric rather than driven by choice narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is tactile—“rust flaking, diesel stink”—and tide rhythm supplies ticking stakes. Setting constrains bodily movement but doesn’t bend final choice; locket reweighted, not container or tide. Sensory selection sharp, place felt, yet environment remains backdrop rather than active shaper of ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity—signaled early; escalation delivered in single revelation laced with conceptual cost (living ghost). Agency limited, discovery accrued rather than tactics altered under pressure. One deepening effective, tide clock used atmospherically not mechanically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Memory as palimpsest emerges from fragment-collecting conceit; theme stays implicit until locket reweights earlier “talisman” label to actual self. Avoids overt moralizing, resonance leans cerebral over visceral. Subtext operates strongly; yet final sentence (“make them remember”) edges toward direct articulation, diluting poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Narration possesses moody, synesthetic texture—“violet of regret”—tight focalization held. Sentence rhythm modulates smoothly; occasional filter slips (“colors bled into hues he saw”) keep distance minimal. Dialogue sparse, voices distinct from narrative diction. Voice specificity clear, texture consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose lean, varied rhythm, concrete verbs—no scaffold loops. Metaphorical language compressed to effective bursts; one line mis-step (“tidal wave” of realization) cliché but minor artifact. Clarity high, no paraphrase loops. No issues dilute closure clarity.</comment>

<comment>Identity-as-mosaic via container archaeology freshens familiar amnesia trope; sensory synesthesia device specific to this voice. Accumulation pattern works retrospectively rather than predictive twist. Risk-taking limited but effective. Derivative seed transformed through concrete particulars.</comment>
