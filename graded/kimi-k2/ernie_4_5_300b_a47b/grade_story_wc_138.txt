<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s boredom is embodied early and flips to fear when the amulet reacts, but interiority leans on stock phrases (“mind that withered from boredom”). The final choice to release the amulet is foreshadowed yet feels slightly abrupt; cost is present but abstract (“fell through”). Lira’s arrival supplies relational pressure, but her dialogue is expository rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amulets shatter and the escondite collapses, reweighting eternity into possibility. Causal chain (storm → field disruption → release) is legible; one transition from corridor to sideways-gravity chamber is clean. Orientation is established by ~110 words. Cost is felt in the void, though slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is rendered with kinetic specificity—walls bleed crimson, gravity pulls sideways—and the amulet fragment itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the escape. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (ozone, iron). Final collapse image recharges the “fractured rainbow” motif. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape eternal stasis—is signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: storm weakens amulets, forcing the joint renunciation. Agency is shared, but Kael’s micro-choice to press fragments together carries visible cost (loss of immortality anchor). Pressure remains coherent under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of choosing uncertainty over endless repetition emerges through action, not statement. Subtext lives in the mirrors’ alternate Kael, a silent indictment of staying. Final void image offers non-literal answer: “symphony of possibilities.” Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Could sharpen thematic counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric, slightly ornate but consistent with immortal POV. Compression (“hushed thunder”) is taught early and recurs. Free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue from Lira is functional but less textured; still, voices remain distinct. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, occasionally lush yet propulsive. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“walls bled crimson”) serve moment. Minor register drift toward poetic diction in peak beats but does not obscure. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension. One typo: “dimensionally aware senses” could tighten to “dimensional sense.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: immortal ennui + dimensional prison + solar storm as liberation engine. Tropes are inverted—escape is not conquest but surrender. Specificity of the escondite’s shifting geometry and the amulet’s emotional charge prevents generic feel. Risk taken in abstract ending pays off.</comment>
