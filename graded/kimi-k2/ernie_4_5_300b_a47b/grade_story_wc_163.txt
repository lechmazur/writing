<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her eyes reflecting the dance of light”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the burnt feather is handled twice yet never forces a hard choice, so the final “rhythm of belonging” feels more observed than earned. No genuine flaw complicates her stance, and the cost is diffuse rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s realization that belonging is a journey, not a destination—charged by the shared exhale and the fading bioluminescence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies, then subsides, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater dome, algae-choked corridors, and bioluminescent flora are rendered with selective sensory detail that filters through Mara’s professional gaze. The burnt feather functions as micro-setting object, constraining her final gesture and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened once via the alignment’s crescendo, but the cost is collective awe rather than a personal trade-off. Agency is observational; no option is foreclosed for Mara herself. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from the interplay of sea and sky, past and present. The burnt feather’s reprise reweights the motif of endurance without moralizing. Final image of “shadowseam wonder” offers resonant ambiguity, though the epiphany edges close to articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”—anchors a lyrical, controlled voice. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop (“the city returned to its usual, subdued glow” / “the city waited, patient and enduring”) costs −0.2. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of astrocartography beneath the sea; the burnt feather as sky-relic is specific and non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, but coherence never wavers. Avoids familiar templates.</comment>
