<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief for his erased wife is vivid and embodied in the pressed flowers, but interiority drifts toward summary (“memories he’d lost years ago”). The final choice to guide others is declared rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance shifts from fear to stewardship, charged by the rose-key. Causal chain is clear (coffee pattern → panel → rose), yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Salt crystals and gravity pockets are tactile, selective, and guide movement; the chamber’s weight fluctuations physically constrain Elias’s steps. Final image of “gleaming silence” recharges the setting as sanctuary, not just backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled early and tightened when the rose floods Elias with foreign memories. The deepening is driven by his agency (touching the rose), but the price is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s persistence emerges organically from salt’s preservative nature and the rose’s function. Final image reframes loss as communal responsibility, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the flowers’ silence is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric, with rhythmic control (“gleaming silence,” “gravity pockets pulsed”). Occasional elevated diction (“exhuming these lost fragments”) slightly drifts from Elias’s laborer diction but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only minor loops (“salt crystals grew… salt crystals”). Metaphors are precise; no overwriting under pressure. Final paragraph’s cadence earns its quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines maritime grief, memory physics, and salt-crystal archive into a fresh synthesis. The whale carcass and gravity pockets feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk lies in quiet closure, but it pays off.</comment>
