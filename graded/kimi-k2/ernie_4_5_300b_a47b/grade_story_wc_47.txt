<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—clinging to guilt versus grafting new life—are dramatized in the pendant moment; the final choice to plant the sapling with Elias is earned and visibly costs her isolation. Interiority is concrete, but the “quietly proactive” label for Elias is asserted rather than embodied. Relationship pressure is present but mild; status shift is legible yet understated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s re-setting and the sapling planting crystallize a new stance with felt cost—the brother’s memory is no longer a private shrine. Causal linkage is clean; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moss-lit server racks, drip-pattern floor, and amber pendant are tactile and selective; each constrains choices (pendant must be opened, floor pattern guides stone placement). Spatial choreography is coherent; weather and decay affect mood and action. Final image of glowing moss and swinging pendant recharges the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Lila will release her guilt into shared tending—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the offer to graft moss into the pendant forces a visible trade-off. Cost is legible: she relinquishes sole guardianship of the memory. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-integration emerges from concrete actions (grafting, planting) rather than statement. Subtext in Elias’s orchid placement and Lila’s laugh carries the emotional shift. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about future growth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to Lila’s sensory filter; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature in noticing drip rhythms and moss glow. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“honeyed hush,” “fossilized resin”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. Sentence variety supports rhythm; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-digital ruin and living graft; the server-moss garden feels inevitable. Pendant-plus-moss image is non-obvious yet grounded. Tropes of grief-gardening are transformed through specific tech relics. Risky quiet ending pays off.</comment>
