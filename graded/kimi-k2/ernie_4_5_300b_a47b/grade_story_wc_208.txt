<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—turning chaos into legible language—remains consistent, and her shift from sculptor to “weaver of timelines” is earned through the lantern-slide covenant. Interiority is vivid (“turbine-hum reverie that vibrated in her bones”), yet the cost of her new role is only implied, not embodied on the page. The grandmother’s single line of dialogue supplies relational pressure, but the relationship itself is sketched rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly: Lira steps back through the archway with re-imagined purpose, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her art as “maps” of time. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each slide image layers stakes until the final crystallization. The Orientation Test is met within the first 120 words, and the single transition through the portal is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is not mere backdrop; its keystone hums and becomes the literal hinge of time, constraining Lira’s passage and charging the final image. Driftwood sculptures double as micro-settings—each knot a year—so the object-as-setting rule is satisfied. Sensory detail is selective (“salt and iron” taste of the phrase) and filtered through sculptor’s priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decipher the island’s history or remain lost—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern slide reveals ancestral covenants. The single deepening beat (portal crossing) narrows Lira’s options from observer to guardian. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price of guardianship is felt but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as craft, complexity scaffolded by simplicity. The final image of kelp-hair timelines and clockwork hearts reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the grandmother’s “You’re late” carries generational urgency without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured and sculptor-specific: “coaxing stories from flotsam,” “turbine-hum reverie.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but idiosyncratic (“Teach me”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor filter-verb clusters (“she saw herself in a hundred different lives”). No loops or scaffold in peak beats. Metaphors stay coherent; “kelp hair wasn’t just decoration—it was a timeline” is precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of driftwood art and time-weaving feels fresh; the lantern-slide covenant transforms a familiar portal trope into generational stewardship. Specificity (“crab with a clockwork heart”) anchors the concept. Risk in lyric time-shifts is controlled and legible.</comment>
