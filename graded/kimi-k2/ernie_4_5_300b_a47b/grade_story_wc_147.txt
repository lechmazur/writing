<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—smash vs. wait—are dramatized in the rusted stopper beat; her renunciation of trapping memories carries visible cost in the empty vial. Interiority is embodied (fogged glass, salt-sting lungs) and character-specific. The final choice to release rather than hoard is earned by prior causality and forecloses her original goal with felt loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush shatters into voices, then resolves into a single clear note—Mara’s stance crystallizes with the cost of relinquishing the temple’s archive. Causal linkage holds: scent triggers memory → memory reveals purpose → release dissolves prison. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The temple’s sound-trapping architecture and bioluminescent dome constrain every move; the crumbling archway and fissured floor physically limit Mara’s path. Micro-setting (crystal vial) doubles as tool and memory-key, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—salt-sting, algae-slick stone—filtered through Mara’s urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral—is signaled early and tightened when the hush’s prison nature is revealed. One meaningful turn: Mara overrides her instinct to flee, choosing release under rising storm pressure. Cost is legible in the empty vial and dissolved voices. Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as burden vs. gift, silence as weapon vs. prison. Subtext in the vial’s warmth and the priests’ terror avoids moralizing. Final image of empty, radiant vial reweights the premise without stating a moral. Complexity lingers—release is both loss and liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s synesthetic noticing (scent as light, hush as mirror) and rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during breach, longer lyric pulses in reflection. Voice remains coherent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “algae-slick stone,” “woven seaweed robes” do double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is purposeful—hush as eel-coiled prison—without overwriting. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater memory-vault guarded by engineered silence, unlocked by scent. Tropes (lost temple, relic) are transformed through sensory specificity and ethical inversion—archive as prison. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
