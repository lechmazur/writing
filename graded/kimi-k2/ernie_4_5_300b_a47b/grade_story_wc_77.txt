<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. resolve—are embodied in the tightening of the clasp and the copper taste of the lie; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (seared palm, golden pulse). Vey’s pressure is present but too cryptic to register as a second crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“tell the shadow you welcome it”) narrows options until the cloak’s flare dissolves the threat. Closure lands as Decisive Change—shadow gone, clasp re-lit—cost seared into flesh. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Funhouse mirrors, condensation, and ozone scent are selective and POV-filtered; the cloak itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. One spatial glitch—Vey’s face “obscured by dim light” after Mara turns toward him—drops it from 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is tested in one tightening beat: the paradoxical welcome. Cost is seared skin and the cloak’s irreversible shift from faint glow to steady gold. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of fear-as-lie emerges through embodied paradox rather than statement; final image of Vey’s cold smile reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in “the one that survives” lands as chilling implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, tactile (“copper taste,” “jagged shadows”), and consistent under stress. Compression is purposeful; no head-hop. Dialogue from Vey is spare and subtext-laden, distinct from Mara’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; only minor loop—“shadow recoiled… shadow wailed”—slips in. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms the carnival-horror trope into a metaphysical duel via paradox and inherited relic; the cloak’s shift from heirloom to weapon feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric compression pays off.</comment>
