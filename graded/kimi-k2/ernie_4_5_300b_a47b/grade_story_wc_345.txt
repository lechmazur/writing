<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism is consistent but abstract; her interiority is filtered through exposition rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a flaw or hidden motive, so the final stance feels pre-ordained. The settlers’ shift from skepticism to unity is summarized rather than dramatized through relationship crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch holds, the nebula flares, the bell tolls—collective effort crystallized. Causality is thematic rather than procedural; the chalked messages serve as lyrical catalysts rather than plot mechanics. One tightening beat—the settlers gathering—suffices under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and pearl-fruited groves are sketched with selective, luminous detail. The butterfly bell functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s intangible agency and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the orchard’s scale never overwhelms the intimate stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the arches to preserve the nebula—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the settlers must act before twilight. The cost is collective labor rather than personal loss; the price feels shared, diffused, and thus less acute on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal hope emerges through image and action, not statement. The nebula’s promise is reweighted by the final golden bath, offering a non-literal answer to despair. Subtext resides in the bell’s chime and the chalk’s fading script, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient voice maintains lyrical distance, consistent with a ghost’s perspective. Syntax modulates between hushed exposition and incantatory cadence. No dialogue appears; the absence is apt for a story of whispers and chalk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich without purple overload. Occasional soft phrases (“shimmer in the air,” “fragile balance”) edge toward cliché but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ghost caretaker, floating orchard, and celestial nebula feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes are grounded in sensory specificity rather than ornament. The risk of lyrical abstraction is balanced by concrete stakes and collective action.</comment>
