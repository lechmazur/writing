<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Yorick’s quiet precision and Lira’s desperate search fuse in embodied, tactile emotion—thumb on bonsai bark, fingers tightening on compass. Both reveal interior contradictions (patience vs haste, blame vs longing) that escalate to the final reprise; their reconciliation carries visibly felt cost in the translucent father and the shimmering lace no longer needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Situational lens: coherent pressure forces Lira’s stance crystallization. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis where reunion dissolves but inner forgiveness locks in, visible cost in the vanishing ship and sea returned to calm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-rain islet air, compass etched like antique linen, and the bonsai studio’s wooden planks are selective, concretely sensed. Setting steers choice—the constrained rowboat route shaped by tide memory—and charges final image with salt-bruised cerulean sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—tightens through escalating risk (compass locking, father’s ghost materializing) with visible cost: Lira must release the lace to him, the price paid at climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: remembrance as living tide, apology as color only visible in surrender. Final image reweights prior grief without moralizing—sea reflecting scrubbed sky, lace now relic of letting go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Lyrical, slow-spoken cadence in third-limited glides between Yorick’s deliberate rhythm and Lira’s frayed urgency. Perceptual signatures vivid: “drip of melting snow” vs “voice frayed,” no head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with deliberate cadence matching Yorick’s patience; no looped phrasing. Figurative language selective—lace “like antique linen”—and never muddles clarity. High density achieved through image-driven advance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Use of lace-as-code and tides-of-remembrance feels freshly woven; familiar ghost-reunion trope transformed through craft of thread and compass. Risky lyric pacing paid off in charged final image that could not exist at any other cadence.</comment>
