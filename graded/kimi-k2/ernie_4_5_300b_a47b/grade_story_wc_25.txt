<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s fear-versus-curiosity contradiction is embodied in trembling hands and the coin’s burn; his whisper-theory motive is dramatized through the tactical silence that wins the challenge. The final refusal to shout directions crystallizes an earned stance with visible social cost. Yet interiority occasionally drifts into thematic summary (“whispers travel farther than shouts”) rather than moment-to-moment sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s whispered credo reweights the labyrinth’s rule-set while the glowing maps confirm the maze’s sentience. Causal chain—coin warmth → Libra symbol → key click → staircase → dawn return—holds under a Causal lens. One minor ellipsis: how the key’s brass fits a nonexistent lock is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm’s ozone taste and vibrating steel constrain every move; the container stairwell functions as micro-setting that enables the climax. Spatial anchors (Row Gamma, 42-B) are crisp and track cleanly. The zodiac coin’s tactile heat and the Libra glyph etched on steel charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the whisper theory—is signaled early and tightened when Elias chooses silence over rescue shouts, paying the social cost of withheld aid. Pressure escalates because the storm and shifting containers narrow tactical options; coincidence (Libra symbol) complicates rather than resolves. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus broadcasting emerges through action (silent steps, withheld shout) rather than statement. The coin’s constellations and glowing maps reprise earlier motifs to reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Subtext in Voss’s grumble and Elias’s grin carries the power shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory filter; tremor, taste, warmth anchor perception. Syntax tightens under pressure—“He pressed the key against the symbol. A click.”—then relaxes into the dawn hush. No head-hopping; Voss’s speech is filtered through Elias’s amused stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence advances position or atmosphere. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in reflective beats, not under peak stress. No loops or mixed metaphors; the single simile “edges sharp as knife cuts” is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sentient shipping-container labyrinth keyed to gait and whisper is a fresh synthesis of mythic maze and logistical noir. The zodiac coin as both talisman and cipher transforms a familiar fantasy object into a constraint-driven tool. Risk-taking in the nonviolent, atmospheric climax heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
