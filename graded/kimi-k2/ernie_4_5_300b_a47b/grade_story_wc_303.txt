<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling coffee pour, the mulberry ache—yet her final choice to “dismantle the dream” feels less an earned consequence than a lyrical surrender; the psychic plant link and violin history stay ornamental rather than shaping tactics. No rival character appears; relationships-as-crucible is therefore moot. Contradictory impulses are stated but not staged in real time; the decision registers as abstraction rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “propagate” and recurring violet glow reweights stakes until Lira chooses renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (stardust stasis); the cost—“only the ache remained”—is legible on the page. Drive holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear at 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Velvet observatory,” “coffee-stained hands,” and melting violin shards give tactile, selective grounding. The observatory and plants constrain Lira’s movements and charge the stardust image. Economy of detail works; no credibility break.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream of usurpation versus empire—is signaled early and tightens into final abandonment; the violet violin rupture is the decisive deepening under Accumulative lens. No coincidences solve; choice costs her future path. Agency is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “how histories fracture futures” unfolds through Lira’s choice without sermon; the stardust ending reweights the violin’s lullaby without restating it. Ambiguity lingers cleanly.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured narration maintains consistent third-person close focus; no POV drifts. “Mulberry ache” and “porcelain galaxy” are sharp, idiosyncratic. Compression and non-standard cadence are purposeful and legible at closure under lyric design.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and line-level momentum propels; minor loops (“whispered warnings…leaves curling like fists”) and stacked modifiers are contained. Final image lands clear.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>A provenance researcher hearing violin futures in coffee stains is fresh; perforated destiny and telepathic plants avoid cliché by their tonal integration. Final stardust shatter is a non-obvious payoff.</question>
