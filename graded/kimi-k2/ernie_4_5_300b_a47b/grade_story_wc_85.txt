<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt is embodied in the trembling watch-hand and tactile driftwood search; the final resolve to break silence is earned by prior visions. Interior contradiction—career liar choosing truth—plays in real time. Cost is felt: “some truths were too heavy to carry alone.” Minor slip: “guilt that pulsed beneath his ribs” edges toward diagnostic label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias renounces false-memory craft, accepting the cost of disclosure. Causal chain—driftwood visions → knowledge → decision—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the watch-hand stops trembling when the choice is made.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace, salt air, and cedar driftwood are vivid and selective; the ocean as archive of erased lives is fresh. Micro-setting (driftwood carvings) constrains the method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather subtly mirrors internal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or expose a family erasure—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each driftwood fragment; the final choice forecloses the lucrative lie trade. Cost is visible: Elias risks client trust and professional identity. No coincidence resolves the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as violence emerges from the carved word “Silence” and the erased brother; no overt moralizing. Subtext operates in withheld names and unsent letters. Final image—breaking the sieved hush—reweights all prior driftwood graves without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, maritime, and guilt-soaked: “the air tasted of salt and secrets.” Perceptual signature is consistent; driftwood details filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“guilt…like barnacles”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports tension. One mixed metaphor—“noose around his neck” beside “drowning in the sound”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: black-market memory erasure meets oceanic archive of driftwood confessions. Premise is specific, not template. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off: the final image reconfigures meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without Elias’s exact occupation and method.</comment>
