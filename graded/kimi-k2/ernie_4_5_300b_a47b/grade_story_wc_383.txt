<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—archiving pain vs. repurposing it—are dramatized in the shell-circle ritual; the embodied cost (sparks burning skin) earns her shift from isolation to independence. Interiority is specific, but “tragically radiant” remains more label than lived constraint until the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shell added thickens the pattern until the cadence shift (roses to ash) crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—constellations of light replacing quarantined ghosts—though the resonance mechanics could be causally sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The velvet garden’s paradoxical textures (soft petals, sharp thorns, ink-shadows) are filtered through Lirael’s bias and collapse into skeletal stems that charge the final image. Micro-setting (shell halves in dirt) constrains the ritual; spatial anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when the resonance flares force a choice: hoard or release memories. One decisive intensification suffices; the ash roses mark visible price. Agency drives the turn, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing pain emerges organically from the shell-archive ritual; the final image (shell as promise, not prison) reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the mother’s lavender regret lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“petals as soft as mourning veils” teaches the garden’s paradox early. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Free-indirect style stays coherent; diction never drifts from Lirael’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in low-pressure beats and clears for the ritual climax. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“sibilant hiss”) fits the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-liberation arc is refreshed by the resonance-archive conceit and the garden’s living paradox. Specificity of the shell halves and ash roses anchors universals; risk in lyric compression pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
