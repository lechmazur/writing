<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is embodied and specific—raw hands, salt-stung throat—but the ethical-diligence trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the rake-handle discovery is the single moment where a prior choice (to listen) pays off, giving us a credible micro-turn. The felt cost is present but diffuse—more atmospheric than bodily—so the renunciation/continuation lands just shy of 8+ intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each obsidian shard, each swing-stall, layers pressure until the rake-handle inscription crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pendulum resumes, the ridge reseals, and the cost is the searing reverie Lirael endures—visible on the page. One transition (ridge → tower) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but active antagonist—its cracks guide Lirael’s climb, its hum vibrates her bones, its sealing is the final image. Micro-setting (rake handle, salt-slick rungs) constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: what she must feel to restart the swing is exactly what we feel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restart the pendulum before the ridge cracks the village—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each obsidian groan. The single meaningful intensification is the Hush deepening until Lirael’s whispered inscription becomes the only remaining tactic; the cost is the searing reverie that leaves her hands raw and vision clouded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Incremental absolution” emerges organically from the rake’s inscription and the pendulum’s slow arc; no character moralizes. The final image—the ridge sealing “smooth as glass”—reweights the premise: balance is not stasis but continuous, painful correction. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, salt-bitter, and rhythmically controlled: short clauses under pressure, longer breaths at dusk. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lirael notices what a winder must: gear-thirst, rune-scars, tide-pulse. No head-hop; free-indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional lyric heightening (“creature of stone and salt”) risks overwriting but is balanced by grounded verbs—“crunching,” “licking.” No loops or scaffold; the final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The clock-tower-as-tide-regulator is a fresh synthesis of myth and mechanism; the broken rake handle as message-carrier feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric compression pays off: the world’s heartbeat is literally a pendulum, and the cost of restarting it is a private searing. No derivative echoes.</comment>
