<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority deepens steadily; her grief, resolve, and ethical calculus crystallize in the final release without cliché. Still, secondary characters are absent, and the pass-the-light gesture reads almost too neat; the flaw is minor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tight causal spine: Elara captures memory, polishes grief, weighs cost, and relinquishes light in exact sequence. The final star-wink lands as resonant reconfiguration, earned and legible under situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lichens, black water, mist, and constellation-runed jar anchor every sensory beat—never wallpaper. Micro-choice of stone anvil and rune-hum directly constrain polishing; setting shapes outcome without ornate excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—share untouched starlight under fire-ban—drives each beat. Escalation narrows: collect light → weigh cost → release with visible forfeiture, not coincidence. One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared stillness versus consuming fire emerges through sensory and ethical collisions, ending with conceptual repricing. A touch poetic overreach (“zephyr bloom”) tamps final punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise—selective noticing of galaxy-swirl in black water, distinct diction, no head-hopping. Lyric compression is patterned and paid off in the star-wink closure without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose balances poetic texture with propulsion; no loops, no purple. Occasional elevated diction (e.g., “siphon and polish its essence”) slightly overshoots POV, mildly dulled by stock “humming runes”.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar alchemy-trope into grief ritual anchored in sea glass memory. Specificity of meteorite tool and constellation jar refresh the frame; final star-wink feels both inevitable and new afterimage.</comment>
