<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnished sorrow,” “sharp as regret”), but the shift from revolutionary to archaeologist is asserted rather than dramatized; the shard’s warmth and glow anchor micro-choices, yet the Council remains a faceless backdrop, so status pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shard reweighted from relic of glory to map of crimes, fungi blooming as undeniable CR with conceptual cost; causal chain (cover mirrors → stabilize storm → expose truth) holds under Causal lens; one transition (storm night → dawn) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The baroque asteroid’s spires and cobalt haze are selective and purposeful; the fungi’s bioluminescent symbols physically charge the final image, constraining the Council’s narrative and Kael’s tactics; spatial choreography remains coherent across the atrium and garden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove Luminari fraud—tightens when Kael’s mirror-covering gambit forces a public test; escalation is driven by his agency (planting fungi, draping mirrors) with visible cost (heretic label); the storm’s temporal rips complicate but do not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as contested territory, mirrors as distorting lenses; the shard’s reprise and fungal glyphs reweight “civilization” from spires to symbiosis without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—revolution deferred but doubt planted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature (“poetically inclined” diction, synesthetic light); no head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure (“howling maelstrom of cobalt and violet”) heightens urgency without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold; figurative language (“time had only recently become visible”) is taught early and paid off; minor register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is negligible and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal storms as archaeological strata, mirror-draping as insurgent poetics; the bioluminescent fungi rewrite the Luminari myth from within; risk-taking (covering mirrors) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
