<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (tracing cracks, humming geometry). Motivation is clear and intensifies: from recording birds to risking oblivion. The final renunciation (“I am the extinction”) earns the cost of surrendering the diamond. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” is label-only, never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building of bird rhythms → diamond resonance → rune ignition → echo backlash. Closure is Earned Stasis: hurling the diamond forecloses translation, cost seared palm and permanent silence. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, copper skin, twin moons, and canyon throat are vivid, selective, and constrain every move (narrow ledge, slick bone). The diamond’s black vein and the birds’ fractal shadows charge the final image. Micro-setting (her palm) literally burns with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate texture into sound—tightens when the diamond’s song risks drowning her. One decisive intensification: birds freeze, runes ignite, echoes roar back. Cost is searing flesh and permanent silence. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the act: language as resonance versus oblivion. Subtext in the mirror-curse and the laugh “I am the extinction.” Final image of lingering song offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “geometry of vibrations,” “ink spilled on parchment.” Perceptual signature—she notices wingbeats like falling stars—remains consistent. Compression taught early (“fractured into a thousand overlapping voices”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances texture or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (molten ore, skeletal fingers). Rhythm accelerates with the echo maelstrom. Minor elevated diction (“prismatic shards”) fits the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: linguist-alchemist translating extinction into resonance via bird-flight calculus. Diamond as mirror-curse, canyon as throat—specific, not generic. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
