<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guardianship vs homesickness—are embodied in the pendant burn and the deliberate toss; her interiority is specific, not label-speak. The final renunciation carries visible cost (loss of the cultist’s trust, entry into uncertain library) and is foreshadowed by mentor’s note. Relationship with cultist is thin but sufficient for single-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: tossing the pendant reweights “boundaries of light” from prison to door. Causal chain—lure, wait, toss, path opens—holds under Causal lens; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by 3rd paragraph; deliberate mist disorientation pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen garden’s mist, ice, and moss path actively constrain tactics (crouching, clawing soil, visible path). Sensory selection (rime, blue flame) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Final moss heartbeat charges the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guard oath vs dimensional homesickness—tightens when pendant’s symbols mirror childhood walls. One meaningful turn: tossing pendant forecloses cultist alliance and opens library door. Cost is legible: cultist’s scream and her irrevocable step onto moss path.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of uncertainty-as-home emerges through concrete beats: forged invitation, tossed key, mentor’s lantern. Final image reframes “boundaries of light” without moralizing. Subtext in cultist’s tremor and Mara’s rare smile deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is feral-librarian: “dimensionally homesick heart,” “ice-crusted soil,” perceptual signature sharp. Syntax tightens under pressure—“ice cracking beneath her bare feet.” Dialogue minimal but subtext-laden (“You… invite it”). No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“garden felt less like a place and more like a thought”) is sparse and earned. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: feral librarian + dimensional homesickness + mist garden ritual. Pendant-as-key trope is reweighted from MacGuffin to self-key. Risky interiorizing-exteriors technique is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
