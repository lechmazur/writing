<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s tactile “seeing” is embodied and specific; her interiority stays grounded in heat and vibration. The micro-choice to trust the water basin’s light reconfigures her stance toward Marlow and her craft. Cost is felt: she accepts perpetual, never-ending repair work as the price of clarity. Dialogue with Marlow is spare but status-legible, reinforcing her autonomy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship ascends, the drones fly true, and Lira returns to the next broken thing—an earned stasis that forecloses rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact; no teleporting props or soft resets. Orientation is anchored within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist, depot, and basin function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the mist limits visibility, the basin’s refracted light becomes Lira’s diagnostic tool. The anchor lift’s creaks supply a temporal metronome. Details are filtered through Lira’s tactile POV, never touristic. The basin’s glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><<comment>Dominant stake—decode the drone’s feedback to ensure the maiden voyage—tightens once when Lira realizes the servo misalignment. The pressure deepens through her calibrated soldering and water recalibration; the cost is the open-ended labor she embraces. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains hers. One meaningful tightening suffices for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of brokenness and repair: the invisible fractures in machines mirror the unending work of caretakers. No moral is stated; the final drip of condensation suffices. The lullaby motif reappears as a quiet callback, reweighting the locus of “home.” Complexity is honored—perfection is deferred, not achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and consistent: “light refracted through water revealed truths no machine could hide” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during soldering, longer cadences during reflection. No POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. Dialogue with Marlow carries subtext in grunts and half-sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “liquid sunlight,” “skeletal frame of the anchor lift.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence advances craft, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm accelerates during the soldering beat and breathes at closure. Minor elevated diction (“iridescence flashing”) stays within Lira’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of blind artisan, refractive water diagnostics, and hummingbird drones feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of disability-as-insight and mentor approval are transformed through tactile specificity and earned quiet. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate but coherent; the unconventional closure (return to bench) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
