<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and “confidently uncertain” mantra are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the warmed pen, quickening pace). Interior contradiction—fixer vs listener—drives the final renunciation. Lira’s presence forces status shift and crystallizes the cost of letting go. Flaw (hubris) compounds until Elias accepts collaborative stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anomaly reacts to Elias → Lira intervenes → he chooses to witness instead of edit. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses the “fixer” path and walks toward apology; cost is the irreversible blight and his relinquished control. Orientation anchored by crater and pen within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is not backdrop; it warps choices—stones hang until Lira uses the pen, then fall. Pen itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final decision. Sensory detail is selective (prismatic shards, humming teeth) and filtered through Elias’s interpreter lens. Final image of smoke curling re-grounds the shift to ordinary gravity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—undo the blight—tightens when Elias learns he must relinquish control. One decisive turn: from “I need to fix” to “I will listen.” Cost is explicit: the girl’s fate remains contingent, his certainty surrendered. Escalation driven by anomaly’s reaction to his presence, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—history as collaborative web—emerges through Elias’s shift from editor to witness. Subtext in Lira’s floating dress and the pen’s warmth carries the reconfiguration without moralizing. Final image of “turning mistakes into seeds” offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature blends scientific detachment with synesthetic awe (“prismatic shards that prickled skin”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during anomaly shudder, longer reflective cadence at close. No head-hopping; Lira’s dialogue carries distinct, oracular diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “gravity flickering” compresses cause and effect. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent—web, seeds, threshing—without purple drift. Final line lands clean, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-editor meets meaning-editor inside a living gravitational anomaly. Trope of “fixing the past” is inverted—solution is relinquish, not rewrite. Specific constellation-etched nib and anomaly’s hum feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in blending hard-SF anomaly with lyric closure pays off.</comment>
