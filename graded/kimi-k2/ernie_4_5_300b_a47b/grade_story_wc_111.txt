<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile tending of vines and marbles embodies motive—but Joren’s shift from skeptic to apprentice feels compressed; the cost of her stance is implied rather than dramatized in her body. Still, her contradictory impulses (defiance vs. caretaking) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the maze blooming “because of its wounds” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—each vine redirection triggers algorithmic recalibration—though the single-scene arc could use one more tightening beat before the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The maze’s sensor vines and shifting hedges constrain every tactical choice; the dresser’s cracked marbles function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “deep green that seemed to absorb light” edges toward familiar palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving human touch still matters—escalates through Elara’s deliberate sabotage of a sensor; the tightening forces the maze to recalibrate, narrowing options. Cost is visible (time, risk of being lost), but the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “mended deception” emerges organically from cracked marbles and redirected vines; no moralizing final paragraph. The ending’s reweighting of wounds as generative offers resonant ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s gnarled hands and pragmatic diction. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue between Elara and Joren carries subtext, though Joren’s speech occasionally flirts with exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and earned. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ledger of resilience”) is justified by Elara’s reflective moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The quantified-luck maze and cracked-marble ledger synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious frame. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse if the marbles or maze logic were swapped for generic symbols.</comment>
