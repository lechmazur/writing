<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—scholarly skepticism vs. longing for wonder—surface in the tremor of his hand on the seal and the ache in his teeth. The woman’s nimble patience is embodied in her silent step over ivy, not labeled. Their shared history of “agreed-upon lies” is dramatized through the sugar/tea micro-choice that reweights trust. Final stance crystallizes when he speaks from bone, not throat—cost is the library’s shudder and the voice in the walls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library answers, stakes reconfigured, cost audible in dust and vibration. Causal lens holds: sugar borrowing → weekly lies → tonight’s lie to the building. One transition (garden to dome) is clean. No orientation drift; rooftop, meteor shower, and seal are anchored early. Cost is on-page: “the library shuddered… a voice answered.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Wisteria, wrought-iron, and meteor streaks are filtered through Elias’s hush of anticipation; the seal’s shifting engravings act as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Rooftop garden’s cracked pavers and ivy guide the woman’s nimble path; the dome’s glass fractures starlight into the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to vibration in teeth under pressure. Weather (meteor shower) is causal, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to awaken the library’s language. Escalation tightens once: from shared lies to the lie told to the building. Agency is Elias’s decision to speak; cost is the audible voice in the walls. No coincidence resolves; meteor shower is sign, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and awakening—lies as lullabies versus truth as earthquake. Subtext in the woman’s “adjust the truth” and Elias’s bone-deep utterance. Final image reweights prior lies: the building was never asleep, only waiting. No moralizing; resonance is visceral in dust and voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, fitting a tutor of dead languages. Compression in “language of old buildings wasn’t spoken—it was felt” teaches the pattern. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elias. Dialogue carries subtext: “You’re interrogating me… With silence. With waiting.”</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. “Dust rained from the rafters” is vivid, concrete. Metaphors are controlled: seal’s engravings “shifting like liquid” serves the uncanny. No register drift; diction stays within Elias’s scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—buildings speak a forgotten language—feels fresh yet inevitable. The sugar-borrowing origin of their conspiracy is specific and charming. Risk in literalizing the library’s voice pays off through sensory cost. Transformation test fails if names change; the library’s identity is integral.</comment>
