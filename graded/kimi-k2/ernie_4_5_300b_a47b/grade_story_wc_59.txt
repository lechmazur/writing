<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Corvin’s yearning is palpable and embodied; the trembling hands, sunken eyes, and frantic note-taking all serve the motive. Interior contradiction is thin—he never doubts the quest—so the arc feels more linear than crucible. Still, the final orb-in-palm moment crystallizes a credible renunciation of pure mechanism, paid for by years of solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the orb’s flare reconfigures the palace from metal to moss, a decisive change with visible cost (the egg itself is gone). Causal chain is tight: egg found → hypothesized → assembled → hatched → world altered. Orientation is immediate; the palace’s stalactite anchors are named by line 3. One minor ellipsis—how the orb transmutes matter—is allowed under lyric license.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The suspended palace is not mere backdrop; its vibrating stalactites literally “conspire” by humming approval, guiding Corvin’s tuning of lenses. Sensory triangulation—oil-taste, starlight vials, moss scent—anchors POV. Micro-setting (the copper-wire nest) constrains the final action: the orb must rest there to ignite genesis. A hairline slip: “marble worn smooth by centuries” contradicts the recent Collapse, but the image is too brief to wound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken organic beauty—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the egg cracks: the palace itself must choose metal or moss. Agency is high; every adjustment of lens or wire is a micro-choice that escalates risk. Cost is felt (solitude, bodily decay) yet the final price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the irreplaceable nature of living creation versus mechanical replication. The orb’s golden pulse reweights “flawed genesis” from defect to virtue without a sermon. Subtext in the tutor’s tear and the palace’s sigh carries the emotional aftereffect. One soft line—“We’ll remember”—leans toward overt statement, but the moss overtaking gears rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with velvet-and-dust diction that never drifts into purple. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for memory, staccato fragments (“No… It can’t be…”) under shock. Perceptual signature is consistent—Corvin notices texture, light, vibration, not abstractions. Elder Thalos’s single line is tonally distinct yet brief enough to avoid convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, memory, or action. Occasional filter verbs (“he felt”) are voice-motivated under stress. One metaphor cluster—“frozen tear,” “dying star”—edges ornate but is saved by immediacy. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; punctuation is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of gothic palace, extinct song-bird, and biomechanical decay feels fresh, not checklist steampunk. The inversion—beauty must be grown, not built—reverses typical tech-caution tales. Specificity of the orb over chick avoids cliché. Risk is taken in the lyric climax; it pays off because the palace’s transformation is earned.</comment>
