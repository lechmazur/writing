<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to decode the rope and the reverence evoked by the glass read as particular; however, his interior contradictions (“patient, infinitely patient” as stance) never collide in visible micro-choice—until the final beat he merely interprets rather than risks losing anything. No felt cost for the choice to “kneel again” lowers this from excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the last sentence “all felt sacred” reweights the entire scene and reconfigures Elias’s prior quest as stewardship itself. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each knot viewed through the glass tightens meaning until the woman’s whisper crystallizes renunciation-with-cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The golden dock’s creak beneath boots, the fog erasing edges, the warmed fulgurite glass—each sensory anchor is selective, filters through Elias’s botanical intimacy, and constrains where vision can reach to read the patterns. Weather and spatial choreography stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preservation of ancestral knowledge—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened with every knot decoded. Pressure escalates into the fog-bound encounter where refusal to chase further forecloses the “loom” path with visible conceptual cost: the woman’s departure leaves Elias in Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Wisdom encoded in humble objects, cyclical patience versus industrial erasure—the theme emerges through concrete handling of rope, glass, and tide patterns. Final image of the dock as temple crystallizes the theme without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice remains Elias-specific—botanical metaphors, tactile descriptions of fibers “fraying like coral”—throughout; only minute POV filter intrusions (“he deduced, he muttered”) break full immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates between long rolling seascape sentences and abrupt dock-creak fragments; only occasional synonym churn (“fog rolled, fog thickened”) and stock phrases (“murmured, heart racing”) slightly dull the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fulgurite-as-cipher, secret guild re-imagined as ancestral scientists encoding knowledge in everyday crafts—the synthesis feels fresh; the rope-library conceit marries vernacular fisherman heritage with almost cosmic timekeeping, avoiding cliché.</comment>
