<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s pacifist cunning surfaces only in exposition; her micro-choices under pressure are missing. The visitors’ releases feel externally imposed rather than earned through interior contradiction. No embodied cost is dramatized for her final exhaustion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pin reappears in Kael’s hand, crystallizing the lesson with felt cost. Causality is causal-lite—each visitor’s release follows the same ritual beat—but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The velvet-walled sanctuary is evoked through muffled echoes and velvet texture, constraining sound and therefore choice. The pin’s micro-setting (pedestal, gleam) doubles as setting-object. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching release—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure escalates only by accumulation of visitors, not by deepening stakes or narrowing options. No visible price is paid by Lirael; the cost is off-loaded to visitors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of grace-through-scars emerges from the pin’s reforged metal rather than from authorial statement. The final image of the scarred pin in Kael’s palm reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lirael’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Voice is calm, slightly elevated, matching the sanctuary’s hush. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Elara’s raw voice contrasts with Lirael’s measured tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“soft as moss”) are balanced by concrete action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor filter verbs appear but do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The broken-then-scarred pin as metaphor for non-perfect healing is fresh, not a stock symbol. Cellular memory as literal vial is a risky device but handled consistently. The sanctuary’s silence as pedagogical space feels specific rather than generic.</comment>
