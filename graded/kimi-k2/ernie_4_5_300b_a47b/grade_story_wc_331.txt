<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the scarf and her restlessness feel embodied—but the decisive shift into the mirrored corridor is under-motivated; the “key” realization arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice to “continue” is credible, yet the cost is only gestured at.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s new pulse reweights the premise with felt cost (“the energy she’d unleashed”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of whispering books and shifting mirrors tightens stakes—but the transition into the circular room leans on coincidence rather than causal trigger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Edison bulbs, lavender-ink scent, and floating manuscripts are selective and POV-filtered; the scarf doubles as micro-setting that constrains Eleanor’s final stance. Spatial choreography is clean, though the mirrored corridor’s physics remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled early and deepens when the library breathes. One meaningful tightening occurs at midnight when the floor ripples, narrowing Eleanor’s options to cross or retreat; the cost is the irrevocable shift in the library’s atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of analog memory as living trace emerges through the scarf and humming manuscripts, never sermonized. The final poem’s non-literal answer (“seek me… in the curves of your mind”) reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Eleanor’s precise perceptual quirks—“curves of your mind” fits her geometry obsession. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue with the patron is brief but carries subtext about belief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“quiet confidence,” “new vitality”) edge toward template but never stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of hyperbolic geometry with poetic haunting feels fresh; the scarf-as-key and library-as-organism avoid cliché. Risky speculative turn is earned by earlier textual cues, not last-minute rule change.</comment>
