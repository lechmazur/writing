<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—thief’s nerve versus apprentice’s reverence—surface in the tremor of his hand over the king piece, but the interiority flirts with label-speak (“guardian of wonder”) that blurs embodied cost. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the stakes leap from personal risk to cosmic rescue without a visible personal loss on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: sky anomaly → ward decay → swap ritual → restored balance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stars re-align, Kael’s stance shifts from thief to guardian—yet the cost is cosmic rather than personal, softening the final punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spire’s ice, fungi glow, and shifting constellations are vivid and selective, guiding Kael’s micro-choices (slippery ledge, narrow window). The pocket sundial’s warmth at the end re-weights the setting as intimate tool rather than backdrop, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent collapse of Aetheria—escalates through each swap’s tremor and whine, tightening Kael’s options. The final swap crystallizes the cost (silence vial) and narrows his identity, though the price feels borne by the city more than by him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: reverence for hidden wonder versus pragmatic theft. The final image of the warming sundial quietly re-prices the premise—mystery demands surrender of certainty—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise (“dagger of frost,” “liquid starlight”), modulating under pressure. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature remains consistent, though occasional elevated diction edges toward grandeur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor (“belly of a storm cloud”) and a near-paraphrase loop (“he’d done it… he’d amended”) slightly dull the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The chessboard-as-cosmic-circuit trope is refreshed through tactile specificity and the secret-laden replicas. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, though the risk remains largely conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
