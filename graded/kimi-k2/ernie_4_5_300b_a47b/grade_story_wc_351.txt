<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s fractal mindset and archeologist-of-dreams motive are embodied in tactile soldering and laser etching; the final smile and racing heart crystallize earned cost. Interiority stays concrete, but “chaotically precise” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s transformed surface and entangled memories foreclose Kael’s prior isolation with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a minor Orientation lag at the canyon’s first mention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Moonlit canyon and shifting symbols anchor place and mood; the mirror itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory selection is vivid yet selective, though canyon geography stays lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rewiring reality to salvage abandoned dreams—tightens through escalating risk of memory bleed. One decisive deepening when Kael’s own failures flood the interface; cost is felt in the trembling hands and racing heart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-artifact emerges from etched glass and entangled voices, culminating in a non-literal reweighting of self and history. Avoids overt moralizing; resonance lingers in the mirrored mosaic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—fractal, metallic, synaptic. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is purposeful. Minor loop risk in “chaotically precise” repetitions, but no artifact obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Synaptic-plasticity memory graft via broken mirror feels fresh and inevitable; avoids stock tropes of either hard-SF or dream archaeology. Specificity of liquid-crystal vial and neuro-interface grounds the risk.</comment>
