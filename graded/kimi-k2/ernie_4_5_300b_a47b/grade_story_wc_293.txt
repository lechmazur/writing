<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his noticing of “wind curled around the pine boughs” and the flake’s “heartbeat trapped in glass” grounds his obsession. Yet the pivot from passive recounting to active choice (“ready to play…one more time”) is asserted rather than dramatized; we feel the cost conceptually, not viscerally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the flake clears, the world re-sets, and Elias faces a charged choice. Causal linkage is mostly implied (“because he played, therefore he arrives”), but the ellipsis is taught early and the final image crystallizes options with felt possibility-cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The pullout’s resin-and-oil scent and the van’s glovebox anchor us quickly; the mountains “rising like ancient sentinels” mirror Elias’s watchfulness. Micro-setting (the flake in palm) constrains the final act, but the environment itself does not tighten tactics—more backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“sculpt possibility from the ashes of never”—is signaled early and tightened once when the flake’s pattern locks into coordinates. The cost is conceptual (loss of prior reality) rather than tangible; escalation is single-note but coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of rewriting unlived paths emerges through the flake’s transformation and the bridge-song’s mythic weight, never sermonized. The final moment reframes “never” as raw material, offering a resonant, non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured—“rusted hinges,” “scaffold wrap flutters”—and perceptual signature stays consistent. Compression and lyric elision are taught early; the prose breathes with fiddle cadence. Minor drift into abstract phrasing (“sculpt possibility”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean and rhythmic; sensory nouns and strong verbs carry load. Occasional stacked metaphors (“threads of light,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Appalachian fiddle myth with glitch-art “pixelated amnesty” feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration; no derivative echoes noted.</comment>
