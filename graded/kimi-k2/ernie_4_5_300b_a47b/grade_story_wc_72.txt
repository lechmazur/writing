<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is palpable and consistent: fear, dawning wonder, cost of grandmother’s lost humanity all register via body and choice. Contradictory impulses—duty vs grief—do not alternate in summary but braid within single beats. The final act of drinking the serum is earned by prior causality and visibly costs her: “garden shuddered, as if breathing.” Yet the stone statue’s empathy remains telegraphed more than fully dramatized in action, keeping it shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via accumulating imagery and revelation until closure reweights meaning. The orientation of place/time is secured within ~120 words. Closure achieves Charged Poise: Mara’s ingestion crystallizes stakes and reconfigures the premise (“not a tomb, but a laboratory”) with undeniable cost. One seam artifact—teleported thread from ship to pool without spatial linkage—nicks coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent city garden is never decorative; algae-lit stone and cracked pedestal actively guide Mara’s excavation. Every detail filters through her pressure-narrowed senses. The final image of garden “breathing” charges the closure—setting itself reconfigures stake and meaning under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Dominant early stake: cure for blight → possible recovery of grandmother. Pressure escalates as pedestal cracks reveal toxic hope; cost tightens when Mara ingests the serum, linking personal loss to planetary stakes. Missing half-point because the thread’s function mid-process is compressed rather than fully tested.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from sacrifice vs survival ambiguity, no thesis stated. Subtext resides in images—foxglove turned lifebringer, stone learning kindness. The ending reconfigures tragedy as ongoing stewardship without a moral packaged in lines.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice stays submerged in tactile marine diction; Mara’s thought-rhythms accelerate mid-dive and slow during revelation—syntax modulates pressure. No head-hop; Lumen’s words arrive as sensory telepathy without linguistic leakage. Rhythm is under tight control through closure.</comment>

<grade>9.0</comment>
<comment>Zero loops or clunky scaffolding. Figurative language sparse, concrete, purposeful—“foxglove-stained glass”, “garden shuddered”—no mixed metaphors. Clean syntax; no filter-verb stack. Only occasional over-elegant phrase “liquid starlight” flirtation at 9.0 ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Underwater biomechanic laboratory garden is fresh, synthesized from specific marine biology and mythic guardianship. Foxglove as toxin-turned-antidote recasts familiar poison trope. Ending reweights decay into stewardship—a non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
