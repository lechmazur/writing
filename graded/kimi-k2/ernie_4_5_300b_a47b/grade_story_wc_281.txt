<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s refusal-cum-quest is rooted in somatic injury; his interior contradiction ("affectionate skeptic" mistrusts pills yet longs for connection) stays in bodily registers. Geode and shock provide embodied, irreducible cues that drive micro-choices—each sketch, trace, flare—until the shared, low-whisper “Then let’s show the world” crystallizes relationship cost under the studio neon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens threads because/therefore from static shock → somatic markers → geode → coherent neural map culminating in alignment flare felt in the wrist. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the studio maps now glow with pay-attention urgency), leaving the pill recall behind and foreclosing any retreat. Anchors set early by 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Neon-blue ligature, ozone, acrylic scent, hologram projections tether reader to the cramped studio; spatial and tool use track cleanly as Elias manipulates geode and rig. Environment does not merely stage but actively supplies resources (static rig, prismatic light) that enable the final alignment beat—yet lacks full atmospheric pressure that would push choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake framed: “find the pathways already inside them” without pills. Static-shock consequence becomes irreversible somatic markers that incrementally tighten options while deepening stakes: each map glows with more coherence, refusal of refund offer narrows escape. Tension escalates toward felt price of committing to geode-guided method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from corporeal cost: engineered false clarity versus millennia-slow geological truth of hidden pathways. No didactic lesson; the alignment flare and final laughter reweight premise with conceptual cost—truth found inside bone and crystal rather than lab-synthesized signal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Percussive, tech-lit prose (“fractally precise facets”, “techné hum”) stays inside Elias’s designer-engineer register throughout. POV locked tight; no exposition dumps. Final line “Then let’s show the world” carries shared subtext of partnership risk beneath clipped exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Crisp, information-dense lines propel; only fleeting “therapist-speak” echoes (“adverse synaptic rewiring”) in leaked memo that feels like external label slipped in. Otherwise taut rhythm, seamless imagery. Minor loop: “he would sketch... sketch” echo mid-sentence, not enough to dull the closure moment.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar pill-hype premise transformed by conflation of mineral crystallography and neural cartography—geode templates human synapse—a synthesis that feels inevitable once seeded. Stakes hinge on Elias turning corporate scam into bodily, geological fidelity, an angle not previously seen.</question>
