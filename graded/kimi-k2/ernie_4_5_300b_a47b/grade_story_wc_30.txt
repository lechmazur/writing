<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Librarian and visitor embody the migrating identity theme via concrete choices—entering the creel, accepting feather tokens—yet their internal contradictions are stated more than dramatized; fear-to-feather lacks visceral cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure unit is the woman emerging with new identity, a Charged Poise that reconfigures possibilities (“I’m… lighter”) and the librarian tucking the feather—on page with felt cost—held under an Accumulative/Textural lens of tidal loops deepening meaning.</comment>
<question>3</message><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass-domed tidal atrium, kelp-lit pools, and moon-chained identity are vividly selective; the creel itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the transformation, charging the final image while sensory detail is always POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shed skin without losing wonder”—is signalled early; pressure escalates through one meaningful turn (entering the creel) where the micro-cost (loss of self) is on page; agency tightens the narrative loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical identity and wonder emerges via concrete events, not statement; the resonance lands in the librarian’s final line, but a late meta-line (“a fish took flight”) nudges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited brass automaton voice is distinct—measured rhythms, oceanic diction, perceptual bias toward gears and tides; occasional elevated note of “eternal as the moon’s pull” slightly elevates register yet stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies cleanly; prose is information-dense without excess adornment. One boilerplate phrase (“shimmered under a glass dome”) occurs near open but does not recur; overall high clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Blending steampunk automaton with tidal-metaphoric time yields a fresh angle; the identity furnace concept feels inevitable yet non-derivative, avoiding stock fantasy tropes.</comment>
