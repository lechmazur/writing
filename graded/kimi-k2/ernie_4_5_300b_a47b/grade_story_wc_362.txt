<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for proof yet fearing self-deception—is embodied in the tightening grip on the prism and the bitter laugh at the end. Micro-choices (pressing palm to frost, stepping into the arbor) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of the prism as a tool of discovery carries visible emotional cost and is earned by the preceding cascade of mirrored memories. Flawed ambition is credibly confronted without tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s mirror-truth reframes the entire quest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the prism’s distortion is exposed. Causality is intact: because Mara projects, therefore the quartz amplifies, therefore she must relinquish her method. The cracked car window crystallizes the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, frost-laced car window, and prism form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains tactics: the arbor’s mirrored walls force the final insight, the frost delivers the first evidence, the prism becomes the lens of error. Sensory selection narrows under urgency—cold glass, amber pulse—guiding choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The environment evolves with events (shattered frost, dimmed light) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emotional absorption—is signaled early and tightened when visions intensify. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the arbor only mirrors collapses the goal and reframes the cost. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence complicates (shattered glass) but does not resolve. The price is the loss of her explanatory framework, legible in her bitter laugh and the tucked-away prism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the hunger for external validation distorts perception. Subtext operates in the arbor’s silent hush and the frost’s whispered images. The final image—Mara at peace beside an indifferent arbor—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic statements intrude; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: storm-cloud eyes, “truthful lies,” crystalline branches like frozen lightning. Perceptual signature is selective and biased—Mara notices fractals and hushes, not tourist catalog. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during revelation. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; figurative language is purposeful and patterned (“crystalline branches piercing the morning mist”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—expansive during communion, staccato at shatter. Minor register drift toward lyricism is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—objects as emotional mirrors rather than sponges—offers a fresh inversion of the familiar “haunted artifact” trope. Specificity grounds the concept: hand-polished prism, frost-etched memories. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-epiphanic ending that trusts image over explanation.</comment>
