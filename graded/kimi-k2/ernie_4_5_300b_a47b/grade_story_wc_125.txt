<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, coat of verses—but the “ethically playful” trait is asserted rather than embodied in choice; the final renunciation of the rope is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of unraveled rope reweights earlier motifs under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, though the energy-being’s guidance edges toward convenient oracle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto breathes—clay walls glowing like “ancient skin”—and the rope’s frayed fibers function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; starlight and clay mirror Kael’s internal shift with economical sensory precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of time” via impossible choices—tightens once when Kael must unravel or keep the rope; the deepening is legible, but the price (loss of past possibilities) is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-tapestry emerges organically from the rope’s knots and the spiral of strands; final image reframes abandoned verses without moralizing, though the energy-being’s dialogue flirts with overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Kael’s perceptual bias—poet’s metaphors, dust on fingers; no head-hopping, and diction stays within his lexicon even under cosmic address; slight register lift in “loom of existence” but consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“a coat full of half-finished verses,” “swirls of light that pulsed like living things”—with only minor filter-verb clusters; no loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar cosmic-encounter frame is refreshed by the rope-as-map conceit and the poet’s ethically playful stance; transformation test passes—swap rope for generic object and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
