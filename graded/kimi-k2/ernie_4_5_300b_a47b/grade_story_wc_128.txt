<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s shrewd eye for freight and emotional reserve stay consistent, but her interiority flirts with “therapy names” (“unspoken things”) and her on-page micro-choices after receiving the locket remain emotionally legible, not materially transformative under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Locket delivery → friendship rekindled → sympathetic ripple forms a tidy causal yarn; closure lands quietly (forged praise envelope), earning Clara’s earned risk of civic deception with felt social cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Breezy library and salt-scented pier beats are vivid and purposeful: two micro-settings supply Lila’s cart crash and Clara’s vigil, but setting never constrains the closure choice—still a strong sensory anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—shifts from cargo to compassion, but external forces (gust, unnoticed shells) drive most reversals; escalation is sympathetic, not Clara-initiated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of small, repeated kindness accumulating emerges organically rather than preached; final quiet letter avoids moralizing while charging value of overlooked labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct consonant texture and rhythmic ebb/flow mimic Clara’s calculating mind; neighborhood clerk’s dialogue slides into generic warmth, slightly blurring status contours.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Lush without purple; crisp, information-rich sentences carry freight metaphors naturally. One micro-loop (“salt-tinged air / salt-tinged” 3 lines apart) nips perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Mistaken envelope awakening empathy” feels fresher than tropes; risk taken in forging conductor’s letter crystallizes theme without gimmick.</comment>
