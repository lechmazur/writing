<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—preserve soul vs appease suits—drives every beat; the chip’s tactile weight and graffiti decoding are embodied choices. Yet the final stance crystallizes more through collective chant than her own irreversible sacrifice, muting personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because vendors encode graffiti, therefore Lira translates it into a map, which forces Council retreat. Closure is Earned Stasis—carnival saved but fight continues—cost felt in Lira’s pocketed chip and lingering tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Raft-city grit is vivid, selective: diesel-fried air, drowning-clown mural, gilded barge. The chip and graffiti act as micro-settings that constrain tactics; spatial choreography is clean across the Alley and tower plaza.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—privatization vs soul—tightens when spiral-square deadline appears; Lira’s graffiti-map gambit forecloses sterile grid option. Cost is visible: Council’s icy scoff, Jax’s torch, collective murmur of risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of ordered chaos emerges through encoded rebellion; final image of reorganized alleys offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in graffiti and chip reweights heritage vs profit without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is crisp, carnival-tinted: “fire-breather’s plume,” “suits crisp against the carnival’s grit.” POV stays tight to Lira; dialogue with Jax carries distinct idiom and subtext. Occasional compressed lyricism fits pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose propels: strong verbs, sensory economy, no loops. Minor scaffold—“her intuition hummed,” “let out a breath”—but nothing clouds closure. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating carnival as gentrification battleground feels fresh; graffiti-as-resistance-map is specific synthesis. Risky balance of corporate vs anarchic tones lands without gimmickry.</comment>
