<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile curiosity about texture, the embodied shiver when the cave sings—but her contradictory impulses (stay safe vs. quest) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (“We keep questioning”) carries conceptual cost yet feels slightly abstract; the emotional price is hinted, not felt on the skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s song reweights the premise that connection must be engineered. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (lens, symbols, cave hum) deepens texture until the final reconfiguration. Causality is intact; no teleporting props. The cost is legible in Dr. Voss’s awe and Lira’s open-ended vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lab’s “golden shadows” and the cave’s damp acoustics are rendered through Lira’s prism-song sensitivity; every detail (brass dials, etched equations) constrains her choices. The carbide lens functions as micro-setting that literally unlocks the mountain’s voice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightened when the cave’s hum forces Lira to decide whether to risk the pilgrimage. One meaningful deepening: realizing the mountain is already “singing” reframes the quest from invention to listening. Cost is visible in her hesitation and the lab’s humbled silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection is not manufactured but recognized. The motif of texture—sandpaper vs. silk—shifts from speculation to embodied truth without sermonizing. Final resonance is earned through the cave’s raw song, avoiding tidy moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; Lira’s perceptual signature (iridescent threads catching “whispers” of light) is consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the tremor, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext in Dr. Voss’s single awed line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or conceptual information. Occasional lyric flourish (“symphony of contradictions”) skirts overwriting but stays tethered to Lira’s prism-song lens. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—sound as mineable ore, pilgrimage as laboratory assignment—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swapping names would break the prism-song specificity. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
