<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s observant nature is embodied through tactile detail and micro-choices (kneeling, brushing dust, pressing ear), but the interior contradiction—why he stays once the ghosts are freed—remains under-dramatized; the final “repair the stories” gesture feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, cracks, and ghost flickers tighten toward the hidden compartment reveal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—ghosts dissolve, office “less lonely”—with conceptual cost legible in Elias’s shaking legs and tight chest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ticket-office decay is vivid and selective: fluorescent haze, peeling laminate, layered dust. The cracks in plaster function as micro-setting that literally guides Elias’s climb and discovery, constraining his route and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts—escalates through Elias’s escalating physical engagement (kneel → climb → pry). One meaningful deepening occurs when the photograph reveals the clown’s identity, tightening the emotional cost of release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken grief emerges through concrete particulars: canceled tickets, repair receipts, smudged child’s face. Final image of the office feeling “a little less lonely” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—cool metal, faint vibrations, hollow sound—without head-hopping. Syntax tightens under pressure (“He climbed higher… plaster gave way”), maintaining rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances action or atmosphere. Occasional soft fillers (“He’d never told anyone…”) slightly dilute density, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Ghost-elevator-circus synthesis feels fresh; the mainspring barrel as ghost-listening device is a non-obvious inflection. Premise avoids cliché through tactile specificity, though the clown ghost remains lightly sketched.</comment>
