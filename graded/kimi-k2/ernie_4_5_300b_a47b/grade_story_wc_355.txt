<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is textured and embodied; her humming to tune the lock is a micro-choice that reveals her pacifist patience. The contradiction between her need to “catalog silence” and the diary’s demand for resonance is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation—carrying silence forward as bridge, not wall—earns its cost through prior beats. Minor slip: “eclectic pacifist” is label-speak once, but the embodied choices override it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s click reweights silence from barrier to bridge. Causal chain—memory of radio → tuning fork → resonance → click—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the final image: Lirael walks away changed, silence now freighted with empathy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The workshop’s “aged wood and soldering flux” is filtered through Lirael’s tactile priorities; the oscilloscope and wires constrain her improvised device. The fireworks’ light refracts off the grimy window, charging the final image. Micro-setting (diary clasp as resonant object) directly enables the climax. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode silence via diary—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: failed picks → resonance gambit → click. The tightening forecloses the option of brute force and exacts the cost of empathic burden. Agency remains with Lirael; coincidence (fireworks boom) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as language, not absence. The diary’s first line reweights earlier sensory cues; the final walk outside reframes fireworks as loud celebration yet quiet understanding. No moralizing; resonance is earned. One near-slip—“path to empathy” is named, but the dramatized beats absorb the label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in tool-sense and bodily detail. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the click, longer breaths after. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to Lirael’s perceptions. Distinct perceptual signature: she “feels” the diary’s vibration before hearing the click.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“cobwebs clung to rusted tools” sets tone without clutter. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s arc. One minor filter verb cluster (“she began to hum, she adjusted”) but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—unlocking silence via resonance—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (inherited diary, hidden past) are transformed through the tuning-fork mechanic and the pacifist stance. Specificity of tools and bodily attention prevents generic feel. Risk in lyric mode pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
