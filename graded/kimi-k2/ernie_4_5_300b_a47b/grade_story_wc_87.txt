<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. longing) are embodied in micro-choices—gripping the paddle, leaving the compass—yet the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed; the “weight of her own choices” is asserted more than dramatized. Interiority is vivid and specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The compass as regret-measurer is a fresh, character-bound lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the compass reweights the premise, and the cost is felt in the final image of paddling south without looking back. Causal chain holds—compass found → lighthouse reached → compass abandoned—though the lighthouse beat could tighten. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Salt air, liquid-mercury tide, and the brass compass create tactile pressure; the lighthouse’s “skeletal tower” constrains the final stance. Utility poles as “land’s bones” integrate setting with navigation logic. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress: fogged glass, screeching gull.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop hiding from regret—is signaled early and tightened at the lighthouse: “I’m done hiding.” One meaningful turn: abandoning the compass forecloses the safety of inherited guidance. Cost is visible in the southward paddle, though the emotional price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the compass’s reweighting: regret as tide, not map. Subtext in the grandfather’s warning and Clara’s whispered contradiction. Final image offers non-literal answer—horizon blur as acceptance—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is salted, rhythmic, and character-bound: “merrily melancholic, like a lullaby sung in a minor key.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through Clara’s bias. No POV drift; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“poles are land’s bones”) serve action. Occasional elevated phrasing (“tangerine and violet”) fits the reflective beat. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “return to the lighthouse” trope by making the compass an instrument of regret, not direction. Specific coastal details and the grandfather’s Alzheimer’s add lived texture. Risk lies in quiet interiority, paid off by the charged final image.</comment>
