<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her historian’s lens colors every perception—and her micro-choice to pry the T-letter carries visible cost (foreclosing the myth). Tomas’s emotionally rational tone is consistent and pressures her stance. The only drag is a brief “she understood” summary that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the timeline shift reweights the manifesto’s lie and seeds future reckoning. Causal chain holds—rose death → tunnel → ledger → T-letter—with one clean transition. Cost is legible in the inscription “Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station’s ivy, thorns, and rusted door constrain movement and reveal the tunnel; the illuminated letters act as micro-setting that guides choice. Sensory detail is selective and urgent. Only a touch of postcard lyric (“first stars pierced the twilight”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the buried truth—tightens when the ledger dates expose the decade-long delay. One clear escalation: the manifesto’s smuggling myth collapses, forcing Elara to reframe history. Cost is the moral burden of publishing a truth that may destabilize inherited peace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically through the ledger’s falsified timeline and the inscription’s seed metaphor. Subtext in the scratched symbols (rose/key/chain) carries the negotiation story without exposition. Final image avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether truth will grow or rot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, historian-tinged, and rhythmically controlled; compression like “ivy-choked archway” teaches the pattern early. No POV drift. Dialogue from Tomas is spare, emotionally rational, and advances plot. Only minor filter verbs (“she realized”) intrude.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“the noble lie had been…”) costs −0.2. Otherwise no loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise reframes the familiar “secret tunnel” trope into a negotiation archive, then reweights it via timeline forgery. Specificity of the illuminated letters as anchors feels inevitable. Risky compression and lyric closure pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
