<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid—her “dry wit faltering” at the map, her tracing condensation as micro-choice—but the final renunciation (“maps are lies”) feels slightly under-cooked; we don’t see the cost register in her body or next action, only in a smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rivers’ source reframed from water to light reweights the premise. Causal chain holds—falcon → map → trek → shard—yet the cost (half-buried in snow) is more reported than embodied, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Frosted window, rusted outpost, and glowing ice shard all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—pine-resin cigarette, hissing stove—anchoring POV bias without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where rivers begin”—is signaled early and tightened when the map reveals light beneath ice. One decisive turn: she chips the ice, trading safety for knowledge. Cost is visible (half-buried, raw voice) but not deeply felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as promises versus living truth. Final image of Clara drawing on a blank page reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Jorn’s tossed thermos and the falcon’s silence deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; “subtly confident finger” and “ghostly plume” show perceptual signature. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue between Clara and Jorn carries distinct idiom and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“singular convergence”) is justified by atlas-editor lexicon. One mixed metaphor—“rivers are alive”—is minor and doesn’t blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: rivers as bioluminescent tectonic veins reframes cartography. Falcon courier and phrasebook feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
