<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—gloved hands, burned-spy reflex, pillbox weight—but the “unused courage” epiphany is stated rather than dramatized mid-scene; her final smile feels slightly unearned because the contradictory impulse (paranoia vs. trust) is only summarized, not enacted in a visible micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the act of transcribing the codes into soil, then walking away, crystallizes her stance and carries felt cost (the codes will vanish, trust required). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thawing layers, silver hush, and vanishing ink reweights the stake. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver hush, mist-clung cliff, frost-kissed gravel—details are selective and filtered through Mara’s tactical eye. The bluff’s isolation directly enables the vouchsafe act; the setting constrains choice by muffling sound and eavesdropping, charging the final image as she descends into “a sliver of sunlight.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim courage via vouchsafe—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the creak on the railing forces a reflexive spin, embodying paranoia; the subsequent decision to finish transcribing narrows her path. Cost is the irreversible loss of the inked codes to rain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of courage as renewable flame emerges from concrete particulars—pillbox, thawing snow, vanishing ink—rather than statement. Final image of “spring coming” reweights the premise without moralizing, though the dream-whisper line edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and consistent—cold iron, split-nib quill, “silver hush” as leitmotif. Syntax modulates with stress: longer reflective cadences contract to “Mara spun, quill raised.” No POV drift; perceptual signature is that of a spy cataloging exits and textures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional lyric elevation (“mist curling around her ankles like a benediction”) is earned and brief. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of spy-thriller codes with quiet lyric thaw; the vanishing-ink vouchsafe in snow-soil feels specific to this voice. Not radically novel, but the integration of weather station coordinates inside an heirloom pillbox offers a non-obvious angle on familiar spy tropes.</comment>
