<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—truth-seeking vs. maternal grief—are embodied in the quill’s physical reaction; the final choice to treat the “empty” orb as seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of literal words, gain of presence). Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids label-speak. Secondary character (keeper) applies direct pressure that alters the relationship state. Flaws complicate choices and remain unresolved, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“It’s a seed”—with conceptual cost (accepting echo over verbatim). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of truth-testing via quill and orb density reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. No causality breaks; keeper’s reveal is motivated ellipsis that changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse tiers, Venus flytrap fens, and the orb vault are vivid, selective, and constrain movement and tactics. The zinc plate and quill function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s calligrapher eye. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover mother’s last words—is signaled early and tightens when the orb proves empty; Elara’s agency reframes loss into seed-planting, foreclosing literal retrieval. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the acceptance of echo. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “candor in small moments” emerges organically from quill reactions and orb whispers; final image of planting the seed offers non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in keeper’s hesitation and Elara’s recognition of presence over words. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—calligrapher’s visual precision, synesthetic ink—“shimmered like poisoned honey.” Rhythm modulates with tension; short clauses under flytrap pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“You’re a thief”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught (quill as lie-detector). No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs and sensory nouns. Final line “Truth, even when bitter, was nourishment” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher-truth-detector quill + memory-recycling AI greenhouse city. Tropes (lost archive, toxic dome) are transformed through sensory specificity and thematic inversion—echo as seed. Risk in quiet, lyrical closure pays off.</comment>
