<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—fear of the Ministry vs hunger for uncensored truth—are embodied in the cracked mask and the envelope he fingers. The micro-choice to seal the new poem in wax crystallizes his renunciation of hiding and carries visible cost (exposure risk). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the cartographer remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed envelope and storm-lit smile reconfigure Kael’s stance from fugitive to defiant poet. Causal chain holds—storm pressure → envelope poem → decision to mail—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the final image: scars ache in the cold, risk accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory dome, gas-mask filter, and lantern wax are tactile constraints that shape Kael’s movements and final act. Storm’s howl and ash-clogged air narrow perception to essentials. Micro-setting (timer, envelope) functions as charged objects. Environment directly charges the closing image: lightning “like a divine signature” endorses the poem’s risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncensored truth vs survival—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: reading the cartographer’s poem forces Kael to rarefy his own words and commit to mailing them. Escalation is textural: storm intensifies, timer ticks, stakes compress. Cost is the certain exposure once the envelope leaves the dome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rarefaction emerges organically from Kael’s act of stripping his poetry to raw scars. Subtext lives in the envelope’s silence and the mask’s cracks. Final image—storm kissing wonder—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo in prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, storm-wracked syntax, precise sensory bias. POV remains tight third; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under thunder, longer breaths in reflection. Diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon; “furiously tranquil” reads as lived paradox, not label.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“clouds roiled like liquid mercury”) are controlled and purposeful. Filter verbs minimal. Final paragraph accelerates without clutter. Minor elevated diction (“divine signature”) fits the charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia refreshed through the cartographer’s scar-map and the rarefy conceit. Storm-lit observatory as sanctuary-cage feels inevitable. Risk: mailing the poem under an active storm heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis of lyric and speculative modes is specific to Kael’s voice.</comment>
