<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s synesthetic gift and resolve are vivid, but her interior contradiction—fear that wonder might fail—remains asserted rather than embodied in a risky micro-choice. The moment she presses the amber sheet to her lips is intimate, yet the cost of that act (resin taste as possible last breath) is under-dramatized. Relationship crucible with Veyra is thin; his shift from skeptic to believer happens off-stage. Still, her final smile carries earned fatigue, hinting at irreversible expenditure of self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s “low, resonant hum” reweights silence into living hymn, cost felt in Lira’s flushed cheeks and Veyra’s dropped chisel. Causal chain is tight—song → color → ice shift → sculptor’s conversion—without teleportation. Orientation is immediate; frost, bell, and aurora anchor by line 4. One transition (cavern ↔ sculptor) is legible and serves escalation. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: each hue layer intensifies texture until silence liquefies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice cavern is no backdrop; its sculpted hush physically liquefies under auroral color, constraining Lira’s only tool—sound. Micro-setting of the amber sheet functions as tactile conduit, warmed by breath then flaring at climax. Spatial choreography is clean: Lira center, bell raised, Veyra’s distant chisel echoing inward. Sensory hierarchy favors synesthetic bias—color over sound—mirroring POV. Final image of arches framing light charges closure with architectural permanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tested by the cavern’s oppressive silence. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral hue tightens the texture until silence becomes unsustainable. Agency rests in Lira’s sustained song; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: her breath fogs, cheeks flush, resin scent hints at bodily tax. One deepening beat—stalactites drip into arches—narrows options to irreversible transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from synesthetic alchemy: wonder is not luxury but metabolic necessity, proven by ice turning to hymn. Subtext lives in gesture—Veyra’s chisel pauses, then carves wings—implying art reborn. No moralizing; final line “certified wonder as inevitable” is spoken after the proof, not before. Ambiguity lingers: will the aurora fade, leaving them colder? Resonance is concrete, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, selective, and rhythmically controlled: “frost spiraled like ghostly breath” teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; Veyra’s interior is inferred through external cues (chisel hover, smudge of color). Diction stays within Lira’s sensorium—“resinous scent,” “indigo ink”—without purple drift. Final cadence slows into crystallized poise: “oscillating between repose and revelation, forever.” Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “sound bloomed as color, and silence pooled like indigo ink” performs two jobs—metaphor and causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphorical coherence maintained; no contradictory vehicles. Minor elevated diction (“celestial harp”) is voice-motivated. Final paragraph breathes, allowing resonance without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic bell-ringer thawing silence with auroral color is fresh synthesis, not trope recycling. Transformation test: story collapses if Lira’s gift is removed. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off when ice becomes architecture. Specificity—“runes that hummed when tilted just so”—anchors invention. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
