<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s blank mask and ritual carving create a credible contradiction—she performs indifference while preserving memory. Interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices (crumbling petal, tracing grain). The final renunciation—“I will carve another”—earns its cost by foreclosing open grief under mandate threat. Motive remains consistent, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each carving beat deepens the pattern until the final image crystallizes “lightness” as defiance. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spoon and turbines reconfigure meaning with felt cost (“I will carve another” forecloses public mourning). One minor ellipsis (how she evades surveillance) accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbines, and scrap wood form a micro-setting that constrains every move: turbines drown voice, scrap dictates material, shadows meter time. Sensory selection is urgent—petal ash on fingertips, oil gleam on spoon. The turbines’ shadows swallowing light directly charges the final image. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory without visible grief—tightens via each carving stroke; the mandate’s threat supplies coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening: the spoon’s completion reweights “emptiness and fullness,” foreclosing open sorrow. Cost is visible in the ash-stained fingertips and the promise of endless repetition. No reversals required; escalation is accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s unerasable persistence emerges from the spoon’s bowl and the turbines’ drone, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture—polishing as defiance, ash as memory. Final whisper reweights “lightness” without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, ritualistic; diction mirrors Lirael’s flat affect yet accumulates texture through woodworking lexicon. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Rhythm slows during carving, quickens at ash crumble—controlled modulation. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances craft or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “The grain is the wood’s memory” is earned, not ornamental. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality via concrete return to spoon and turbines. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mandated joy reframed through woodworking ritual. Wind turbines as memory thieves feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in dramatizing a spoon-carving scene pays off by making the mundane luminous. No derivative scaffolding.</comment>
