<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation to “rescue dying arts” is explicit and consistent, but interiority drifts into summary (“her voice had frayed”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—to host a festival and bake bread—earns its cost through the children’s hopeful faces and the oven’s heat, yet the emotional stakes feel slightly generalized rather than uniquely hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila commits to revival with visible cost—flour on faces, off-key songs, the beekeeper’s absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of rising warmth against grotto chill reweights the stake. One transition (cottage → pool) is clean; orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s damp cold and crystalline pool constrain action—dough must be kneaded near the oven, songs echo against stone. The emerald lens reappears at closure, catching torchlight to crystallize the new communal stance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“arts are dying”—is signaled early and tightened when Lila decides the lens will grace the stage. The pressure is coherent: fewer artists, vanished bees, spring thaw as deadline. Cost is felt in the beekeeper’s absence and the children’s untrained voices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of art as survival emerges through concrete acts: baking initials, propping the lens, singing off-key. No moralizing; the final image of flour-smudged children reweights exile into continuity. Subtext hums in the beekeeper-shaped silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Lila’s curator precision—“moss-carved arches,” “rosewater dread.” Syntax modulates with temperature: longer clauses in warmth, clipped notes in chill. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “the arts weren’t dead; they’d just been frozen” could trim, but it does not stall momentum or blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar refugee-art trope is refreshed by the grotto’s living museum and the baking ritual. The emerald lens as stage beacon feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of initials in dough rescues the concept from abstraction.</comment>
