<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s stubborn persistence is embodied in every climb and solder; the ribbon’s tactile return in the final pocket crystallizes her maternal drive. Interiority is specific—her scoff at “endearingly feisty,” the hummed tune—yet the emotional contradiction between grief and defiance could be sharper under pressure. The earned cost is legible: she forfeits the ribbon’s daily comfort to weave it into the next eye, sealing the legacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms because Lira mends the eye with literal starlight and copper, a visible before/after. Causal chain holds—cracked eye → mending → orchard revival—though the breach itself is reported rather than dramatized. Orientation is swift; cathedral rafters and mossy nest are anchored within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inverted orchard in rafters is vivid, selective, and immediately constrains movement and tool use; the quartz eye’s moss cradle and copper wire glow are micro-settings that shape the mending beat. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and glimmer over panoramic vistas, keeping focus tight. One spatial slip: “sprawled across the rafters” suggests lateral breadth, yet Lira climbs “highest branch” vertically—minor but momentarily disorients.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the orchard alive—faces a single decisive test: mend the eye or lose the grove. Escalation is modest but coherent; the crack in the quartz eye tightens the pressure, and the cost (sacrificing the ribbon) is visible. No external antagonist needed; the breach functions as off-stage pressure that has already narrowed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of persistence-through-scraps emerges organically from action rather than statement; the final image of ribbon tucked away for future mending reweights “deciduous vows” as adaptive endurance. Subtext in the ribbon’s frayed edges carries generational memory without exposition. Avoids moralizing, though “accidental wisdom” is named once, slightly nudging the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail—“petals raining like confetti,” “copper wire glowed orange.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests; short clauses under pressure (“She’d done it.”) punctuate longer reflective lines. No dialogue on page, so no voice convergence risk. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) but stays within Lira’s artisanal lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop: “mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures…” restates the symbolic task already shown. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence slows appropriately to crystallize the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The inverted cathedral orchard and quartz-eye mender feel fresh yet inevitable; the premise synthesizes eco-fantasy and intimate repair-work without gimmickry. Familiar tropes—post-collapse garden, maternal keepsake—are transformed through specific material choices (liquid starlight, copper wire). Risk is moderate but coherent; no close echoes detected.</comment>
