<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and protectiveness are embodied through tactile micro-choices—dipping into a water sphere, pressing the arrow tip—but interiority stays surface-level; the final renunciation (“guard the gathering”) is credible yet feels lightly earned because the prior cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the arrow tip fuses, gravity permanently re-anchors, and Lira’s stance crystallizes into stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of echoes, vines, light—but the cost is more thematic than bodily, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, liquid spheres, and bioluminescent vines are rendered with sensory economy; the setting actively constrains flight paths and supplies the cavern keyhole, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the planet’s resilience—tightens when the arrow tip locks and gravity flips forever. One decisive intensification suffices, but the price (eternal guardianship) is stated more than dramatized, muting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of symbiotic adaptation emerges organically from the vines’ accelerated growth and the “gathering of echoes” reprise; the final image reframes memory as living archive without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with a perceptual signature tuned to botanical motion and inverted physics; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression in the cavern beat heightens pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and propulsive; occasional lyrical layering (“liquid light,” “symphony”) skirts overwriting but stays purposeful. No loops or scaffold; information density remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The inversion ecology and living-archive planet feel fresh; tropes of the quest object and chosen guardian are transformed through botanical specificity and gravitational poetics. Risky world rules pay off coherently.</comment>
