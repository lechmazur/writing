<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—sentiment vs destruction—are embodied in the egg ritual and the final resort plan; the cost is the permanent loss of the river and the bird, felt in the vanished egg and the empty vial. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic. The only cap is that the “next project” coda is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg is released, water poured, and the philanthropist walks away, leaving the reader to weigh the irreversible loss against the lingering echo. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; the salt flat is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat, cracked map, and vial of last water constrain every choice; the final storm dissolves the egg, making the setting an active agent in the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Meets the 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the echo can be preserved—tightens when the egg is placed and water poured; the cost is the certain extinction and the self-inflicted drought. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. The price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “manufactured grace through destruction” emerges from the concrete acts of damming, stealing, and releasing; the final unheard song offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic statement intrudes. The ambiguity is earned and haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-specific; perceptual signature is evident in the salt-crusted suit, “ghostly blue” shell, and the faint trill mistaken for wind. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the retreating thunder, tightening closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of eco-criminal and secret sentimentalist feels inevitable; the drought-as-art trope is transformed through the egg ritual. Specificity of the map drawn from actual cracks and the last vial of river water grounds the concept. Risky structure pays off.</comment>
