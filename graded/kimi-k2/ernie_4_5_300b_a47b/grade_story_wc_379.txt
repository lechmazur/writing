<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara’s curiosity and curator’s eye are vivid, but her interiority never collides with a contradictory impulse; the “listening” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a risky choice. The final beat—tears over the soldier’s letter—earns resonance, yet the cost is sentimental rather than personal. Secondary voices (Mrs. Ruiz, Mr. Hale) serve lore, not pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: locket clue → neighborhood stories → combination lock → mailbox opened. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara’s stance toward objects and stories is permanently reweighted by the soldier’s unfinished farewell. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The courtyard’s damp cobblestones and dawn light are tactile and selective, filtering through Clara’s curator gaze. The mailbox itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final action—its lock demands the precise code. Weather and spatial anchors remain coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock the mailbox’s secret—tightens once when Clara deduces the combination from the locket dates. The pressure is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the soldier’s death, felt at a remove. Agency is cerebral, but the narrowing of options is clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: the endurance of love through objects and the ethical weight of listening. The unfinished letter reweights the courtyard’s everyday relics without moralizing. Subtext lives in the blurred photograph and the ellipsis after “know I—”.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Clara’s perceptual filter—dulled silver, frayed chain, “gleamed faintly, as if waiting.” Syntax is clean, rhythmic, and curator-precise. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Mr. Hale’s murmur about the combination lock carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Sensory details (“damp earth and old paper”) do double duty. Metaphors are restrained; the mailbox’s click is a crisp sonic payoff. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she noticed… she picked it up… she tucked”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The war-time love-letter trope is refreshed by the thrift-shop frame and the curator’s forensic listening. The locket-as-key device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is modest, but the synthesis of neighborhood lore and personal artifact is deft.</comment>
