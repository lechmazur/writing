<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Petra’s interior contradiction—eloquence vs futility—is embodied in her grip on the clipboard and her refusal to smile at the end; the joint-stewardship clause forces a visible cost (both leaders balk) and earns her quiet belief. The brass limb and whispered benediction give Rourke and Laure distinct micro-choices under pressure. Minor slip: “price of redemption” is named rather than dramatized until the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Petra adds the orphan clause, extracts reluctant signatures, and accepts the lifelong upkeep cost—“tomorrow and tomorrow again.” Causal chain holds: river-ritual → drink → signatures → new clause → acceptance. Lens is Causal; every beat narrows options toward the final concession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s marble cracks, torchlit mortar, and moonlit comet all constrain the ritual space; the cracked helmet becomes a micro-setting that absorbs torchlight and dictates the drink-or-yield choice. Weather and celestial motion track coherently across the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break the cycle of futile treaties—is signaled early; pressure tightens when both leaders must drink from the same helmet, then spikes when Petra risks their wrath with the orphan clause. Cost is visible: Rourke’s spit, Laure’s whisper, Petra’s silent acceptance of perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “flawed beauty” emerges from the cracked marble, scarred parchment, and Petra’s bruised conscience; no moralizing, only the final image of moonlight on an unhealed terrace. Subtext in the helmet’s shared water carries the weight of betrayal and hope simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“marble laced with gold cracks that glimmered like tired constellations.” Petra’s perceptual signature filters every detail through fatigue and guarded hope. No head-hopping; Rourke’s clink and Laure’s benediction remain externally observed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and pressure—“water trailing down scar tissue that maps could not depict.” No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with the artillery echo and final wind. Occasional elevated diction (“investing them with promises”) fits the ceremonial register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar war-parley frame is transformed by the river-ritual in a cracked helmet and the orphan-stewardship clause—specific, grounded choices that could not be transplanted. The comet and twin moons feel inevitable in hindsight, recharging the terrace’s memory.</comment>
