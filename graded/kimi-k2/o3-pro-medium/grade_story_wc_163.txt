<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her belief that the feather “still smelled of migration” is embodied and stakes her identity. The micro-choice to leave the feather behind at the airlock crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Lio’s presence is thin; his dialogue is functional but not a crucible. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with one earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s remembered lullaby reweights Mara’s sense of belonging without tidy resolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (shrimp, star-beam, archived voices) deepens the pattern until the final exhale. Sunrise deadline tightens once, then releases. No causality breaks; cost is felt in the relinquished feather.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned facility is rendered through precise, POV-filtered detail—“algal lanterns flickered like distant galaxies”—that constrains movement and calibrates the projectors. The brass plaque and shattered dome are not scenery but tools that shape the final data harvest. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Environment actively charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tested by the sunrise clock. One meaningful tightening: the alarm forces the choice to leave the feather. Cost is visible in the relinquished relic and the fading hum. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through concrete particulars—feather, mosaic, tidal lullaby—never asserted. Final image of ascending “to both sky and sea” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in shared exhale and tear-pearls deepens the emotional aftereffect. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“shadowseam wonder,” “softly ingenious currents”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Mara; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but idiosyncratic (“Then we listen harder”). Distinct perceptual signature sustained to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“lighthouse reversed”) are coherent. Occasional elevated diction fits the lyric mode. Final paragraph achieves crystalline cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses landscape astrology with drowned star-maps in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. The burnt feather as keystone and the reversed lighthouse beam are specific, non-obvious syntheses. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes. Transformation test passed—story would collapse if relocated.</comment>
