<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s skeptical forgiveness is embodied in micro-choices—nodding permission, cupping the jar, whispering a vow—each tightening the stake. Kedron’s “shrewdly innocent” paradox drives the bone-setting metaphor into literal narrative work. Interior contradictions (“cleft in certainty”) are dramatized, not labeled. Final renunciation of tidy answers carries visible cost: the garden dims, the cradle creaks, wonder is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tooth-test → misalignment → heart retrieval → constellation repair, each beat narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the real child displaces the changeling, the garden seals its star-chart of errors. No orientation drift; anchors (map, gate, fountain) are clear by line 60. One transition (descent into chamber) is seamless and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Garden’s living walls, bone-star trellises, and honey-jar chamber constrain every choice; removing any layer breaks the logic. Sensory triangulation (milk-iron wind, warm glass, slick vertebrae stairs) is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (the heart-jar) functions as pivot object. Final image reuses the constellations as permanent record of error—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the real child—signaled early and tightened twice: tooth fails, heart is missing. Agency drives escalation: Liora’s vow, Kedron’s bone-setting, joint descent. Cost is visceral—honey spill, garden’s hush, cradle’s creak. No coincidence resolves; every turn is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “forgiveness as interrogation” emerges through action: skepticism tests the tooth, forgiveness frees the heart. No moralizing; final star-map is a non-literal answer that reweights earlier mistakes as luminous record. Subtext in gestures—Kedron wiping honey like pollen—carries quiet penance. Ambiguity lingers: who brokered the changeling deal remains unnamed, yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “nostalgic innovation settling like dew” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during descent, longer cadences in wonder. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Liora. Dialogue minimal, subtextual (“the garden already knew”), distinct from narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—bone-stars, silver tendons, vertebrae stairs—no mixed vehicles. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates during constellation repair, then exhales into moonlit hush. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fae-changeling lore is inverted: rescue hinges on bone-setting craft and skeptical forgiveness rather than priestly rite. Constellation of errors made literal star-map feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Specificity—opal tooth, plum-sized heart, honey preservative—anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
