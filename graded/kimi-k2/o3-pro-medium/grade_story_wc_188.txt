<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cyril’s combustive dreamer archetype is embodied through tactile black-powder scent and micro-choices (pocketing the knot, twirling rag). Internal contradictions—playful defiance vs. gravity—are dramatized in decision beats, and his final stance crystallizes stakes with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Chain is causal: uninvited entry → chant infiltration → wall mosaic decoded → guard transmission → fortress uprising. Each because/therefore linkage is motivated and narrows options or raises cost, culminating in visible rebellion gravity overturn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Blooming fortress, moonless dusk, guard squeaks, rose petals—details are filtered by Cyril’s designer eye and constrain stealth. The kerosene knot as micro-setting functions as tool and accelerant, tightening tactics and thematics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: invert hopeless protocol via playful ignition. Escalation is steady—enter uninvited → mosaic revelation → guard echo → citizen surge—and is entirely driven by protagonist’s choices; roses lowered tally physical price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion as celebratory ignition emerges without moralizing; hidden mosaic mantra and rose-snow climax form a resonant reconfiguration that reweights despair without preaching. Subtext is packed into gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Compressed lyric syntax mirrors Cyril’s playful urgency; occasional elision (filter, throw) is taught by precedent and flows. Free-indirect style anchors perceptual signature; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density, propulsive cadence, precise verb-noun pairings (“serious playfulness”); zero loops or scaffold. Figurative diction is purposeful and non-muddled, culminating in “dawnlight perforating hopeless paper” closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fireworks designer toppling a starless empire via kerosene knot poetry feels freshly specific; the reversal of gravity as festival toys with genre rebellion yet lands inevitable under accumulated pressure and closure cost.</comment>
