<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurora’s guilt and alchemical identity are embodied through tactile ritual; the confession etched in tin is earned by prior jealousy. Jory’s cinder-form externalizes cost without slipping into sentimentality. Micro-choices (dropping coin, striking anvil) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight reserve: Jory’s minimal agency keeps relationship crucible from full ignition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reforged coin fuses guilt and redemption, sparks freezing into luminous footprints. Causal chain—coin → confession → alloy → restoration—holds without gaps. Cost is visible when Aurora must witness her own cracked reflection in Jory’s restored chest. Lens is Causal; every beat narrows options toward the final strike.</comment>

<comment>Rain-washed foundry is filtered through Aurora’s trained senses: cooling iron “heartbeat,” furnace hiss echoing Jory’s laugh. Micro-setting of cracked tea-jar constrains the alchemical act and later glows with unsettling life. Spatial choreography is clean; sparks freeze mid-air, guiding her steps. Environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem broken promise—tightens when Aurora admits her jealous dismissal sent Jory into danger. One decisive turn: etching her own name into tin, accepting alloy of guilt. Cost is the mirror forcing her to witness every crack. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of kintsugi—honoring fracture with gold—emerges through embodied ritual rather than statement. Final image of two cinder-gold figures reframes prior guilt as luminous seam. Subtext operates in silence and sparks; no moralizing. Resonance lingers in the doubled-heft coin that will “never be singular again.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is alchemist-precise yet lyric: “alloy snarls, then sings,” “dawn accepts shattered starlight.” Perceptual signature notices planetary hum and metallic taste. Syntax modulates with heat: short clauses under furnace glare, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Aurora’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. Rhythm mirrors pulse: deliberate furnace counts, then single pure ring. Minor loop risk in “molten” repetition, but it serves pattern. Closure line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy as emotional kintsugi, guilt alloyed into restoration. Zodiac coin with blank center becomes literal vessel for confession. Risky choice to keep Jory nearly wordless pays off in cinder-gold image. Specificity of tin mirror etched with self-name transforms familiar redemption arc.</comment>
