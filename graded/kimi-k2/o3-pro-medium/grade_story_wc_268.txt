<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysar’s regally unpretentious presence is embodied in river-stone crown imagery and mirrored dais stance; Selestine’s scholar’s fervor shows in her thesis chase and pellet throw. Both have clear, escalating motives that converge on the decisive sundering. Interior contradictions are implied rather than dramatized in scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the throne empties so it may be genuine again—felt cost in the pretender’s vanishing reflection. Causal chain (cryptic margins → scholar alliance → pellet sabotage → mirror sundering) holds under a causal lens. Mosaic structure is taught early and transitions are legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The temple library’s dust, chained atlases, and mirror dais constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; “blue dusk between worlds” sets tone without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from scroll corridors to glass hall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened through each ink-pellet deployment. Escalation is causal: each act narrows options until the mirror sundering forecloses the pretender’s legitimacy. Cost is visible in court vertigo and throne vacancy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth as weight that bends space emerges through image and action, never stated. Final mirror shards reweight lineage without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rune’s sideways glances and the regally unpretentious stance that topples spectacle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “dust like incense,” “chains of verdigris,” “constellation gears lurched.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives at climax. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Lysar or Selestine in clean shards.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every image advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating toward the sundering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of diminutive titan librarian and rune-based epistemological sabotage feels fresh. Tropes of lost heir and court intrigue are transformed through ink pellets and drifting reflections. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant closure.</comment>
