<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority is vivid—he translates foam, parses gull jokes, recites reef-Latin—but the final “understood that battle lines could be redrawn by chlorophyll” is an unearned epiphany; prior beats show no interior contradiction about the ethics of gardening war. Motivation is consistent yet static; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Still, embodied emotion and occupation-specific worldview are strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeding, bird-calls, tide-rise layers density until the final image of green spears “arrayed in ranks eerily recalling fallen soldiers” reweights the stake with conceptual cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—battlefield reborn as garden—felt in the coachman’s touch of the blade. One transition (jetty to coast tour) is brief and coherent. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: cracked causeway, iron-flat water, crablike craters, dew on cartridge-colored husks. The blooming jetty at twilight constrains the final bird-calling liturgy and charges the mist-kissed seeds. Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman’s priorities—sound of pods, taste of salt, hush of tide. Micro-setting (carriage plank as pulpit) is leveraged for closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the lapsed stewardship—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: salt-dead soil → bird-mapped nutrients → tide-borne phosphorus → green spears. Each layer tightens the cost: silence of reef, artillery scars, spent cartridges. Final image crystallizes the trade-off: memory fertilized by story, not silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical stewardship vs. rupture emerges through concrete particulars—reef-Latin, barnacle-Greek, seed pods as bones—never stated. Final image of petals “reciting the dead languages of peace” offers non-literal resonance. Moral ambiguity lingers: garden as memorial or erasure? No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: archaic cadence, compound coinages (“gloom-hill,” “avairy parliament”), reef-Latin incantations. Compression and elision are taught early (“he no longer ferried passengers”) and paid off in the wind-hitched carriage. Perceptual signature is consistent—coachman hears bird grammar, smells salt sorrow. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“narrow vastness nobody named”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accretive texture. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final cadence—“petals kept reciting the dead languages of peace”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-war gardener-coachman reviving a coral treaty via bird linguistics—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (battlefield garden, eco-mysticism) are transformed through specific occupation and dead-language praxis. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reprise of seed pods as breeze-passengers. No derivative echoes.</comment>
