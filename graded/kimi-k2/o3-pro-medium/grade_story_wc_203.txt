<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlen’s “quest to discover what ceilings hide” is dramatized through micro-choices—prying the panel, pocketing the mainspring—each with visible cost (ghosts’ gratitude, dawn’s exhale). Interiority is embodied and specific; the ghosts’ murmurs and the “calliope” heartbeat ground his fear and wonder. The final renunciation—leaving the lights on—earns its poignancy because earlier beats have tied his identity to listening, not fixing. One hairline slip: the phrase “weightless burden” repeats without new shading.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mainspring removed, ghosts at rest, facade cracks “relaxing.” Causal chain holds—dust pattern → hidden mainspring → donation plan—each step narrowing options. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of ghostly presence and ticking imagery tightens until the final exhale. Cost is legible in the line “promises to ceilings everywhere,” a felt anchor that forecloses endless wandering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The abandoned ticket office is no backdrop; its crawl space and sagging vent physically constrain Marlen’s route and discovery. Dust, cobwebs, and “peeling clowns” are filtered through his technician’s eye, guiding choice. The mainspring’s velvet clown hat is a micro-setting object that charges the final image. One minor drift: “rusted spider” metaphor is vivid but not re-engaged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what the ceiling conceals—tightens once the mainspring is revealed, forcing the choice to remove it. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each ghostly apparition and dust pattern adds weight until the final release. Cost is visible in the ghosts’ bow and the building’s literal relaxation. No second reversal, but the single deepening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time hidden in forgotten spaces, the ethics of unearthing versus preserving. Subtext lives in the ghosts’ “weightless burden” and the manager’s abandoned trust. Final image of the elevator rising like “slow applause” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries—Marlen neither keeps nor discards, but redirects the artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is distinctively tactile and rhythmic—“aluminum legs screeching like distant trapeze wires”—with technician precision. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marlen notices screws, bone shards, dust crescents. Ghost dialogue is spare yet atmospheric, never expository. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Marlen’s embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion—“cobwebs twitched as current flowed.” Metaphors are fresh and coherent. Minor scaffold: “weightless burden” appears twice; otherwise zero loops. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses under the vent, longer cadences at dawn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fuses ghost story, repair procedural, and circus elegy into a singular texture. The mainspring-as-timekeeper is a fresh, non-obvious pivot. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final elevator applause feels inevitable yet surprising. No derivative echoes; every image is grounded in this specific decaying ticket office.</comment>
