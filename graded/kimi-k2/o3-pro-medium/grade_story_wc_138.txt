<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Callix’s ennui and thirst for endings are embodied in every micro-choice; the shard’s pulse against his ribs is a literal cost. Interior contradiction—boredom vs. mortal curiosity—drives the scene. The final renunciation of boredom is earned by the spatial mutiny he barely survives. Only the “dimensionally aware” label feels slightly expository, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens until the prisms kneel and the shard leaps, reconfiguring meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—“I walked toward goodbye with genuine thirst”—with the cost of carrying the shard inside his body. Causality holds: storm → flux → mutiny → truce. No orientation drift; anchors land by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The escondite’s prisms, the storm’s violet arcs, and the shard’s candlelight seams are not backdrop; they bend space and choice. The forgotten second coil is a setting detail that becomes a causal pivot. Micro-setting (ribcage prison) charges the final image. Only the phrase “ordinary radiant secrecy” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Callix glimpse what waits beyond goodbye?—tightens when spatial mutiny threatens to fold him unfinished. The asymmetry of the second coil escalates stakes under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral: shard stored in bone, farewells glimpsed but unreachable. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shard’s refusal to stay put: goodbye as coordinate, not ending. The whispered answer reweights every prior farewell without moralizing. Subtext hums in magnetic lullabies and kneeling light. Final thirst is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is baroque yet precise, a bored immortal’s cadence modulating into hunger. Syntax mirrors dimensional warping: “surfaces swapping distances like dancers.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Callix’s sensorium. Compression like “cooled ember” condenses heat and danger in two words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. Metaphors are coherent—thunder finishing its own echo—and never stall momentum. Minor loop: “thunderous, waiting” and “hushed thunder” echo but serve cadence. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of cosmic stakes with intimate body-horror feels inevitable yet fresh. Spatial mutiny as literal physics of farewell is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyricism pays off in the ribcage-prison image. No derivative echoes; the voice owns its cosmos.</comment>
