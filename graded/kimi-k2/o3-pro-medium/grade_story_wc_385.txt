<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silva’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her dread of communal voice and the final acceptance of the pact carry visible cost. The contradiction between her need to preserve self and her vocation as mediator is dramatized in the chamber scene. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the decisive choice. Only the merchant’s twin feels slightly off-stage, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Silva’s voice now carries others’ memories forever, a felt cost crystallized in “reed-blown melancholy fluttered through her ribs.” Causal chain—shell countdown → descent → pact → silence—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Lens is Causal; every beat follows because/therefore logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert canyon, serpentine nexus, and the shell itself constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“sand vibrating long after silence returned”). Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The shell’s warmth and the fissure’s spiral directly enable descent, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss of self to communal memory—is signaled early and tightened by the pact. Escalation is causal: each countdown digit raises urgency; the chamber’s offer forces a trade-off. Cost is visible on-page (“every performance would now end with memories that were none of her own”). No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, voice, and identity emerges organically through Silva’s choices and the canyon’s stored echoes. Final image of “grateful silence” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shell’s countdown and the loom of threads. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to sound and echo. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (“reed-blown melancholy fluttered”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Silva. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with high information-to-sentence ratio. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors or loops. Rhythm accelerates during descent and breathes at the rim. Minor scaffold in “voices tensed in the air” could be tighter, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of echoes as trapped memories seeking mouths is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names or places change; the canyon’s acoustic metaphysics are integral. Risk-taking in physics-bending echoes pays off. No derivative templates; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
