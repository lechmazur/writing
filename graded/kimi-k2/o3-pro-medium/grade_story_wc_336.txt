<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orien’s interiority is vivid—his “luster of seasons counted in rings” and tactile reverence for pruning anchor motive. The lifelong vow with Liora crystallizes a credible renunciation of fame, paying cost in anonymity. Yet the shared POV dilutes internal contradiction; we see more joint purpose than clashing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing sapling and villagers’ tears reweight the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image—“pruning shears and loom both gleaming”—crystallizes ongoing custodianship with felt cost. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The waterfall, mist, and moss function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the pool’s edge becomes loom, spray becomes shuttle. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. The pear sapling itself, charged with color, anchors the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the seed cracks and the ribbon must be grafted before color fades. One decisive intensification suffices; the cost is the lifelong guardianship vow. Agency remains joint but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder as living motion requiring perpetual pruning of fear. The final luminous hush offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the anonymity of the artisans deepens the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, elevated register is consistent and voice-motivated; patterned elision (“waterfall paused in its descent”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature—seasons counted in rings, woven light—holds under pressure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction stays within the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The grafting of woven light onto a living tree feels inevitable yet fresh; the synthesis of orchard craft and loom magic is specific and non-obvious. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
