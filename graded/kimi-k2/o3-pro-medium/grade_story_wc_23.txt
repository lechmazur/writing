<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow’s patchwork body and lunar-tied purpose are vivid and embodied; her renunciation to stay and steward backward journeys is earned by the visible cost of bleeding the hydraulics dry. Interiority is specific, but the voice of the caller remains abstract, slightly blurring relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marrow’s decision to remain collapses any chance of personal escape and is paid for with her own blood and perpetual vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each midnight call layers density until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is rendered with tactile specificity—cooling metal, fluttering charts, blood-thick hydraulics—and the censer foot constrains the final gyroscopic alignment, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the channel open for others’ reversed grief—tightens once when Marrow realizes departure would destroy the tower; the cost is the permanent forfeiture of her own reverse migration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bearing others’ grief so they may return home emerges through concrete action; the final image of rivers remembering their direction offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in Marrow’s stitched, metallic body; patterned elision (“rivers unspooling upstream”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective, no loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, culminating in the crystalline final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of celestial navigation, grief cartography, and bodily sacrifice feels inevitable and fresh; the reverse-migration conceit is fully inhabited rather than decorative.</comment>
