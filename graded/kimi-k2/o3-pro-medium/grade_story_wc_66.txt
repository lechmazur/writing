<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila’s metronome-stubborn refusal of silence is embodied in tactile micro-choices (rosin-scented fingers on brick, humming A into the antenna). The interior contradiction—copyist turned smuggler of lyric fragments—drives every beat, and her final dispersal of dust stories costs her the pirate signal itself, an earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust becomes the permanent cloak, embedding pirate frequencies in everyday sound. Causal chain (lyric → antenna → dust → cloak) is tight; the cost is the fading signal and Mila’s exhaustion. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ember alcove, salt-crusted antenna, and rosin-scented fingers act as micro-settings that constrain choices (only the alcove hides the dial, only the antenna accepts her pitch). Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and charged in the final image as dust reassembles into the first line of a new epic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore narrative to a story-famine city—tightens when the pirate signal begins to fade. Mila’s agency drives escalation: she trades the signal’s secrecy for the dust’s ubiquity, a visible price that narrows her options to “life itself” as antenna.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of language’s resurrection emerges through concrete particulars (vellum salvaged from organ score, dust rehearsing narratives). Final image of “silence learned to hum” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about regime retaliation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, rhythmic, metaphor-dense—mirrors Mila’s copyist precision. Patterned elision (“Count the rests where thunder falters”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift; every perception is filtered through her professional bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density, and read-aloud musical. Metaphors are precise (“firefly holding its breath,” “dust like contraband gulls”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Final line crystallizes cadence without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic librarian myth retooled through orchestral lexicon and pirate radio poetics. Dust-as-page, antenna-as-score, and silence-as-score-rest are non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric compression, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
