<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid—e.g., “tuning forks within my ribs”—and the shared compact with the poet crystallizes motive. Yet the poet’s own contradictory impulses remain off-stage, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the colonnade’s hum lingers “under every vendor’s song,” reweighting the world. Causal chain (stone → hum → collective unclenching) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the unspoken fragility of newfound voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Cobalt atrium by a frozen lake” and later the colonnade constrain movement and metaphor; the quartz shard’s warmth against cold skin charges the final image. Selective sensory layering (breath-stanzas, lantern-moth hush) is purposeful and non-generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—testing whether liberated language can still resonate—tightens when the colonnade rises and the crowd’s silence becomes participatory. One clear escalation: buried pillars re-emerge, narrowing options from private doubt to public audition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries dissolving emerges through concrete events (stone to song, ban to breath) rather than statement. Final image of “certainty trembled in welcome” offers non-literal, earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric compression is consistent; breath-sketched stanzas teach the pattern early and pay off in the plaza. POV remains stable, with perceptual signature—“lantern-moth hush,” “blue coals”—distinct to the narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely repeats and each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; cadence modulates with scene pressure. Occasional elevated diction stays within lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-censorship poetry as literal frost-calligraphy and architecture that sings only when truth arrives. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands the closure intact; no derivative echoes.</comment>
