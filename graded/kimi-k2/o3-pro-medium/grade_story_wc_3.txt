<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aram’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—tapping nodes, translating aloud to a tree—while contradictory grief and scientific hunger coexist in real time. The final renunciation (planting the seed elsewhere) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the sister’s absence becomes a portable echo rather than a retrievable presence. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “haunted ambitions” is slightly label-like, though immediately embodied by the coffin memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s gate reconfigures from bridge to memory-holder, cost legible in “Gate held open by memory.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density increases until the lattice folds into the ideogram. Causality holds: each translation, modulation, and mapping beat tightens the field until the final charged poise. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active constraint: magnetite vines guide motion, suspension fields lift platforms, lightning pauses mid-fork. Micro-setting (seed pod) constrains the final choice—its photon lattice literally maps childhood streets, forcing Aram to accept conservation over retrieval. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (iron-tasting air, ion dust). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding transition physics—tightens once: from abstract ache to embodied test when the seed splits and demands a choice. Escalation is Accumulative: each resonant tap, pollen map, and thread-fold increases density until the final ideogram forecloses retrieval. Cost is visible: the sister remains absent, transformed into echo. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the physics of loss—nothing lost, only translated—arrives via the arbor’s literal demonstration, not statement. Final image (“echo he could carry”) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence beside Aram and the withheld gaze at the possible visitor. Complexity is honored: understanding is not possession but safer passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: precise, scholarly diction (“cuneiform glyphs,” “linguistic voltage”) yet suffused with restrained grief. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences under calm, clipped fragments under pressure (“Silence answered”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression and elision (“absence transform into an echo”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“lightning…like a patient tutor”). No loops or scaffold; “haunted ambitions” is the only near-label, quickly embodied. Syntax varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line anchors cadence and recharges “touching distance.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—magnetic orchard that grows knowledge seeds bridging eras—is non-obvious yet fully realized. Tropes (afterlife bridge, grief quest) are transformed through cuneiform linguistics and magnetic physics. Specificity grounds novelty: photon lattice mapping childhood streets. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, silent visitor) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
