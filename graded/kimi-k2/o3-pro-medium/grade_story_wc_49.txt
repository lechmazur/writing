<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Orin’s interior contradiction—need to restore vs. fear of recurring neglect—is voiced only at the end and never tested mid-scene; the lack of embodied cost during live performance keeps this just below 9.0. Micro-choice to pocket a leaf signals renunciation, but the visible price waits off-page, weakening Earned Stasis clarity.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens holds: rising density of “songs into soil into sap” creates Resonant Reconfiguration of the grove itself as living choir. Closure lands as Charged Poise—future cycles still threatened—so cost is felt if understated; a slightly more concrete “paid” beat would lift to 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Verdant arbor” and “copper phonograph” serve as tactile constraint, guiding Orin’s body and tool placement; however, spatial choreography turns on a single line about phonograph orientation, so environment narrowly misses charging the final image, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—revive the Arbor Heart—tightens when story becomes literal conduit; blight is embodied in wilt. No escalation curve after song launch prevents higher band; the turn remains singular but cleanly earned.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory as ecological repair emerges without sermon; final “yes, yes, yes” from newborn leaves reframes earlier lullaby in exact resonance. No abstract statement intrudes, letting image carry moral weight.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person free indirect with elevated diction stays consistent, compressive and taught early by “golden stories…ribbons of dawn light.” No dialogue to distort voice; perceptual signature of tinkerer‐as‐poet remains vivid under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic modulation and fresh figurative diction, yet “quiet applause” and “dawn light ribbon” verge on pretty overlay during crisis; no line-level break in closure but minor purple patches cost 0.1 near end.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Transforming folktale trope into mechanical phonograph conduit feels fresh; however, core structure remains folkloric rescue arc, limiting surprise. Specific detail and tonal control still distinguish the work.</comment>
