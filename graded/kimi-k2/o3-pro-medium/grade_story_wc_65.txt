<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Estra’s interiority is vivid—her pulse matching the gears, her whispered constraint—but the apprentice remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final smile and fresh ignorance map a credible endurance with cost. No stock phrasing, yet the “lazy jungles” line edges toward aphorism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the inked sentence ripples outward, a caravan appears, and Estra maps new ignorance—felt cost on the page. Causal lens holds: predictive data → thirty-word constraint → external change. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The obsidian spire, brass engines, and volcanic-glass desk are tactile constraints shaping the experiment. Snowmelt scent and copper sparks on Bryn’s cheeks ground the moment. Final dawn mirror recharges the lake as setting-cum-closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed innovation before kingdom fractures—is signaled early and tightened by the thirty-word limit. The external caravan proves the cost landed. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge’s edges emerges from the ignorance maps and the new blank margins after success. No moralizing; the kingfisher nib’s hunger and the dawn mirror offer non-literal resonance. Complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and character-bound—“metallic scent of snowmelt,” “ink spread like thawing dusk.” No POV drift; Bryn’s grunt and Estra’s measured diction stay distinct. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; each sentence layers image, action, or stakes. Metaphors are controlled, no mixed vehicles. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual cost”) fits the scholarly POV. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ignorance-cartographer premise, predictive writing, and thirty-word constraint synthesize into a fresh, inevitable arc. Risky lyric compression pays off in the dawn-mirror closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
