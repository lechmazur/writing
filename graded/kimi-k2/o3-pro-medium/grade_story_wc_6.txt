<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maia’s interiority is textured—burn scar, sand pocketing, coin against blister—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values. The paradox of daughter-firefighter is embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation (“I will not despise the spark”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: tears as dew, smoke lifting. Only minor slip: “graft” bell feels slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by torch-line and lagoon; orientation clear within 120 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: coin-sinking reweights inheritance, forecloses despising father, cost is felt in scar-tingle and tears. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (sand, coin, scar) tightens pattern until boundary dissolves. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Black volcanic sand, obsidian lagoon, mirrored clouds form micro-setting that constrains every move: sand pocketed as evidence becomes offering, lagoon surface demands mid-shallows kneel. Sensory hierarchy (kelp-drift air, glassy water) filters through firefighter’s trained attention. Final image—sand poured back—recharges motif with cost. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Maia can confront father’s legacy without self-immolation. Pressure tightens once: coin-sinking is decisive act that narrows options—no longer possible to hate the spark. Cost is embodied (tears, scar tingle, smoke departing). No coincidence resolves; pilgrimage and lagoon complicate but do not solve. Escalation legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited fire vs chosen water emerges from concrete particulars: ash-soil dream, scar tissue, coin vessel. Subtext in gesture—unbuttoning cuff, threading metal over blister—avoids statement. Final image reweights premise: water keeps score, not moralizes. No thematic echo; resonance arises from pattern of grafted mercy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lunar time, kelp-drift peace, weathered ivy—perceptual signature of a firefighter who collects aftermath. Syntax modulates with intensity: long procession of clouds vs clipped “I will douse.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: pilgrim’s murmur triggers micro-turn. Rhythm breathes with lagoon hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ashes were merely soil dreaming of rebirth” compresses theme and image. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors precise—lunar time, glimmering bruise colors—without muddle. Final line cadence mirrors cloud caravan, crystallizing stance. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) offset by grounded verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter daughter of arsonist meets lagoon that sings back your own buried song. Tropes transformed—scar as instrument, coin as vow vessel, sand as both evidence and offering. Specificity anchors universals: kelp-drift peace, obsidian lagoon. Risk in lyric mode pays off; closure legible. No derivative premise.</comment>
