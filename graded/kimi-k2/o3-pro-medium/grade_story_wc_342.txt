<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s face-blind portraitist premise is vivid, specific, and motive-deep (“mirror the sky inside walls”); contradictory impulses (“felt vs. looked” desire vs. doubt) live on-stage. Micro-choices (blindfold, pigment by temperature) escalate internally. Final renunciation (never seeing faces yet completing the sky) costs her the familiar recognition everyone else takes for granted; this is earned and legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural (pattern density increases, final image reweights rule-set). Closure unit: Earned Stasis—the observatory is preserved but at the price of her ever “seeing” a room again; the unseeable architecture is the conceptual cost. One crisp timeline; all set-ups (coin, painting method, demolition clock) pay off without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment—living tree-library cambium, plaster flakes “like unmapped stars”—shapes choices and finally constrains the dome into an inward cosmos. Specificity of smell (sap and slow thunder) and tactile pigment guidance create lived embodiment. Final image: “sky folding forever into itself” uses setting as resonant reconfigurer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: create a sky-mural that prevents demolition. Escalation: dawn→day→crew arrival; each micro-choice adds density until the foreman’s “incoherent” radio call and the warden’s final click freeze the clock. Cost: the mural displaces familiar walls, a felt trade-off cemented in the ending hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</theme><comment>Theme of limits and perception emerges from embodied specifics instead of abstractions. The coin’s instruction “craft” reconfigures value: craft as seeing without sight, craft as structural salvation. No moralising—final image reframes meaning without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical (“sap and slow thunder”), always focalized through Liora’s face-blind synesthesia. No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature and rhythmic control remain coherent under pressure. Experimental compression (“sense of scale dissolved like salt”) is taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly polished, few artifacts. Dense sensory layering never drags; “plaster flakes littered the floor like unmapped stars” fuses action and image. Metaphoric risk is controlled—“cold scent of high altitude”—and pays off without overwriting. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Few submissions braid face-blind artistry, fractal coin, and living library into a single mural-preservation piece. Transformation of demolition countdown into transcendent sky folds prior motifs into an inevitable yet unforeseen closure. Risk (blindfold painting) escalates rather than obscures.</comment>
