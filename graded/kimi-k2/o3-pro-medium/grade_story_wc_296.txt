<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inyara’s interior contradictions—guilt for abandoning her sister versus duty to trees—drive every choice. Micro-choice of tracing circles in ice while naming lost truths embodies that tension. Cost crystallizes when past abandonment is relinquished to lake memory, earning her straightened bow. Character earns the closure charge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: prior failure → returning → confronting frozen memory → releasing it → receiving vision. Closure is Earned Stasis: sister lives yet Inyara’s path is irrevocably widened. On-page cost appears in the pulsing ivory seed—future burden accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Expanding circles on water, spectral apples, ice mirror, and lake’s memory collectively shape tactics; orchard vortex itself blocks and then yields passage. Environment constrains choices, then charges the final image of bow loosened after battle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what mirrors refuse to show”—escalates through one core tightening: confronting frozen guilt within the vortex. Agency resides in the confession release; price is past abandonment surrendered to the lake. Pressure feels cumulative rather than multi-turn, appropriate to lyric scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern of finding vs losing: Inyara reclaims her sister’s image by losing her guilt. Subtext pulses in spectral apples’ thorns and pulse of ivory pod. Final image of warlike serenity reweights prior battles without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is incantatory and specific: “trees remember battles,” “warlike serenity,” “mossy stepping stones.” Sensory diction modulates—mist, spectral fruit, ice pulse—without purple drift. Lyric compression taught early through water-circles pays off in mirrored circles on ice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels. Metaphors are mutually coherent— orchard-whirl vortex, frozen confession. Rhythm breathes under pressure: short, urgent during confrontation; flowing return passage. Only hairline slip: one thorns’ “hungrily” edges toward cliché.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Druidic retrieval quest transformed internally: the artifact is truth, not treasure. Spectral orchard vortex as memory theatre repurposes familiar quest template. Specificity— runic-thorn apples, ivory seed—grounds the fresh angle in embodied detail.</question>
