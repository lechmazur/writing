<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s interior contradiction—duty vs wonder—drives every beat; embodied emotion (“ink-stained palm,” “haunted euphoria settle between ribs”) grounds stakes. Micro-choice to insert own note into locket reconfigures past and future with visible cost: custodianship now perpetual. Flawed restraint—waiting for the widow’s cue—complicates agency yet feels consistent. Character reads singular, not archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the note-proxy delivery reweights the covenant, cost is the archivist’s unending vigilance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (petals, salt, ink) intensifies until final image crystallizes. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (widow’s arrival) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jetty, petals, salt, locket, walnut ink all constrain choice or charge closure. Micro-setting (locket interior) becomes decisive arena. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV priorities—archivist notices ink scent, photo grain—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory before it drifts—tightens when photo’s unfixed pocket threatens relapse. Escalation via accretion: each forgiven fault alters image, narrowing archivist’s options to intervene. Cost: perpetual custodianship. Agency drives final proxy delivery; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of communal memory as renewable covenant emerges through concrete events (photo healing, letter proxy). Subtext in widow’s tears and archivist’s ink note. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: memory steeping like tea, shared to stay potent. Complexity honored—no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, synesthetic, rhythmic—mirrors archivist’s vocation (“salt met perfume,” “ghost orchards”). POV stable; no head-hopping. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; purposeful elision taught early (“context changes”). Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich (“Carry it only when context changes”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; every line advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors precise (“soot lifting like reversed rain”). Rhythm modulates—long breaths at dusk, clipped urgency at photo flash. No filter-verb clusters. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: town’s prosperity tied to iterative self-forgiveness, archived via mutable photograph. Locket as living index feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression paid off in closure. No derivative templates; specificity anchors universals. Transformation test passed—plot fails without walnut-ink custodian.</comment>
