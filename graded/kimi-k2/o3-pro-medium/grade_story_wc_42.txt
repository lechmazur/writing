<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eloi’s quiet technician interiority is well-sketched, culminating in the line “let it listen to the quiet it was seeking”—a resonant renunciation that costs him the heroic role he wanted. The one-line mention of his past “camera that insisted on photographing tomorrow” offers a sharp contradiction that charges the present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is an Elegant Earned Stasis: Eloi’s cradle suspends the hand at “movement and rest were the same,” legible under a Textural/Accumulative lens—the cadence shift from frantic spin to poised stillness reweights meaning. A minor bump occurs because the causality (how the leaf-memory tunes gear tension) is asserted more than dramatized, but it does not breach coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lunar dome’s hush, parquet floor’s cracked-bell tremor, and gyroscopic ring as tool-constraint all serve choice: proximity and available parts limit Eloi’s solution. Vivid, but only one major choice is directly coerced by the environment; hence the slight undershoot from top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The escalating stakes—“every instrument forgets the sky” if the hand spins free—are clarified on page. One tightening beat is supplied at the final stop: the hand’s stillness imposes a permanent vigilance (“ready… next tremor”), a felt price rather than an external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Thematic through-line—time must be “taught patience”—arrives obliquely through Eloi’s refusal to dominate the clock, not preached. A touch of abstract echo (“escape velocity spent”) surfaces, pulling it down a point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise: oil-slick air, star-wind over the dome, leaf-memory hush. Rhythm flexes with pressure, sentence lengths modulating from long inhalations to tight “then stopped”—a textbook controlled lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Figurative density is high but purposeful; no contradictory metaphors and only one faint boilerplate (“heartbeat of the station”). Minor filter-verb clutter around “it arrived from Earth yesterday” but no artifacts near closing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics imagery with artisanal touch is fresh; the rogue tidal-clock hand that now measures tides of light is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is modest—no structural daring—yet freshness feels intrinsic, not ornamental.</question>
