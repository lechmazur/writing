<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Caron’s interiority is rich—war-hollowed knight seeking “script larger than war”—but the turn from puppet-master to poet-of-possibility is asserted more than dramatized; the final surrender feels pre-ordained rather than earned by visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: naming the orchard “Possibility” crystallizes stance and forecloses the warrior path. Causal chain (program → scarecrows → missing page → mercury apple → surrender) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the allegiance chorus is more texture than engine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse of endless night, moon-pearl braziers, and curtain-barked tree are vividly selective; the mirrored mercury apple constrains the final choice by revealing the missing page, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite reality shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when the missing page forces surrender of fear. Pressure grows via choreography with scarecrows, but external antagonism is abstract; cost is felt internally rather than through tangible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of replacing martial scripts with imaginative creation emerges through the marionette conceit and orchard allegiance; final naming of “Possibility” offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—strings dissolving as autonomy arrives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lush, incantatory diction (“sap-slowed leaves,” “moon-darkness into trembling pearls”) remains controlled under single POV; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests, and perceptual signature—knight’s battle-scarred reflexes—colors every image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density; most sentences advance atmosphere or character. Occasional stacked metaphors (“glass that never saw sunrise,” “history's eyelids”) flirt with overwriting but serve the dream-logic. No loops or scaffolds; closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard as eternal-night theater is a fresh synthesis; marionette-warrior fusion transforms familiar quest tropes. Risky lyric compression pays off when cosmic script unfurls from gesture. Specificity—“braziers glow with factually mystical oils”—anchors the fantastical.</comment>
