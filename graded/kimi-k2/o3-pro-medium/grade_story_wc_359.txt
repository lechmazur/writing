<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harmona’s interiority is vivid and embodied—synesthetic tasting of winter honey, violet spirals—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. calm) are stated rather than dramatized in real time. The final choice to ring all three bells is foreshadowed but the cost feels abstract; the “peppered silver” in her lungs is the only embodied price. Still, her vocation and flaw (oscillating repose) remain coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the marble door statue crystallizes the threshold between stillness and song, reweighting the hush from prison to passage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bell adds density until harmonic snow carves the door. Cost is visible in the amber sheet’s golden script seeping away and the irreversible change in the cavern’s silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: auroral curtains refract lime and rose, guiding Harmona’s steps and constraining her aurora-tuned method. Micro-setting—the prism bells, the marble block—functions as tactile tools that alter tactics. Final image of the marble-and-dawn bell fuses environment and outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tightened through each bell: citrus melts edges, blue wind liquefies cubes, yellow shatters emerald wave. Each escalation narrows options until only the tri-braid can carve the door. Cost is the amber sheet’s spent memory and the irreversible shift in the cavern’s hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between restraint and release; wonder is not declared but enacted through synesthetic action and the final marble door. The ending’s non-literal answer—the world will hear a bell made of marble and dawn—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: wonder is both fragile and indestructible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, precise, and rhythmically controlled: “citrus note spilled, warming the cavern’s pale ribs.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“she recalled Master Carven’s maxim”) are taught early and paid off in the final sway-still stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“heliotrope,” “oscillating repose”) fits the monastic register. No loops or scaffold; the final harmonic snow cascade lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer, synesthetic aurora tuning, and sculpted hush synthesize into a fresh mythic frame. The marble block awaiting an unseen chisel is a non-obvious temporal hinge. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image.</comment>
