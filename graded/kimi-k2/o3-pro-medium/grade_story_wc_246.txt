<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The interpreter’s interior contradiction—yearning to rewrite yet fearing further harm—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation (to listen rather than edit) is earned by the embodied cost of cold basalt and sealed ink. Emotions are rendered through physical anchors (clogged pen, pricked finger) rather than labels. Flawed past action (“planting the wrong seeds”) complicates present tactics and forces the climactic stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of edits thickens until the final pattern-break (listening). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis with visible cost (pen retired, anomaly sealed). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. The tightening occurs via density of edits and the iris-image that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The basalt shard and corkscrewing moons are not backdrop; their gravity literally curls sideways and forces the protagonist to anchor boots and prick a finger for ink. The pen itself becomes micro-setting that constrains every amendment. Sensory selection (ruby filament, cold stone) is filtered through professional priorities. Final image—the anomaly closing like a comma—recharges the setting as active agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to keep editing histories or relinquish control. Pressure escalates as each comma-edited civilization risks heavier collapse; the iris shows the interpreter’s own past failure, tightening the choice. Cost is the pen’s retirement and the personal admission that accompaniment beats correction. Agency drives the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete tension between editorial control and respectful accompaniment; no explicit moralizing. The comma metaphor accrues weight across beats and reconfigures in the final line (“anomaly closed like a well-placed comma”). Subtext operates through the pulses’ refusal to be “corrected.” The ending’s non-literal sigh of continuity offers resonant, ambiguous wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is that of a meticulous cosmic archivist (“translate the pulses that leak from collapsed futures”). Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long, winding sentences under calm reflection, clipped fragments under the iris surge. No POV leakage; knowledge stays character-bound. Patterned elision (invisible glyphs) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and concept. Metaphors are controlled (commas, rivers, stones) and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Rhythm accelerates into the iris beat and exhales with the final chime. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial signal interpreter”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Premise—cosmic copyeditor armed with a literal pen amending spacetime—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (time editing, regretful oracle) are transformed through tactile specifics (ink from pricked finger, comma ethics). Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration (listening instead of rewriting) grows organically from established pattern.</comment>
