<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and stakes her identity against the town’s memory; Marek’s cryptic guidance is consistent yet never over-explained. The final choice to stay and carry the fork is earned by the walking ritual and the tear-tracked moment of recognition. Minor slip: Marek’s decades of patience are asserted rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s temporal fold is held in Charged Poise, cost visible in Lira’s acceptance of endless stewardship. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each footfall thickens pattern until the fork’s hum reconfigures reality. No causality breaks; orientation is taught by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cracked plaza, mossed columns, and the fork’s sun-drinking surface are selective, sensuous, and tied to choice. The archway’s sweating mortar in the finale directly constrains the “before-collapse” moment, charging closure. One notch off perfection only because weather remains more mood than tactical force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore shared balance—tightens via the walking cadence; each loop raises the cost of abandonment. The fork’s first audible hum marks the decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt when Lira realizes residents remember no collapse, locking her into perpetual map-making.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-attuned-persistence emerges from concrete walking ritual and sonic repair, never sermonized. Final image of night “awaiting their continuing choreography” offers non-literal, resonant answer. Avoids tidy moral by leaving stewardship’s duration open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“wind carried a wild hush”—and sustained without opacity. Perceptual signature is Lira’s cartographer gaze, noticing murals once only sketched. No head-hopping; Marek’s speech is spare, distinct from Lira’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “dust lifted like waking birds” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates from hush to threaded gold, mirroring rising resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Ghost-town revival via sonic footfall is fresh; the tuning fork as temporal hinge transforms familiar ruin-rebirth arc. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure without gimmickry. Specificity—mortar sweating, ivy uncoiling—anchors universals.</comment>
