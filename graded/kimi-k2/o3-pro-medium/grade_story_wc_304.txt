<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the dead vs hunger to wrest beauty from oblivion—are embodied in micro-choices (tuning the radio, balancing on the “ledge of stillness”). The final renunciation—promising to return the spark—costs her future risk and is earned by every prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the admiral’s face locked in “purposeful vigilance” reconfigures the meaning of beauty and command while Lysandra’s whispered bargain with the void carries undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (aurora, static, emerald) intensifies until the final image crystallizes the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, and bone-lined vaults are not backdrop; they narrow Lysandra’s tactics—radio static is mined for the admiral’s last syllable, the aurora’s green dictates pigment choice. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting that seals the circuit and becomes the coffin’s navigating light.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—tightens through each beat: radio tuning, pigment stroke, emerald placement. The final infusion visibly forecloses further attempts tonight and extracts the price of future obligation to the void.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the wager between beauty and oblivion; no moral is stated. The admiral’s vigilance and the emerald’s imprisoned glow reweight the premise: memory can outlast breath, but only by binding itself to future loss.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, ritualistic, and tactile—“snow-crackle, comet-hiss”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the mounting hush. Compression and patterned elision (“radiant hush” repeated with shifting charge) are taught early and paid off in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“lantern of ice” sets both setting and stakes). No loops or mixed metaphors; cadence accelerates during infusion and exhales into the final stillness. Minor elevated diction remains within Lysandra’s ceremonial register.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The dirigible monastery, beautician-mortician, and aurora-infused embalming synthesize into a singular vision. The concept feels inevitable yet fresh; removing any element collapses the logic. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
