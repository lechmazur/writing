<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, contradiction embedded (“reluctant metamorphosis” vs surrender). Micro-choices—plucking leaf, pressing it, yielding to sap—feel botanical, specific, and escalate stakes. Cost (losing full humanity) legible; final stance is Earned Stasis with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accuml/Textural lens holds from leaf-as-trigger through synesthetic growth pattern. Closure is CR: final image (seed in palm) reframes entire rule-set; cost re-priced conceptually. Pattern taught early, paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Nursery, trellis, storm rain, leaf-lit veins all constrain tactics and seed image. Micro-setting (her own transforming skin) serves as dynamic environment. Specific, anchored, atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (belong to the linden collective vs retain human identity) intensifies through each vegetative invasion—new buds, footsteps sprouting clover. Final moment crystallizes cost: seed bobbing signals irreversible path chosen. Pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges from botanical specificity rather than assertion. Image of “sap replacing blood” and “moonlit blossoms on wrists” reweights identity. Final seed offers quiet, resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains lyrical botanist lens throughout; perceptual signature distinct in metaphors like “roots unlatching inside her feet.” Rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, diction rooted in her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose dense yet propulsive; each sentence does dual work. Metaphors are precise, no mixed vehicles. Tiny scar: “storm speaks through pores” edges to purple, but context justifies. No loops, clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Plant-human merger is familiar concept, yet grounded in minute nursery detail and lived transformation. Fresh inflection: using plant behavior as epistemic method (“reconstruct by releasing control”). Risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
