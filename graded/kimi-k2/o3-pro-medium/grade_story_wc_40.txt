<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin’s interiority is vivid—his “weathered innocence” and “reticent” stance are embodied in micro-choices (unwrapping the crystal only after the clock’s last tick). The contradiction between scholarly detachment and larcenous curiosity is dramatized, not labeled. The final bow to “patient breathing of futures” is an earned renunciation with visible cost: he accepts lifelong uncertainty. Minor slip: the tribunal’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the hush becomes “busy with inaudible roots,” reconfiguring language from fixed to living. Cost is legible in the council’s retreat and Orrin’s solitary vigil. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library’s “shadowed” dawn and dust motes are filtered through Orrin’s need for stillness; the chandelier crystal becomes micro-setting that constrains his method. Spatial choreography is clean—crystal touched to floorboards, light refracted onto folios. Final image of “moving roots on the ceiling” charges the closure. No credibility errors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode living language before chaos disguises it. Pressure tightens when the tribunal arrives; Orrin’s agency crystallizes in offering the crystal, forcing the council to confront unborn paragraphs. Cost: social exile implied by their uncertain retreat. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living organism versus fixed artifact. Subtext in the council’s whisper sprouting leaves and Orrin’s refusal to “testify in lines that march.” Final image of “patient breathing of futures” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “dust motes hovered like stalled comets,” “hush pressed deeper.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“spoken narrative failed here”) are taught early and paid off in fractured sequences. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise (“root curling around a heartbeat”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives under tribunal intrusion. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistic apocalypse reframed as botanical germination. Crystal-as-seed and hush-as-soil transform familiar tropes. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands closure. Specificity of “obsolete glossaries” and “last dictionary” anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
