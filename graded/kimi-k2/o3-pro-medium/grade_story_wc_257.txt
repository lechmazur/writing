<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lenore’s grief is embodied and contradictory; her decision to tattoo the coordinates onto her own arm crystallizes self-directed sacrifice and stakes her flesh on the promise to “teach withering to bloom.” Interiority and micro-choices under pressure match her jeweler precision without lapsing into explanatory labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure arrives with earned Resonant Reconfiguration: Lenore realizes she “had become the timeless observatory,” a charged poise foreclosing personal escape. Each prior fold of origami, bloom of ivy, and locket compass converges on this irrevocable self-positioning, the cost laid bare on her skin and in her remaining name. Drive lens is accretive/textural; pattern taught in dreams and tattoo repetition pays off. One brief transition (custodian’s entrance) fits the shard allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory dome, lamplight, and black-gold tools are not backdrops but instruments—lantern intensity rises with her blood, ivy sprouts under touch. Final constellation curtain parting reconfigures internal space, satisfying the 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn her own grief into a navigable map for others—is signaled early and escalates through the stencil, ivy returns, compasses, return swans. Agency remains hers; cost accumulates via pierced skin, forgone escape, and acceptance of endless custodianship. One deepening turn only, sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of transforming absence into collective aperture is never stated but iterated through every concrete object and gesture—ivy, lockets, folded wings, dawn surrender—arriving at a legible reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—jeweler’s exactitude mixed with midnight hush—maintained throughout. Syntax modulates with heartbeat sentences during tattoo scene compression, never obscuring cause and effect. Experimental uncertainty taught in dream imagery pays off cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Almost every clause carries dual freight—”lanterns brightened without oil”—balancing clarity and lyric density without overwrite. Rhythm breathes in step with pressure; final scent line lands clean and propellant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Familiar grief-artifact trope transformed by jeweler profession precision and coordinate cartography. Risk of self-tattooing literalizes the premise; transformation test survives unchanged names/places would strip its marrow.</comment>
