<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introspective narrator shows embodied contradiction—wanting both control and mercy—while micro-choices (slipping coral into pocket, pressing cast to chest) reveal value hierarchy; final ‘translator of frightened hearts’ is earned under fire. One minor drift into therapeutic abstraction at “lotus-hearted ache” slightly cools the pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of coral + cast letters builds density toward Resonant Reconfiguration—last sentence crystallizes new moral map in shared silence with shellfire audible. Closure cost is felt in relinquishing authority over the words to “coral, child, sea, snow.” Transition between surgery end and atrium is clean single move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cracked skylight salt wind, ward groans, mist ribbons in vines, condensation on coral—each detail tightens claustrophobic shelter that forces quiet witness; coral itself serves as micro-setting grounding the close. Spatial chronology holds across the single shard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake = salvage human meaning amidst ruin; each textual smear tightens responsibility until Regrow acrostic turns raw canvas into public vow. Shellfire rumble pays visible cost that locks protagonist into role of carrier rather than mediator.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the coral-as-memory and cast-as-composition; lesson against tidy moral binaries resisted. Closing image of “patterns can lead strangers home” reweights prior fragmentation without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice remains steady, salt-wearied, translator-specific throughout—selective sensory attention, compressed clauses mimic field-hospital urgency. No head-hopping, prose texture matches inner cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Compression disciplined, no paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative layering (mist curls like listening smoke) advances charge, recedes at climax. Clean copy, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Coral-cast collaboration as living document transforms familiar wartime image into organic encryption device. Original synthesis of medical cast, coral, and translator’s lexicon feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
