<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Damaris is vividly individuated through restrained, embodied emotion and tactical micro-choices; her chained state, silent music-work, and gradual self-liberation keep motivation legible. The arrow-to-code translation, self-ungagging motion, and fire-gilt exit accumulate into a costly, earned stance that forecloses return to captivity. Flaws remain tacit—stoic patience as refusal and risk of hubris—without authorial lecture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds from first broken display to seed-vault entry; every beat narrows options or raises cost. Closure lands as earned escape under fire with seeds already claimed and chains audibly loose—the felt cost is immediate (time, body, pursuit noise). Orientation clear by 30 words via rusted shutters and cracked midway.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decayed carnival body-pierces every beat: chain around prize-peg locking her arm, arrow clattering among plastic crowns, piano bench buried in stubs. Dusty glass dusting lungs and cool vault constellations anchor sensory hierarchy by goal. The final firelight spray turns setting into confrontation backdrop, constraining exit paths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the seed vault and evacuate before the wall falls—tightens via audible artillery and the one-false-note jam risk. A single physical reversal (snapped chain link) becomes the visible price paid that alters tactics. Escalation coherent and causally driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-as-seed unfurls via concrete material: arrow-key, chain-sapling, seeds themselves; never named aloud. Final image of golden-broken chains and smoke-choked skyline reframes victory as conditional transplantation rather than rescue. Ambiguity lingers without moral statement.</comment>

<comment>Compressed, lyrical diction matches patience-with-urgency mind; varied rhythm swells with sentence stress during code translation, then tightens in vault descent. No dialogue, consistent focalization, and controlled psychic distance keep moment-by-moment perception cinematic yet interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density—green-rust flakes, varnish taste, mechanical clicks—every noun anchors desire without ornamental overload. Rhythm accelerates crucial beats: “At the thirty-second strike, the keyboard hissed aside.” Scaffolding minimal; only minor compound cliché “hope even in the driest scorched basins.”</comment>

<comment>The abandoned carnival prize hub repurposed as Trojan-gate seed vault is startling yet causally inevitable; teddy-bear display case literally covers apocalypse insurance. The turquoise/bone arrow fletching repurposed as calendar-lock is fresh synthesis, not gimmick. Risky compressed lyric risk delivers without clarity loss.</comment>
