<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The unnamed dealer's voice and interiority remain singular; the shift from archival detachment to the residue of Marrow’s transformation is embodied, not labelled. Motives scale cleanly: price paid (memory fog, emotional imprint). Marrow’s contradictory need—“fix people faster / break less of myself”—is dramatized through the act of inhalation and the aftermath, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is held: the grotto’s texture thickens, the static device gathers dusk charge, knowledge of “grief inside jokes” arrives, and the scene crystallizes in Charged Poise—“some of her patience lingered”—without resetting causality. All causal props stay owned and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as micro-setting, its walls becoming conductive plates controlling the static harvest; the dripping resin both grounds and re-weights the final image. Early sensory anchoring is complete within ~60 words. No environmental detail is ornamental; every gleam either limits movement or fuels apparatus. Still capped short of 9+ because it doesn’t literally constrain the closing choice, merely sets its mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: the client must absorb empathy without personal rupture. Pressure intensifies once, during the vapour change from violet to gold, forcing her to choose the decisive moment to inhale. Cost is concrete: memory fog, felt patience residue. No coincidence or external rescue appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—“emotional tech exacts an unspoken toll”—emerges through the vapour colours, coins of “moon bruises,” and the final line’s echo. No overt statement; complexity and cost remain legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistently restrained-lyrical and perceptually specific: “moth wings,” “copper prongs,” “liquid amber.” Dialogue folds jargon and half-truths into subtext without flattening. The prose sustains its cadence under duress; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Every sentence pulls image and motion together: “I folded the blotter petal into a narrow reed and slid it...” A few lyrical modifiers flirt with excess but none muddle agency or blur closure. Rhythm varies without loop—density is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Counterfeit emotion dealer” feels fresh because the apparatus, texture, and outcome are grounded in palpable ritual; no stock trope reset. The blend of medical ethicist, static-tech alchemist, and underground artisan coheres uniquely and serves stakes.</comment>
