<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ursa’s hunger to “collect the stories walls have heard” is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, coaxing light-fiber, pressing forehead to metal—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is specific (“almost afraid the fragile ash would interpret her heartbeat as a gust”) and contradictory impulses (trepidation vs hunger) act simultaneously. The final realization that she must stitch collections together is earned by the diary fragments and the silo’s answering vibration, foreclosing mere archiving with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of recovered fragments and bronze quiet tighten until the silo’s echo reweights the stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Ursa’s task shifts from collecting to aligning memory-cogs, cost legible in her “trembling notes” and the wind’s minute correction. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One transition (descent) is allowed and serves cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo is no backdrop; its “corrugated metal” vibrates under touch, guiding Ursa’s final question and the axis correction. Micro-setting—the child-sized flameless fireplace—constrains her retrieval method and later exhales gratitude. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and rust, reflecting both external atmosphere and internal awe. Environment charges the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can salvaged memories rekindle collective dreams? Pressure deepens as each fragment reveals Clemency’s success and the silo’s latent lever. One tightening beat: Ursa presses forehead to wall and the silo answers, narrowing her task from passive collection to active alignment. Cost is felt in the “unshed questions” and the wind’s tilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of quiet archives: memory as cosmic ballast. The displaced axis is never moralized; instead, the tapestry’s snapped rod and the fireplace’s ember reweight the premise in the final image. Subtext lives in gesture—Ursa’s hovering fingertips, the silo’s breathing shelves—avoiding any thematic statement. The ending’s promise of “returning dreams” is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “bronze quiet seeping from every slit” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final hush. Syntax modulates with urgency—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. Perceptual signature is historian-sensuous: “ink smelled faintly of tannin and forgotten scolding.” No POV leakage; compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and information (“moth wings arrested mid-flight”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and coherent. Rhythm accelerates during retrieval and slows for realization, mirroring scene needs. Clean mechanics; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The synthesis of post-human archive, child-prophet diary, and cosmic axis correction feels inevitable yet fresh. Familiar tropes—lone archivist, apocalypse—are transformed through tactile specificity and the fireplace that burns without fuel. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final wind-tilt is a non-obvious payoff seeded by the tapestry’s snapped rod.</comment>
