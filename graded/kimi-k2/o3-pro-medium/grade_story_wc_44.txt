<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin’s quietly deliberate nature is dramatized through the blood-on-key micro-choice that outmaneuvers Vela; the interior contradiction between scholarly hunger and ethical refusal is embodied, not labeled. Vela’s pressure forces a visible cost—shared blood—that crystallizes their altered relationship. The final renunciation (document, not exploit) is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “quietly deliberate” is once asserted rather than shown in an early beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor of reframed time collapses into an Earned Stasis where both scholars carry “noonless insight” and a new pact. Causal chain holds—blood on key reverses gears, swallows them, then demands mutual trust to escape. Cost is legible in the shared blood and Vela’s recursive stutters. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating isle’s obsidian tiles, rogue-tracking lenses, and mirrored arcs are not postcard scenery; the rotating chamber and mirrored corridor physically constrain tactics and enable the final reconfiguration. Micro-setting (clockwork key, sarcophagus) functions as setting-objects that charge the closure. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. One hairline slip: “moonlit vapors” leans decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightened when the corridor forces a choice between exploitation and mercy. Escalation is causal: key insertion → loop closure → exile risk → mutual blood stabilizes. Visible price is the shared blood and Vela’s flickering imprisonment. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy over mastery emerges from the concrete choice to spare the shadow-archive; no moralizing statement is required. The final image—scholars carrying “noonless insight”—reweights the premise without abstraction. Subtext operates in the blood-sharing gesture and Vela’s unspoken apology. Complexity is preserved: knowledge gained, but at ethical cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Orin’s scholarly reserve. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during corridor collapse, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“Offer trust as ink”). One minor register drift: “document, not exploit” edges toward thesis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“equations settle inside his chest like birds”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during temporal collapse and breathes in the final dawn image. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent-reality era, shadow-archive, and clockwork key synthesize into a fresh cosmology that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (scholarly rivalry, sealed tomb) are transformed through ethical stakes and temporal geometry. Risk-taking (blood-fed gears, recursive exile) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
