<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the memory-for-silk trade and the final vow to guard others’ forgettings crystallize his arc with felt cost. The “quietly determined spark” is dramatized through deliberate micro-choices rather than labels. Minor slip: the phrase “meekness had been muscle all along” edges toward tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing, humming arches reweight the premise and carry the communal cost of surrendered memories. Causal chain holds from cracked forge → silk quest → woven repair. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and orchard planet are not mere backdrop; their fracture drives the inciting incident and their luminous repair becomes the final image. The mine shafts constrain access and anchor the silk retrieval. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the village without tallying losses—tightens when each donated memory visibly brightens the silk. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the traded memories and Ellan’s hollow ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-forgetting emerges organically from the barter system; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final lullaby of the arches offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question. Subtext in the villagers’ volunteered amnesia is chilling yet hopeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “bruised apricot” suns and “orchard trellises” curving with planetary geometry. Patterned elision (compressed descent, memory trade) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Ellan.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor loop risk in “azure defiance” repetition is offset by purposeful reprise that charges the ending. Metaphors stay coherent and grounded in the world’s physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The memory-as-currency premise, woven-light architecture, and orchard planet synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes; the vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
