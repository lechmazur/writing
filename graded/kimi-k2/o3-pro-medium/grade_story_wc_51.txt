<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Olivine’s interior contradictions crystallize when she must weigh her own burden against the braid she’s building; the moment “she reoriented the flame…toward her own shadow” externalizes that clash and forces the decisive, on-page cost: twelve drams of self-shortage added to the skein.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural arc tightens cleanly: each weight gathered amplifies the grotto’s hush until Olivine’s personal twelve drams re-weights the tapestry and the bronze hush “folds gently like wings,” marking resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Groundings are economical and sensory—“bronze grotto under starlight,” dripping stalagmite, mirrored ore—yet the grotto’s material constraints (flame angles altering the walls, mirrored pit revealing self-weight) actively narrow tactics and color the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The lone dominant stake—Olivine must balance collected burdens while facing her un-woven own—ratchets once: the mirrored seam opening forces an irreversible trade-off that raises the total to twenty-four drams and reweights every thread already spun.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The emergent theme—only by acknowledging one’s own immeasurable burden can communal grief be re-balanced—arrives through geometry and weight, not statement; the hush and thaw together reweight the premise and leave quiet, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The lyric, oceanic cadences (“shingled hush,” “moonlit twine,” “weeping ore”) remain POV-stitched and tonally consistent; diction rises with pressure without losing lucidity, and the rhythmic pulse carries the reader across the mirrored pit without any head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Rhythmic variety and concrete nouns keep information dense; only minor abstract lulls (“meaning resurfaced in living color”) and redundant weight-count clauses nudge the score down a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>The conceit of weight-shorn burdens calcified into tactile threads is fresh, but some mythic phrasings flirt with archetype; still, the fractal mathematics fused to kerosene engineering feels singularly Olivine’s, earned rather than ornamental.</comment>
