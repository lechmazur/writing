<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—her tactile ritual with the drawer pull, her self-definition as “only the hinge”—is vivid and character-specific. The micro-choice to untether Ilren and hand him the pull crystallizes her value hierarchy and carries visible cost (Rouk’s hesitation, the risk to neutrality). Flaws and contradictions are present but not deeply probed under word count; the moment of earned compassion still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange completes, but Mara threads the shed twine through the pull, forging a new totem of responsibility. The causal chain—moon-phase timetable → arrival of envoys → untethering → reciprocal gesture—holds cleanly. Cost is legible in the cracked stones, the hush, and the rattling chains below.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parapet’s salt-cracked merlons, swirling mist, and wind-tugged cloaks are not backdrop; they constrain movement and amplify stakes. The drawer pull and silver twine act as micro-setting objects that physically enable the ritual and later reappear in Mara’s pendant. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Mara broker humanity without reducing people to cargo—tightens when she must literally cut the twine and risk the first exchange. The moon-phase calendar externalizes pressure; the arrival of torches marks the irreversible beat. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciliation as recycled wisdom emerges through gesture (untethering, blanket-draping) rather than statement. The drawer pull’s journey from dungeon relic to talisman of possibility reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—Mara wearing the twine-threaded pull—offers a quiet, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “the hush felt furrowed” and “gale breathed low” are perceptually specific to Mara. Compression and elision (“voice kept low to preserve the hush”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; Rouk’s and Selka’s interiorities remain opaque, as befits Mara’s single POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere, stakes, or interior motion. Metaphors (“windblown parapet in mist,” “chains rattled… already remembering how to open”) are coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The prisoner-exchange ritual synchronized by moon phases is a fresh frame, grounded in tactile detail rather than exposition. Transformation test passes: the story’s emotional logic depends on this exact parapet, this pull, this hush. Risk is taken with lyric compression and pays off.</comment>
