<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “quinine ghosts” and “silver seed” carry visceral weight. The micro-choice to release the seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics. Minor slip: “heavier than confession, lighter than denial” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s release crystallizes options and reweights meaning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reconfigure the stake. Cost is legible in the final image (“sunrise tilted… perpetual maybe”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mountain station constrains choice—thin air, flickering lights, meteorite fragments as pins. Weather and altitude pressure Mara’s tactics. Final image of sunrise recharges earlier auroral sorrow. Micro-setting (rolled vellum, charcoal nub) functions as setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“weight of a swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightened once via oracle’s demand for a scale built from “realities you dare not erase.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the measured 13g of future grief and the act of release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth’s mass is negotiated, not absolute. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (seed spinning away) and silence. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“auroral sorrow,” “counting insects”—remains controlled under pressure. POV is stable single-camera; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“snow absorbs falling ash.” Minor register drift in “ossify doubt” but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of oracle-as-fault-tolerant scale is fresh; synthesis of botany, meteorology, and grief feels inevitable. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
