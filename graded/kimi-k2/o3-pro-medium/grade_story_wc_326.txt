<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to anonymity yet craving coherence—are embodied in micro-choices (counting heartbeats, placing the shard, surrendering the tape). The final renunciation of the memory is earned and costly, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s defragmentation and Mara’s aliveness are simultaneously achieved through the sacrifice of the tape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the line “regret had become circuitry.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is more than backdrop; its conductive floorboards and dish array enable the ghost’s embodiment and Mara’s choice. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Selective sensory detail (velvet hush, silver spiders) serves pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wisdom from failure—tightens when the ghost demands a kernel of memory. The single deepening (ink → shard → tape) narrows options and exacts a visible price. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: failure as bloodstream of growth. The mother’s laughter, once bitter, is rewired into lullaby circuitry, reweighting regret without moralizing. Final image of “midnight solace” offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision (“counts heartbeats”) braided with lyric compression (“snow smothered… velvet pressed against the soul”). POV remains tight; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with stress; diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional poetic layering (“ink now dry as lacquer”) risks overwriting but is justified by the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic death error + digital ghost + ink divination feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity (opal observatory, porcelain shard) anchors universals.</comment>
