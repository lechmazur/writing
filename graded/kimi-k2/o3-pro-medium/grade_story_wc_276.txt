<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is embodied and specific (e.g., “tug on his wrist,” “colors behind his eyelids”); contradictory impulses (hunger to trap vs. empathy) act simultaneously in the release beat. The final renunciation is earned by the prior transliteration of Nethe’s gratitude, with visible cost in the freed vibrations and the quiet he now carries. Minor drift: “cool-headed” is asserted more than dramatized until the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the echo re-tunes the garden and Arlen’s stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer intensifies until the hush-wind peaks, then the cadence softens into equilibrium. Causality is intact: spike in → capture → release → re-tuning. Cost is legible in the final line: “the quiet he had once tried to imprison.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: vibrations pool, hedges shed UV petals, the rail spike anchors the net. Micro-setting (basin of pooled vibrations) constrains placement and choice. Final image recharges the opening “silver ripples” into gentle equilibrium. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vs. release of a goddess’s silence—tightens once when the sky-sentence warns “release or be unmade.” Agency drives escalation: Arlen’s transliteration of Nethe’s ache forces the decisive release. Cost is the forfeiture of the rarest catch and the new internal compass humming toward “unspoken shores.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of echo as living creature emerges through action, not statement. Subtext in the final hush-brush of starlight replaces any moralizing. The cradle/door/dawn images reweight from trap to gift, resonating without tidy closure. One hairline slip: “some songs refuse translation” edges toward commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“feral lullaby,” “motherless chords”) remains consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then fracture into the spare final line. No POV leakage; diction stays within Arlen’s sensory lexicon. Patterned elision (e.g., “fracture-face”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent within the garden’s physics. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is voice-motivated. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fishing for silence with vibration-nets is a fresh synthesis; sleepwalking constellations and a goddess who speaks by silence avoid stock myth. Transformation test: premise is inseparable from setting and character. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
