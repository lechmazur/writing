<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lis’s interiority is embodied (knotting brow, chest-vibration) and her micro-choice to name “unused courage” propels the arc; the elders’ motives remain slightly archetypal, softening the edge needed for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern ignites only when fear steps aside, reweighting the quest from rescue to self-listening; causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, cost legible in the star-punched ticket.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Harbor, inlet, ridgeway, and lantern are vivid and selective; the unlit lantern constrains the final choice and charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate, though some mist descriptors verge on decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused courage waits”—is signaled early and tightens when Lis confronts the clearing of snapped leashes; the lantern’s ignition crystallizes the cost, though escalation is single-note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-reclaimed courage emerges through concrete objects (leashes, lantern) and action rather than statement; final image of rusting chains and blooming constellations offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, hushed cadence sustains shoreline lullaby tone; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lis’s listening stance; no head-hopping, no register drift, rhythm modulates with ascent pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language (tide hushed like lullaby, mist as damp vellum) serves atmosphere without overwriting; zero loops or scaffold, strong propulsion to the lantern ignition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by the ferry’s star-punch fare and the leash-clearing as literal graveyard of restraint; synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
