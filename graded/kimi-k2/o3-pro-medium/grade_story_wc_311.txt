<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's layered fear and need are embodied in every micro-choice; the reaper’s millennia grief is rendered as “lunar dust” and a chest cavity that houses the atlas—concrete, costly. The climactic decision to name the un-nameable is earned by prior terror and agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure ratchets through pattern density—each named monster reduces sonic chaos, tightening silence until the unnamed void appears. Closure’s “Hollow-That-Remembers” crystallizes into earned stasis: the observatory quiets at visible cost—the echo now locked inside their bones.</comment>

<comment>The brass floor and fractured prism actively constrain action: the fissure splits stone, forcing the protagonist to angle shards that scatter light into veins on the void, charging the final naming. Setting is character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—naming the terror—sharpens through each beat: every title quiets recordings until the unnamed void appears; escalating silence raises the price. The final naming forecloses the option of retreat and costs the eternal burden.</comment>

<comment>Sacrifice and reclamation of fear bloom through embodied particulars: atlas monsters, prismatic ligatures, the reaper’s folded regret. The silent commission at dusk reconfigures mythic grief into personal vocation—no slogans, only lived charge.</comment>

<comment>Languid, cadenced lyricism sustains cosmic awe yet tightens breath on crucial beats: “universe in my lungs.” POV filter is unbroken, perceptual signature distinct—no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Vivid image stacks (“meteors brushing stone”, “bell metal hammered in deep water”) propel without clutter. No loops or register drift; every compression earns the hush that closes.</comment>

<comment>Re-angles the classic reaper trope into intimate grief-curation; reframes naming as sympathetic alchemy. The twist of naming a monster into memory is inevitable, built from page one.</comment>
