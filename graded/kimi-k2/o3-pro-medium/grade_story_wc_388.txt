<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical drive and embodied observation anchor every beat; her final renunciation to secrecy is earned by the orchard’s living proof and the children she passed. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is that Hollis remains a cipher—no status tension exploited—so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara burns the letters and resets the gate, foreclosing the path of public truth with visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each discovery tightens her choice until the final hush under the diamond. No orientation drift; stakes crystallize in the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s copper dust, silent Geiger meter, and two-meter circle of hush are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Mara’s final decision. Micro-setting (the diamond beneath the busted pump) charges the closing image. No wasted cataloging; every detail earns its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. protection—tightens once when Mara chooses secrecy after witnessing the stillpoint’s fragility. Pressure escalates causally: each decoded scrap narrows her options until silence becomes mercy. Cost is legible in the ash of the letters and her lonely watch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: lies can shelter fragile miracles. The cursed-diamond myth reweights from deception to shield in the final image. No moralizing; resonance arises from Mara’s ash-stained fingers and the orchard’s quiet bloom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is sharp, compressed, and character-specific—“orchard shimmered like a hallucination,” “radiant as hope.” No POV leakage; sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s forensic gaze. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“only believe what you taste”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured—“dust eddied around her boots, yet inside a two-meter circle the air fell quiet.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates under pressure and breathes in reflection. Every sentence advances story or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The post-apocalyptic sanctuary trope is inverted: the miracle is physics, not magic, and the ethical choice is to hide it. Specificity of the flawed diamond and Stillpoint memo scraps makes the premise fresh. Final image of “seed of future truth” reconfigures the entire arc.</comment>
