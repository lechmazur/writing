<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ikram’s interiority is vivid—his fear of misleading the colony collides with the prophecy’s pull, embodied in the tremor up his arm from the Cydonia coin. The final choice to “go where echoes begin” is earned by the coin-casting ritual and carries visible communal cost. Reflection stays anchored to present micro-choices (counting photons, spinning the coin). Only the childhood memory drifts slightly past the 20 % allowance, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the colony’s departure is decided, the path foreclosed, and the cost felt in the collective held breath. Causal linkage holds—each coin note maps to a codex glyph that translates into the directive. Orientation is clear by line 3; the disorientation of “backwards prophecy” is taught early and paid off. One hairline slip: the coordinate numbers fade too fast to test causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ambered deck, burnt-helium air, and bruised nebulae are selective, urgent, and filtered through Ikram’s sensory hierarchy. The brass bowl’s resonance and the coin’s vibration constrain the casting ritual, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Just shy of 9 because the deck itself does not physically limit the exit—it’s more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to trust the prophecy—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the coin stands upright, then topples. The five pulses matching birth cries crystallize the cost: the colony must abandon the known. Agency is Ikram’s throughout; coincidence complicates (prophecy’s magnetism) but does not resolve. Pressure escalates cleanly under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between deterministic prophecy and human doubt; no explicit moralizing. The final whispered promise to “keep listening” reweights the opening silence into an active stance. Subtext lives in gesture—the coin spinning upright against logic. Complexity lingers: the prophecy may still destroy them, yet refusal would also cost meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, yet precise: “time, after the universe contracts, is all edges and no middle.” Perceptual signature is Ikram’s scientific-poetic diction, consistent under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Patterned elision (fading coordinates) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh—“bruised glass,” “gravity’s last remaining cousin”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm modulates with tension, accelerating during the cast. One minor loop: “quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt” restates the same beat in adjacent clauses, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The backwards-prophecy premise is non-obvious and fully committed to; entropy reset via unsynced voices is fresh. Transformation test passes—this could not be relocated to another setting without collapse. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of extinct constellations on coins grounds the cosmic scale in tactile detail.</comment>
