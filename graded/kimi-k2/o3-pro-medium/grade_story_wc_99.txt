<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Yun’s measured speech and pruning micro-choices embody his role, but Mara and Callix remain silhouettes; their interior contradictions are sketched rather than dramatized. The final renunciation—sealing memory-rings into bark—carries cost, yet the causal chain feels lightly sketched rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the color-mist reweights memory without resolving it, and the cost is the unspoken apology itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each pruning beat thickens the palette until the final diffusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The islet’s post-rain shimmer, coral stair, and bonsai’s resin beads are vivid and selective, guiding descent and ascent. The cavern’s water-light constrains visibility and choice, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color—tightens through each pruning and compass turn; the mist’s refusal to stay raises the price of silence. One deepening suffices, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of apology-as-color emerges through image and ritual, never stated. The final diffusion reconfigures memory without moralizing, letting silence carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression and patterned elision are taught early and held; POV drifts gently among the three without head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signatures—Yun’s pruned hush, Mara’s lace-listening—remain coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with only minor loops (“rhythmically placid” twice). Metaphors stay coherent; no figurative muddle in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai ritual, ghost-compass, and lace cartography feels fresh; familiar tropes of apology-as-color are transformed through tactile specificity. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
