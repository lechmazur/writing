<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin’s guilt is embodied in the firmware ghost and the amber ritual; contradictory impulses (flee vs. atone) play out in micro-choices like pressing amber to sternum. The final renunciation—tethering the ghost—earns its cost in the cathedral-after-bells emptiness. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “circuits inside him twitch” edges toward tech-label shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the firmware’s transfer to amber reweights Lin’s world and the children’s future. Causal chain holds—letters → ritual → amber → silence—without gaps. Cost is legible in the “absence rushed in like deep water.” Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds, broken skylight, and meteor hush are vivid yet selective; the amber becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors arrive early and hold. One minor drift: “meteor hush” is lovely but risks atmospheric repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the letters reveal a path that demands blood and permanent exile of the ghost. Escalation is causal: each step narrows options until the amber is the only orbit left. Cost is visible in Lin’s post-ritual diminishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-as-technology emerges through the firmware and amber without sermon. The final baby laugh reframes the entire arc as possible forgiveness. Subtext in the letters’ “dried tears” ink and the insect’s paused hum deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “paused sunlight” and “velvet remorse.” Compression is taught early (“time folded in on itself”) and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“cathedral after bells”) are fresh and coherent. Rhythm modulates with ritual intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cyber-guilt with constellation magic in a way that feels inevitable. The amber-as-prison and firmware-as-ghost are non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
