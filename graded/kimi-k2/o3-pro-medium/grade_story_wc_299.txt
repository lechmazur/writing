<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gideon’s contradictory impulses—fact-armoring vs. raw grief—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the cloth, reciting specs). The final resolve to restore the tapes is earned by the notebook’s causal trigger and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “confidently uncertain” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Gideon’s shift from appraisal to reverberation reweights the premise with felt cost (tremor he can’t mute). Causal chain—notebook → reels → resolve—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quarry’s limestone lungs and moonlit ladders constrain descent and echo, charging the final image. Selective sensory layering (dust motes like glitter, wind as fading chord) filters through Gideon’s roadie eye. Locker and reels function as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—redeem relevance via Mara’s tapes—tightens once the notebook reveals their existence. Escalation is a single deepening that reweights options; cost is the reopened grief he must carry forward. No false reversals; coincidence (finding reels) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of failure-as-reverberation emerges organically from Gideon’s arc and the quarry’s echo metaphor. Final image of wind’s “fading chord” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in Polaroid and cloth avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—roadie diction fused with appraiser precision (“thread count, period dye”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; compression taught early (“confidently uncertain”) and paid off. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it lands outside peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie lore and antiques expertise; quarry-as-recording-studio feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression works because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
