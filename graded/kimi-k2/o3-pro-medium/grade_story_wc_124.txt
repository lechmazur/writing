<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s aromatic caution and grief are embodied in trembling fingers and the sealed vial; the memory flashback is anchored to present scent and alters his stance. Seraphae’s brief admission mirrors his flaw, creating relational pressure that steadies him. The final choice—to capture the vapor not to imprison but to study—earns a credible shift with visible cost (tears, coral light). Interiority stays specific, though the epiphany edges close to tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: scent-dense imagery layers toward the Mythiris bloom; the single tightening beat is the inhalation that floods Lysander with memory. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—grief reframed into luminous possibility—charged by the coral shift in lantern moss and the shared tearful laughter. Cost is legible in the unstopped vial and the rewritten city dreams drifting overhead. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered through ultraviolet-lit leaf-script, phosphorescent moss, and opal vapor—details that constrain choice (must wait for bloom) and charge the final image (coral light). Spatial choreography is clean; the iron gate, basin, and drifting petals track without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and light, reflecting Lysander’s profession and wound. Environment actively rewrites itself in response to acceptance, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Lysander confront or avoid the scent-triggered grief? Pressure tightens as the fern’s veins clear and vapor rises; agency is the deliberate inhalation and later the unstopping of the vial. Cost is felt in the tearful memory and the irreversible shift in how lanterns will be forged. No external antagonist needed; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of grief as the vessel of farewell rather than its source; no moral is stated. The honeysuckle memory, lantern moss, and perfume vial form a quiet constellation that reweights meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture—Seraphae’s gloves, the shared tears—avoiding therapeutic exposition. Final image of “invisible birdsong” offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “lanterns stored light the way lungs stored air.” Sensory diction stays within Lysander’s aromatic lexicon; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early (“crystal shadows lingered”) and paid off in the closing hush. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; Seraphae’s “I, too, am aromatically cautious” lands as confession, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, or memory without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“molten opal vapor,” “coral as if color itself could console.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional crests. Minor elevated diction (“epiphany,” “reconfigured”) is consistent with the elevated tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing scent-memory science with extinct-plant conservation feels fresh; the Mythiris fern’s single transformative scent is a non-obvious catalyst. Lanterns-as-lungs metaphor is specific to Lysander’s craft and wound. The greenhouse’s ultraviolet inscriptions and coral moss shift are inventions that serve closure rather than ornament. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
