<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the twin’s fatigue-taped smile and the narrator’s palm-burning card anchor contradictory impulses. The final choice—to stitch an exit rather than stay or leave—earns its cost through prior sibling bond and shared “trapped freedom.” Minor slip: the brother’s off-stage research is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting motive clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship folds into mist while the new lily-pad bridge demands ongoing narration—visible cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds; every loop and mirror tightens until the final seam. One micro-drag: “garden bloomed only where sorrow was gentle enough not to ignite” is told, not shown, just before climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The carnival ship’s corridors, mirrors-for-stairs, and ink-lily pads constrain movement and metaphor alike; the emerald card literally glows to guide choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—heat, rust, salt—without tourist clutter. Final ink-pads crystallize the setting as active constraint: they bear only remembered weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue vs abandonment—tightens once the brother offers half the comet-yarn. Escalation is Accumulative: each remembered name sprouts a new labyrinth, raising the cost of staying. The third-option seam is agency-driven and forecloses both earlier choices with felt price: perpetual co-narration to keep the ink solid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as collaborative burden emerges through image, not thesis: seed-motes seeking soil, lily-pads of ink that demand spoken story. The final dawn “widened the cage until walking felt like flight” offers non-literal, earned resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the garden can truly survive without its warden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“calliope whispers drifted…twisting into voices”—with rhythmic control that accelerates down the mirror-stair. POV stays locked; no head-hop. Compression like “trapped freedom again, wearing his face” teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pressure, not ornament. No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor—“comet yarn” vs “tame comets”—but clarity intact. Final image of dawn bleeding across the bay lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: carnival-ship-as-memory-archive, ink-lily bridge requiring live narration, twin as both gardener and scarecrow. Risky structure pays off—mirrors for stairs, ticket-stub curtains—without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>
