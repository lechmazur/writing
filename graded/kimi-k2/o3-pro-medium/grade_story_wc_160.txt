<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her clattering heart, sweat mingling with ash—but the “encrypted compassion” concept is asserted more than dramatized; the final tremble is earned yet the moral ambiguity feels slightly smoothed rather than raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the volcano’s gentler cadence and the chain’s idle click crystallize a new equilibrium with felt cost (Mara’s exhaustion, future vigilance). Causal linkage holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s breathing stones and the chain’s brass constellations constrain every tactical choice; the final exhalation recharges the opening image of steam-hymns, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent eruption while reconciling values—tightens through each gate-opening beat; the price (risk of shattering orchid farms, personal tremor) is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than multi-reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of negotiated coexistence emerges organically from the volcano-engineering metaphor; the final “fresh cartography” image reweights earlier maps without moralizing, though the encrypted-compassion motif edges toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“slyly heartfelt glyphs,” “rose-lit vapor”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure; no POV drift, perceptual signature distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“sparkling dew that hissed back to stone”) risk overwriting yet serve the volcanic sensorium. No loops or scaffold in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fusing geothermal engineering with emotional cryptography feels fresh; the antique chain as both ruler and conductor is a non-obvious synthesis that becomes inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
