<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iona’s interiority is vivid and embodied—salt on lips, calloused hands, chisel pausing for wood’s angle—yet the “timewoven alliances” revelation arrives as external exposition rather than internal contradiction; her final acceptance feels inevitable but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each slide rotation layers density until the final gate crystallizes the pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—time re-tied around villagers—yet the price (Iona’s perpetual service) is stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment, tool, and object interlock: basalt arch constrains entry, lantern slide becomes gate glass, driftwood patterns guide construction. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; violet light and turbine-hum echo internal stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the eras’ emissary—tightens when the lantern demands participation. One deepening: slide projections consume her outline, foreclosing refusal. Cost is legible but lightly dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “scaffold complexity with simplicity” emerges through layered projections and final gate; no moralizing. Final image reweights earlier driftwood and light motifs without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“turbine-hum reverie,” “cursive gestures”—sustained across POV. Compression and elision taught early (“braided hours”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, rhythmic variation, zero loops. Occasional elevated diction (“chronology itself”) fits the accumulative lens. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood sculptor as inter-era diplomat, lantern slide as literal contract. Risky lyric structure pays off in gate image. Transformation test: premise inseparable from Iona’s craft and cove logic.</comment>
