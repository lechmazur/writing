<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her self-to-self debate about staying or leaving, dramatised while she primes the furnace, creates a clear before/after renunciation that charges the final image of her “actively alight” face.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the domed glass she lifts crystallises her shift from silence to commitment, the lens is consistently Causal because every beat tightens the choice to stay, and the cost (abandoning funding & ambivalent silence) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The decrepit station, cobalt sand, melting ice steams and rivulets, and the furnace are all pressed into causal roles—temperature gradients alter tactics during glass cooling, and the lamp-lit bookmark recharges with coordinates in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Primary stake—craft the dome to protect inquiry—escalates as Mira’s choice to stay narrows funding options and ends in domed trust; the crack of funding loss is a visible price; coincidence complicates (ice slab calving) but never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The thawing-heart motif emerges through embodied events: ice calving, glass blooming, and Mira’s own melting of past silence; never stated as theme, yet the final charged Poise fuses landscape, guilt, and hope in the dome’s shimmer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s vivid internal voice—mock-heroic, tightly rhythmic—mirrors her coping mechanism; consistent focalization distills perception, no head-hopping; dramatic narration of “folding tarps” gives the prose a theatrical cadence without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances heat, glass, or internal stakes; metaphors (sunrise in glass) are selective; cadence shifts accelerate under peak beats; prose is clean, information-dense, and rhythmically varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Direct synthesis of glass art and polar thaw to explore thawing grief feels fresh yet inevitable; the bookmark-returning twist—forging a second dome in warm caverns—grows from seed (coordinates) without gimmickry.</comment>
