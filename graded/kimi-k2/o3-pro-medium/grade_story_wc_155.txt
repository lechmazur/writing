<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulse—yearning for joy while fearing remembrance—remains embodied yet understated; the moment her touch unlocks her own child-form lands as credible reconfiguration with felt cost, though interiority skirts a hairline into therapeutic abstraction (“revelation struck like bells”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard’s “maintenance engaged” reweights the initial gloom into earned stasis; causality is intact across lantern → fragment → light-painting sequence and a single transition (orchid-fog to daylight) keeps scope. Cost manifests in the final image of her “trembling with both laughter and tears.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fog, fountain, dead leaves, and orchard trunks function as micro-setting tools that physically shape projection surfaces and constrain choice; final lifting fog re-prices the space without slipping into postcard description, satisfying the 9+ environment-constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>A single, coherent escalation: Lina’s trade-off—risking heartbreak in exchange for reviving communal joy—progressively narrows until she relinquishes anonymity by gifting her light-journal to the fountain, a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-creative-act quietly emerges from each object and choice; ending reweights “glowing journal,” avoiding explicit statement and achieving a non-literal CR that re-prices prior wounds without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Lyric, poetic diction is consistent with Lina’s artist-perceiver lens; occasional ornate phrasing (“pensive mirth pry open her chest like sunrise splitting curtains”) remains within permissible density and avoids unmotivated register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Flow is generally vivid, but stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats flirt with overwriting and mild synonym churn (“pensive mirth,” “joy… flows… veins…”); none obstruct closure but keep it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>The synthesis of light-painting + ancient orchard + digital knowledge network feels fresh, not gimmick; specific detail rescues the concept from familiar post-apocalyptic nostalgia.</comment>
