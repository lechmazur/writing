<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—orderly intuition vs. carnival chaos—drives every beat; the chip’s weight in her jacket crystallizes the cost of protecting family and city. The dual-allegiance tension is embodied, not stated, and the final exhale shows earned endurance with visible price. Minor slip: Tajo’s motives remain off-page, reducing relationship crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (graffiti arrows, loosened boards, skylight entry) tightens options until the mayor’s delay forecloses privatization. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the chip embedded in the dais reconfigures ownership stakes with undeniable social cost. One micro-transition (parade → museum) is legible and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The raft-carnival’s swaying boards, brine scent, and ultraviolet murals constrain tactics: loosened footbridge planks become the distraction, graffiti arrows reroute crowds. The setting is never backdrop; it supplies the heist’s tools and the final council dais that holds the chip. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—stop privatization—escalates through each graffiti layer and drumbeat until the vote is postponed. Agency remains Mira’s: her choice to orchestrate the parade heist narrows options and exacts social risk. Cost is visible in nightly affidavits and clown-drone surveillance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal ownership vs. corporate seizure emerges through the chip’s journey from museum relic to public trust seal. No moralizing; the final image of tourists “deciphering” graffiti offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in ultraviolet arrows and midway lights carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct—carnival argot, harbor-pilot metaphors, sensory tilt. No head-hopping; even Tajo’s dialogue is filtered through Mira’s perception. Rhythm modulates with tension: long sentences during planning, staccato during theft. UV graffiti “humming like tuning forks” is voice-driven, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bunting puckered like a held breath” compresses stakes and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances plot or pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“ancestral title”) fits Mira’s self-aware narrator stance. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as gentrification battleground is fresh; graffiti-as-code transforms a familiar heist into communal ritual. The foundation stone chip repurposes a MacGuffin into legal talisman. Synthesis feels inevitable: paint precedes law. Risky structure (mosaic parade + heist) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
