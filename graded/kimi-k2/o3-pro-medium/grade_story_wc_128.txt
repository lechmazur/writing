<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jonas’s shift from profit-driven to compassion-driven is credible, but interiority stays surface-level; the locket acts as compass but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Mara remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Earned stasis (pledging the fee) carries visible cost yet feels lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “compass” is recalibrated by communal act, cost shown in Jonas’s loosened rigging. Causal chain (misaddressed envelope → search → gathering → hall) holds under hybrid lens. One transition (library to pier) is clean. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Salt-air library, skylight, lantern sway—details filter through Jonas’s cargo-trained eye and charge the final image. Objects (locket, radios, crates) function as micro-settings that constrain choices. No spatial contradictions; sensory selection mirrors urgency. Environment subtly guides the choice to host gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—signaled early. Pressure tightens when Jonas decides to search; cost escalates with public pledge of shipping fee. Coincidence (misaddress) complicates but does not resolve; final narrowing of options (maritime rehearsal hall) is communal, not individual.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges through concrete particulars (radios, backstage tuning) rather than statement. Final image of locket encased in collective signatures reweights earlier motif without moralizing. Subtext in Jonas’s “softened rigging” implies personal cost. Some late sentimentality nudges score down.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Jonas’s perceptual signature—tonnage columns as poetry, “moral compass nudging north.” Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no head-hop. Diction precise, freighted with maritime lexicon. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional poetic overlay (“laughter rose like gulls freed from gravity”) edges toward overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Filter verbs minimal. Final third remains clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cargo broker + backstage violinist + misdelivered locket. Tropes transformed through occupational specificity. Risky communal closure pays off. No derivative echoes. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if Jonas were generic clerk.</comment>
