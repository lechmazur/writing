<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zephra’s phosphorescent skepticism and Lior’s itinerant rain are vivid, but the interior contradiction between logic and companionship is only asserted, not dramatized in a single charged beat; the final “evolution” of skepticism feels summary rather than earned by a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—sanctuary granted with contingent dialogue—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the aurora’s nostalgic ribbons and the ring’s final honeyed-ozone taste crystallize the new civic stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lavender bluff and cedar electorate are rendered with selective sensory density; the ring itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice, but the broader geography remains slightly abstract, preventing full 9-band constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes—coexistence vs exile—tighten through Lior’s mist-canvassing and Zephra’s statistical light; the cost is legible in the creaking cedar verdict, yet the pressure feels more atmospheric than viscerally personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mutual stewardship emerges from rain-reason synthesis without sermon; the final image of “honeyed ozone” reweights the premise quietly, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet coherent; “citrus static” and “storm-metal” teach the taste-pattern early and pay off at closure. Distinct idiom between Zephra’s skeptical glow and Lior’s gentle rain holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“aurora ribbons curling like film”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of forest suffrage, algorithmic weather, and taste-based navigation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; the risk of cosmic civic fantasy lands cleanly without gimmickry.</comment>
