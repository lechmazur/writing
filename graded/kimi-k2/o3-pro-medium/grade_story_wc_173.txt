<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirelle’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “bodily poetic” fingers untangling threads, the hidden name beneath rouge—but the final smile feels slightly under-costed; the city’s transformation is legible, yet her personal price is more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prismatic sky reweights the city’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each snip and echo layers density until the final image crystallizes the new order.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow-muffled acoustics, and prism-lit chamber are vivid and selective; the “frozen vowels” of breath and “looms clicked like distant teeth” anchor POV bias. The setting constrains choice—threads and doors must be untangled, not forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early and tightened through each untangled thread; the final sky forces citizens to hear their own heartbeats as dissent. Cost is visible in the palace’s shaken ministers and Mirelle’s relinquished shears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as complicity, listening as rebellion. The “harvest of echoes” reweights from rumor to civic re-tuning without moralizing; the final invitation to listen offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“quiet drums” of snow, “threads of silk, gold, and memory”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during descent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final prismatic sky.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than clutter. Only minor scaffold—“like crumbs” after “chimed fragments”—slips in, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar fairy-tale bones are transfigured by tactile specificity and political acoustics; the prism sanctuary and echo-harvest feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
