<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ellis’s reticence is embodied in gesture and silence; the contradictory impulse to speak yet hold back peaks when he names the shard “Anchor,” a micro-choice that seals his role as guardian. Interiority is specific and salt-stained, never generic. The final hush he carries away is earned by prior causal chain—protecting the tower costs him the comfort of forgetting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp rekindles, the chain unbroken, and Ellis’s stance crystallizes—he leaves the tower carrying its hush. Causal linkage holds: cairn → protect → sea-glass ritual → restored light. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored in first 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Breakwater, paraffin, salt, lavender, citrus gust—each detail is filtered through Ellis’s sailor bias and tightens the moment. The lantern room itself constrains the ritual space; the brass pedestal and Fresnel ribs become tools of the chain. Final image of the beacon braiding water and sky recharges the green glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep the chain unbroken to hold the dark at bay. Pressure tightens once: the lamp dies, the cairn demands “protect,” the sea-glass must be named. Ellis’s agency—stacking stones, naming the shard—forecloses retreat; cost is the permanent ache he now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety is communal labor, anonymity is guardianship. The sea-glass chain and stacked stones embody the idea without exposition. Final image of the beacon as “greenened promise” offers non-literal resonance—light is both gift and burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is reticent, salt-rough, lyrical only where pressure spikes: “darkness behind it watched, like breath inside someone else's lungs.” Compression taught early (“speaking mostly through the trims of his wake”) and paid off at the end. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Ellis’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job, texture, and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and precise. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under threat, longer cadences in reflection. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar lighthouse-ghost trope into a quiet network of anonymous custodians. The stone-cipher and sea-glass chain feel invented yet inevitable. Risk lies in the lyric compression and reticent protagonist, both fully committed without gimmickry.</comment>
