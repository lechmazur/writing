<comment>Holt’s persona is vivid—obituary writer for the living—but limited micro-choices; his real action is listening and deciding to map healing, creating one key causal beat. Interior contradiction is mostly rhetorical, not embodied, and the final renunciation feels narrated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Situational lens holds: the garden summons is coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization, and closure is a Charged Poise—renunciation of anonymity with a visible cost of keeping her thread. No causality breaks, though the bulk of the obituary itself occurs off-page.</comment>

<comment>The frost-stiff garden anchors early, but its autumn desolation is more backdrop than constraint; only late frost on the bench sharpens the final image. Micro-setting (body/thread) constrains one tactile choice, barely edging past decorative.</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“write my unhealed map”—are introduced early and tighten once, crystallizing in Holt’s promise to weave healing geography. Cost is felt in the final image (thread as compass, not tombstone), but no escalation loop beyond the single tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges gracefully from motif: words as geometry of healing, culminating in a non-literal final reconfiguration where naming is compass. Subtext avoids moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is lush, rhythmic, and character-filtered; perceptual specificity dazzles, but moderate filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt") slightly dull pressure. No head-hopping; Selene’s dialogue is spare yet regal.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is virtuosic—vivid imagery, varied cadence—but occasional metaphor overload in peak beats and scaffold sentences ("painting long bars of copper") trigger minor clarity leaks. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of “living obituary” and healing geography is fresh; however, the Stockholm-syndrome use of colonial metaphor (thread as pulse) treads familiar lyric paths. Freshness resides in the intimate map, not the premise.</comment>
