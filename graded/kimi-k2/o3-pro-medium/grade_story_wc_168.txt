<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s contradictory impulses—stoic caretaker vs. guilt-laden bargainer—surface in the moment he offers Juniper the shard; the interior contradiction is embodied rather than labeled. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: he relinquishes a fragment of his mother’s box, a visible cost that forecloses his prior solitary ritual. Juniper’s arrival is the crucible; their shared silence alters Rowan’s stewardship of innocence. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “bargained innocence” that edges toward diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Rowan’s bargain is renegotiated from solitary guilt to shared stewardship; the porcelain shard handed to Juniper is the charged image. Causal linkage holds—her arrival tightens the ritual and forces the choice. Orientation is immediate; moonlit ridge, cracked box, and ash are anchored within the first 120 words. Cost is legible in the shard transfer and the space left for Juniper’s future drawings.</comment>

<comment>The moonlit ridge, wind-bent pine, and porcelain box form a micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the pine’s exposed roots are the altar, the box’s fracture glows under moonlight to cue the timing. Sensory hierarchy is Rowan’s—charcoal scent, pine needles, cooling scars—filtered through firefighter priorities. Weather is still, letting celestial motion serve as the ticking clock. The setting evolves when the shard is removed, altering the box’s future capacity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: translating personal pain into bearable meaning. Escalation occurs when Juniper’s arrival forces Rowan to test his theory on a living witness; the shard transfer is the tightening beat that forecloses solitary mourning. Agency is Rowan’s—he chooses inclusion over isolation. Cost is the literal fracture of the last intact keepsake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from ash and shard: creation survives destruction by changing shape. Subtext resides in the silence between Rowan and Juniper and in the shard’s dual edge—sharp enough to remember, smooth enough to imagine. The final image of the shard pressed to Juniper’s heart offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. The only minor echo is the phrase “translate pain into a universal language,” which flirts with thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is gravel-edged yet moss-tender, consistent with Rowan’s hard-soft diction. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses under the girl’s arrival, mirroring emotional shift. Perceptual signature is firefighter-specific: “green flame,” “ropey scars,” “charcoal scent.” No POV leakage; Juniper’s interiority is inferred through gesture and Rowan’s filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each image does double duty—“broken frost” glaze on porcelain also signals fragility. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped beats when Juniper appears. No loops or scaffold; even repeated “ash” gains new weight. Metaphors stay coherent: moonlight as milk over ink, scars as cartography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The firefighter’s post-burn ritual with a child survivor is familiar territory, yet the cracked porcelain box as vessel for “bargained innocence” gives it fresh torque. Specificity of detail—green flame, ropey scars, pine-needle altar—grounds the trope. The shard transfer is a non-obvious synthesis of memory and future creation. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
