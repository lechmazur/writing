<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her “eager metronome” heart against her “perceptively calm” face—but the contradiction never forces a micro-choice that costs her; she orchestrates rather than suffers. The townsfolk’s recognition arcs are moving yet external, so the earned change is communal, not personal. Still, her embodied attention to pattern and scent keeps her from abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural plan crystallizes shared grief into collaborative action, cost paid in Lyra’s solitary walk beneath a “sky rinsed disappointingly of stars.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photograph added thickens the emotional weave until the lilac light reweights memory. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender fog and rusted beams are not backdrop; their scent and decay actively draw townsfolk and dictate the lantern’s purple filter, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is exact—photos pinned between beams, bodies moving beneath laundry lines. The setting constrains the gathering and the mural’s future climb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute communal pain into shared masterpiece—is signaled early and tightened when townsfolk rearrange photos, narrowing isolation to collective responsibility. Cost is the ache of recognition and Lyra’s solitary exit. One clear deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges through concrete acts: pinning, tracing, humming. No moralizing; the final image of tomorrow’s paint buckets offers non-literal hope. Subtext in the “rust seemed to pulse in time” quietly links decay to renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“perfumed hush,” “shadowed petals”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the communal song. POV stays locked to Lyra; perceptual signature filters every detail through her pattern-seeking lens. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“rust shedding flakes like confetti blessings.” No loops or scaffold; clarity remains even at peak lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms familiar post-industrial elegy into communal ritual via lavender-scented archive. The photograph-as-constellation device feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of soot-streaked laughter and factory lullaby avoids generic healing narrative.</comment>
