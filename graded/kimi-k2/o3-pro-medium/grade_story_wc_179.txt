<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maro’s paradoxical pacifist-schemer identity is embodied in every micro-choice; Tyra’s cellular surrender is earned through tactile memory and visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the absence of Tyra’s own POV keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Tyra’s release reweights the world for one breath. Causal chain—broken box → haptic memory → grace absorption → external calm—is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the tears that spark wordless music.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s “soundless” hush and liquid halos are not backdrop; they press skin and choice, guiding the cellular transfer. Broken music box serves as micro-setting that constrains the ritual. Only the off-stage “shifting streets” feel sketched rather than lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Tyra’s need to release resentment—tightens through tactile escalation: broken pin → vibration → memory → visible exhalation of grey. Agency remains hers; Maro midwifes. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the grudge that once defined her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release as creative act emerges from image and action, never sermon. Final lullaby too soft “for anger to hear” reweights the entire premise without a moral stated. Complexity is preserved: pacifism still schemes, but only toward gentler births.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and character-bound: “gentleness made the perfect camouflage for strategy.” No head-hop; even Tyra’s interior is accessed through haptic proxy. Compression and elision (“shifting grace shimmered as liquid halos”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective, never clotted. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cellular memory where grudges roosted unseen”) fits Maro’s cerebral bent. One mixed metaphor—“rivers returned…washing charcoal into fertile silt”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses pacifist strategist with cellular forgiveness in a reality-shifting sanctuary; synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Broken music box as conduit of silent lullaby is a risk that pays off. No recognizable template echo.</comment>
