<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poet’s wistful interiority and embodied loneliness anchor his choices; the decision to release the grandmother’s hum is earned by prior grief-work. Secondary characters remain functional, not crucible-level, but the family’s micro-reactions under pressure read true. No unmotivated epiphanies; cost is felt in the poet’s renewed solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: because the poet has bottled voices, therefore he can gift one, therefore the family’s silence cracks. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—song released, poet’s isolation reaffirmed. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One transition (loft to dune) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved dune, salt-torn tapestries, and gull feathers are selective, tactile, and filtered through the poet’s scavenger gaze. The loft’s jar-lined walls constrain movement and frame the final gift. Micro-setting (music box on threshold) charges the closure image. No white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the poet translate loss into balm? Pressure tightens when the family arrives; the release of the hum narrows options to irrevocable gift. Cost is the poet’s own unsoothed ache. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains with the giver.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of trans-generational listening emerges from concrete action—unscrewing a jar, winding a box—not thesis. Final image of the box sliding down the dune reweights earlier solitude into quiet legacy. Subtext in the father’s cracked lullaby avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Poet’s perceptual signature—coins “chinging like distant bells,” sand “freckles”—is consistent and lyric without purple drift. Dialogue is sparse but voice-differentiated: child’s cracked-shell question vs. poet’s sandy humor. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Gray morning light danced as the hum escaped softly” is precise and earned. Rhythm accelerates during jar-opening, breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sound-bottling conceit is fresh yet grounded in scavenger logic. Transformation of carousel wreckage into memory engine feels inevitable. No trope checklist; the grandmother’s hum could not be swapped for any other sound without breaking emotional specificity.</comment>
