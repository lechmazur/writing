<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s fierce protectiveness and Callix’s sonic absolution define choices under pressure; both bear embodied cost when Callix collapses and Mara steadies him with her “rare thaw,” making their motives credible. Interiority is specific—“she felt the coastline breathe easier”—yet the closing dialogue about belief vs evidence flirts with tidy articulation. Status dynamics shift subtly as engineer and acoustician swap authority, each paying in exhaustion. Their renunciation is earned—leaving the relic undisturbed—though secondary raiders remain one-note instruments rather than nuanced stakes.</comment>

<comment>The causal spine is airtight: because Mara fears raids ⇒ therefore adapts sonic barricade ⇒ raiders repelled ⇒ barter price extracted. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—“adapted their steps to the lantern’s rotations”—where both protagonists stand beneath the now-guarded night with paid fatigue and the coast re-imprinted as worth guarding. Spatial anchors arrive early (“launch docked at the drift-ice marina”) and resolve cleanly. Minor drift: the exact mechanics of vibrational filtering remain elided rather than taught before payoff, but the emotional logic sustains without breach.</comment>

<comment>Frozen planks, clinking floes, “crimson water” and the lantern beam all constrain movement and guide tactics—characters thread wires and place tuning forks to the actual physics of ice, salt wind, and elevation. Aurora and apricot sunset refract into the final image, re-weighting protection through literal light. Spatial choreography holds (position of dock, cutter, tower) throughout. Only the subterranean chamber slips into static postcard, but its absence doesn’t break action.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake (sacred relic vs collectors) introduced line 6; pressure crescendos when raiders’ silent cutter knifes the dusk and founders against an invisible wall amplified by their own dissonant hearts. Escalation: failed assault tightens cost for engineers—sonic system consumes Callix’s stamina and leaves both humbled under auroras. No reversal beyond initial success, yet the tightening feels final. “Cost” is visible exhaustion rather than material loss—sufficient for short-form but less visceral than stakes could reach.</comment>

<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Protection versus greed is refracted through the lens of sonic absolution—sound as ethical mirror that judges contrition. Image of returned shame replaces didactic lesson. Subtext of absolution-as-price undercuts triumphant defense, ending with quiet awe rather than moral dictum. Theme emerges without sermon, but final moment edges close to declarative: “evidence rang so clear” rings the thematic bell instead of letting aurora silence speak.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited hovers tightly to Mara, her perceptual signature distinct—“circuit met solfeggio.” Callix’s dialogue is sparse but cadences of a seeker (“seeker of sonic absolution”) without slipping into exposition. Compression creates lyric propulsion—“thunder rippled across the marina like warm thunder”—though at moments the elevated diction drifts mildly out of engineer lexicon under extreme pressure. Voice feels singular and coherent.</comment>

<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sentences coil with compression: “Crusted floes clinked like glassware...” uses fresh yet grounded imagery. Occasional modifier stack (“fleshly ethereal,” “ancestral choreography”) flushes purple but stays within pattern-taught lyric mode. Rhythm accelerates in sync with tightening beats; paragraphs sculpt visual momentum. No boilerplate loops, no paraphrase drag—though “conceptual cost” and “sacred artifact” skim template nouns yet never stall propulsion.</comment>

<comment>Transmuting lighthouse engineering with sonic metaphysics as defense—an inventive yet internally coherent fusion. Raider archetype left untransformed is a minor flaw; their role as greed vector is functional but not re-imagined. Unique inflection hits in the acoustic barrier keyed to contrite hearts, reframing invasion as self-imposed exile. Feels original without gimmickry, anchored in sensory specificity of ice and brass wire.</comment>
