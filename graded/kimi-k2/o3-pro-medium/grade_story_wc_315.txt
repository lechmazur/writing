<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—muscle memory of the buckle, bark biting gloves—yet the final choice to reroute the convoy feels slightly under-motivated; Command’s hesitation is voiced but not fully internalized as a personal cost, so the renunciation lands as competent rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor itself leans south, endorsing her revision, while she clips the buckle—an earned stasis that forecloses sleep and keeps the watcher’s burden alive. Causal chain holds under a situational lens; every beat tightens options until the pass delay crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The nocturnal arbor above clouds is no postcard; its sway and bark bite constrain her balance and timing, while the parachute buckle micro-setting anchors memory and present choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful, though one or two phrases verge on silver-filigree excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust by redirecting convoy—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the revised mountain-pass vector that trades speed for sunrise diplomacy. Cost is visible in her forced vigil and the arbor’s endorsement, not merely declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust-through-pattern emerges organically from action; the final clipped buckle reweights the parachute memory into a quiet vow rather than a moral. No thematic echo in final paragraph—resonance is carried by image, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that notices “silver filigree” veins and “soundless echo” hush. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off; no head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective and rarely muddles causality. One minor loop—“soundless echo” repeated—barely grazes the closure beat, so penalty stays minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The arbor-watcher premise feels fresh, synthesizing aerial recon, arboreal perch, and diplomatic micro-surgery into one coherent frame. Risky lyric elevation is justified by voice and closure; no derivative echo detected.</comment>
