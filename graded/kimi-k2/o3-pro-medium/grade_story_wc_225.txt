<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (brilliance vs mercy) press Rhaun’s choices, cost of self-forgiveness drives the final reversal, and interiority is embodied in fidgeting and tactile work with threads and hedges—exemplary flaw integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Story commits to Causal lens early; each ‘because’ linkage (guilt → seek village → repair tapestry → unlace labyrinth → self-forgiveness) narrows options until closure lands on Earned Stasis with visible cost—village rebirth paid against irreversible prince death.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frost rimmed mudstones, motionless smoke, platinum hedges, and reflected shards all constrain movement and choice, then re-configure meaning at the final image—setting actively shapes ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Rhaun outlive his guilt—tightens through each beat; repairing tapestry/labyrinth reweights stakes toward mercy, culminating in self-renunciation with open cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme (mercy over brilliance) emerges via concrete puzzle solving rather than assertion; tapestry threads and hedge mirrors re-price the moral calculus in final resonance, no moralizing spoken.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close lens maintains stable interiority; compressed lyric sentence patterns serve fidgety mindscape; consistent word choice and syntactic urgency intensify under guilt pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lines do double duty—texture and causation—with clean rhythm, exact diction, and zero loops; only hairline slip (“shimmered without light”) still readable under mirror premise.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen clock village + chess tapestry + self-repair mechanic synthesizes fresh inversion of redemption quest; transformation test passed—substitute other art/form and whole spine collapses.</comment>
