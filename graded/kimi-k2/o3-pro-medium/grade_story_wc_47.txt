<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her quiet proactive stance drives every beat. The contradiction between her need for sanctuary and her invitation to Rowan is dramatized through micro-choices (typing coordinates, handing him the pendant). Rowan’s trembling hands and salt-tears are specific and earned. The final renunciation of isolation is paid for by the garden’s exposure tomorrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers living matter onto dead circuitry, tightening the stake of healing vs. exposure. Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden’s quiet is reconfigured by the certain arrival of cameras, cost felt in Rowan’s tears and Mara’s acceptance. No orientation drift; causality is by pattern and cadence, not plot twists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy servers, dripping LEDs, and fern-canopied cables are not backdrop but active constraint—Rowan must garden with a screwdriver, not code. The amber pendant’s fossil gnat reappears to charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the “honeyed hush” is tasted, not labeled. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can living quiet survive viral noise? Pressure escalates through accretion—each seed planted is another future headline. The single tightening is the inevitable arrival of reporters; no reversal, only deepening. Cost is visible in Rowan’s tears and the garden’s coming exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the graft of life onto data-death; no moral is stated. The fossil gnat’s suspended dream reframes Rowan’s confession as one more trapped witness. Subtext lives in gesture—handing the pendant instead of speaking comfort. Final image of dew rehearsing tomorrow’s constellation offers resonant, non-verbal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression: “chlorophyll hummed…honeyed hush.” POV stays locked to Mara; Rowan’s interiority is shown through body and dialogue. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer breaths in calm. No filter-verb clutter; every noun earns its place.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and consistent—“amberish flakes that smelled faintly of pine.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates during chiseling, softens at sleep. Minor elevation in diction feels voice-motivated, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of servers as moss gardens is fresh and fully inhabited. The viral confession subplot is transformed into quiet horticultural resistance. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure. Specificity—fossil gnat, Ethernet ferns—anchors universals. No derivative echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
