<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the cyclical spontaneity trait is dramatized through synesthetic tunnel-weaving and the final renunciation. The withheld-truth motive drives every beat, and the sister’s hologram crystallizes the cost of exile. Micro-choices (pressing shard, redirecting strands, pocketing it) reveal a hierarchy of values. The only slip is a brief explanatory lull in the hologram speech that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael forecloses discovery to protect the multiverse, with the shard’s scrambled coordinates as visible cost. Causal chain holds—each redirect is motivated by the sister’s warning and the fleet threat. Orientation is anchored early; the lyric drift is taught and paid off. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s grease-stink and blistered ceiling ground the opening; the drifting plasma motes and skeletal gate reprise the bay’s ruin in a new key. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (brine-ozone taste, caramel gravity). The shard itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final redirect. Only the jump-gate mechanics remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—tightens when revelation becomes a burden that could arm a fleet. Escalation is causal: each redirect narrows options until concealment is the only viable tactic. The cost is legible in Kael’s exile and the scrambled gates. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maps are weapons or shields depending on who wields them. The shard’s lullaby reweights from promise to warning. No moralizing; the final image of “safe blanks where tyrants lose direction” resonates without dictating. Subtext in the sister’s sea-salt voice carries unspoken regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and consistent: “helix of perfume,” “gravity tasted like caramel.” Patterned elision (ellipses between universes) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Dialogue is spare and subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. Metaphors are coherent and character-bound. Minor scaffold in the hologram exposition (“breathed sorrow into data”) but it does not obscure causality. Rhythm accelerates during tunnel-weaving and slows for the final stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sensory-cartographer premise is fresh, and the “harvested minds” twist reframes familiar multiverse tropes. The shard’s lullaby motif evolves from lure to lock. Specificity of taste-gravity and brine-ozone makes the concept irreplaceable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
