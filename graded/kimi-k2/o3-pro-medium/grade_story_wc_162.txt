<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is rich, self-contradictory, and embodied; every micro-choice is filtered through loss and hunger with visible stakes. Flap-level resolve controls outcomes, shifts under camera-light, and persists to the earned renunciation—“stand apart so the wind can finish singing.” No stock therapy-speak taints the peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure hinges on the single missing coordinate fragment pulled from a drifting prism; causality is compressed yet legible under an Accumulative lens. Each shard reconfigures meaning, culminating in Mira’s choice to walk the threshold until it no longer needs sanctity—a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The terrace is no backdrop—its prism rays literally carve corridors of light that constrain movement and provide the final map. Every shard is handled: seen, traced, and re-cast into a new maze, tightening or loosening options on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—threshold as sacred space—escalates through one decisive intensification: the prism rewrites the corn blueprint into echoing absences. Mira chooses to outlast the cathedral rather than reclaim it, paying visible relational cost in the closing walkaway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Themes of necessary distance and sacred absence are never asserted; they accumulate through mirrored images of corridors, torn pages, and wind that unfinished. Final image—“echo of deliberate gaps”—offers a reweighted, non-moral answer with persistent conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is razor-tight: selective attention to knots, varnish, and refracted petals reveals a distinctive urban–rural hybrid lexicon. No prose misfires under stress; rhythm tightens as prism shadows reassemble into exit-light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, lyrical economy: every metaphor earns a prism pay-off, no filter-verb flab in peak beats. Read-aloud cadence modulates perfectly between hush and fracture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms corn-maze trauma into a sky-lit ephemeron; fresh synthesis where light becomes corridor and absence rebuilds the maze. Risk pays off: final threshold exchange recharges six earlier motifs in one crystallized breath.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every decision Mira makes—tracing grain, accepting the fragment, choosing to “walk the threshold” rather than enter—drives causality; removing her invalidates the entire closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears early, is gapped by a torn page, and its returned fragment dictates the closing coordinate; forced removal leaves no prop to link sky map to exit light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Necessary distances” governs every beat: corridor spacing in corn, space between Mira and her father, and Arin’s theory are all forced into the same theological rule; absence itself becomes constructive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Feather-like resolve begins gentle but is shown flapping against lack of answers and finally anchors in the closing walkaway; label usage is eschewed in favor of embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Intuit the pattern” names the final pivot: Mira’s fingertip read of the wooden grain yields the threshold revelation that closes the piece; without it, closure blueprints vanish.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Method of grain analysis is signaled—father traced soil maps, Mira repeats it on varnish—directly produces the knot-shaped exit coordinates; swap it and navigation fails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drifting terrace pressures every movement: light beams become corridors, shadows reassemble into exit strategies; static description is zero, every pane is handled and re-angled.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Timeframe “after the butterfly effect” is named but treated more as conceptual backdrop than live countdown; no visible clock alters choices beyond thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to understand “why thresholds feel sacred” is dramatized: Mira’s desire conflicts with the absent father and ends in renunciation when the threshold no longer needs sanctity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fractured hush modulates perfectly: shattered prisms in pastel fade to a resonant silence at the end, tone pivots from surreal collapse to solemn acceptance without leakage.</comment>
