<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—surf “hissing like fading applause,” “tea left too long in sorrow”—and her conjecture loops back to alter tactics. Yet the final choice (gathering glyphs to restore paths) feels slightly abstract; the embodied cost is more shimmer than wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of seeds becomes a map, reweighting the premise that “paths vanish.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer tightens the pattern until the pool’s sunrise reconfigures options with visible, luminous cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>From tideline to geode, every surface is textured and purposeful; the crater glass and mirror pool actively constrain Mira’s method. The iridescent cave’s “frozen fireworks” charge the final image, anchoring the story’s speculative physics in sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why paths disappear—escalates through pattern accumulation rather than reversals. The tightening occurs when glyphs fuse with absence, forcing Mira to risk her harvested memories; the cost is the autumn-sigh of a dissolving glyph, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of memory, loss, and restoration; the final sunrise over the pool offers a non-literal answer to vanished paths. No moralizing—just the quiet assertion that unspoken emotion can devour roads, and that reclamation carries luminous afterglow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature tuned to salt, crystal, and migrating wings. Patterned elision (“cheerful gloom”) is taught early and paid off in the dusk-lit elation of the ending; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional flights—“jellyfish made of vowels”—risk overwriting but stay legible under the lyric contract. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the final cadence breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist and emotion-transliterating glyphs feel fresh, synthesized through Mira’s tactile practice rather than ornament. The migrating siskin’s seeds as map-making device is a risk that pays off, transforming coincidence into inevitability.</comment>
