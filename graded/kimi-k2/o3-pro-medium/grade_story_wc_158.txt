<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mareth’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shell yet answering the postcard—are embodied in trembling hands and glowing vines; the final renunciation of insomnia carries visible cost as the poems “dream on their own.” Interiority is concrete, but the elder-self remains a symbolic projection rather than a second character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: planting the postcard reweights the shell from echo-chamber to cradle of gentle breathing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical return of the lullaby tightens the pattern until silence sings. Cost is legible in the elder’s dissolution and the vines’ permanent occupation of Mareth’s chamber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shell’s calcium moonscape and coral arches are not backdrop but active constraint: its spirals trap sound, its apertures delay exit, and its final phosphorescent vines guide future wanderers. Sensory detail is selective—brine drips, pearly dust, starlit barnacles—each filtering Mareth’s biased perception and charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the war inside her ribs—escalates via the postcard’s invitation and the garden’s demand for blossom armistice. One decisive tightening: planting the postcard forecloses endless insomnia and exacts the price of self-dissolution. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens without external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing pain into beauty emerges through concrete particulars—ink into chlorophyll, wounds into petals—never stated didactically. The final image of the shell breathing with the poet offers a resonant, non-moral answer: silence learns to sing when despair is bartered for color.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably Mareth’s: synesthetic, salt-stung, rhythmically spiraling like the shell itself. Purposeful lyric compression (“reef-shadow joy,” “shyly unstoppable shimmer”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the harmonized lullaby. No head-hopping; even the elder speaks in Mareth’s cadence, reinforcing identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“time…like salted taffy,” “lullaby…minnows of memory”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; final cadence slows into restful syllables without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—an insomniac poet in a sentient shell who mails herself a galaxy postcard—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Familiar tropes of self-meeting and healing garden are transformed through reef-shadow specificity and chlorophyll-starlight alchemy. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
