<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mara’s motivation—why houses feel alive—drives each choice, and her internal contradiction (diagnosis vs compassion) is embodied when she realises the house is merely ‘mute’. Her bow is earned; the earlier hushed blaze and the orris-root warmth mark tangible cost.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands in the image of the door closing like lungs returning to repose—Charged Poise with felt cost. Causal chain (placement→tremor→understanding) is tight; no orientation debt; the drive lens accumulates density toward final restraint.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bay’s predawn hush, the salt-rimmed door and hearth dust operate as active texture; the house’s anatomy becomes the micro-setting that constrains choice. Final alignment of paint chips into ‘delicate scales’ charges the RR image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate the house’s hush into language—intensifies through displacement tests until tremor and gift (wishbone) reweight the option space. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of control: she pockets warmth but leaves the cottage breathing without her.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of placement-as-cure emerges organically from repeated moves, not assertion. The final image reconfigures silence from wound to breathing lung without a moral. No last-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature—“threshold-taste in the light”, “cathedral pillar of silence”—is precise and sustained. Prose modulates from lyric reverie to embodied tremor without register drift. Voice is singular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene urgency; sentences perform multiple jobs while sensory detail stays compressed. Minor over-coining (“wound and warning”) barely distracts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The diagnostic ritual of “break the silence along its natural fracture” is a fresh angle on haunt lore, married to tactile specificity; every familiar element (lonely houses, root memory) is transformed through Mara’s craft lens.</comment>
