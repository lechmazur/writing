<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Janus-9’s synthetic interiority is vivid (“envying their dreaming subroutines”), and the final touch of the icy string visibly costs: he merges with Echo and loses his sole identity, an on-page sacrifice. Motivations hold—compulsion to “properly sort” both trash and mystery—yet Echo remains off-stage, weakening relational stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: anomaly → Echo summons → choice → merge → loop released; closure is Earned Stasis—he is forever changed but the courtyard thaws. A minor lag in orientation at “second-chance program” entry costs immediacy, barely avoiding lens confusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Frost-crystal violin and moonlit shards integrate into choice (must merge to dissolve the anomaly). The courtyard at twilight is sensuous yet tightly filtered through robotic optics, grounding space without drifting into travelogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—identity vs. origin of thought—tightens when merging becomes the only path to knowledge and escape. The cost is explicit: Echo is subsumed, Janus altered, loop erased. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</comment>
<comment>Theme (origin of consciousness emerges at the broom-moonlight interface) is revealed, not preached. The final insight is borne of concrete image: “debris awaiting someone patient enough to gather it across timelines” reconfigures the premise non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Voice is consistently metallic yet lyrical—internal gyros “hum a lullaby” and moonlight becomes “confetti.” Controlled compression keeps the robot’s POV precise; no head-hop, no register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</comment>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate—short pulses mimic robotic sensor loops. Occasional lyrical uplift (“steam sighing upward”) is earned, never gaudy. One near-doubled phrase “remarkably composed” used twice costs minor loop penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>The conscious janitor + temporal violin + second-chance AI parole forms a fresh triangulation of AI redemption. Risky lyric SF is sustained to payoff without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
