<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hollis’s eccentricity is embodied in tactile rituals (scarf, chalk) and a coherent interior contradiction—he seeks stories yet renounces seizure. The final bow to “shelve silence” crystallizes a cost: he forfeits immediate possession for stewardship, earning the quiet that invites creation. Micro-choices (draping scarf, drawing disk, stepping back) reveal a hierarchy valuing custodianship over conquest. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Hollis renounces taking the prose, accepting the cost of indefinite guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of analog memories and hyperbolic chalk lines reweights the stake from acquisition to curation. Causality is intact: each ritual (scarf placement, chalk drawing) enables the corridor’s opening; stepping back seals it. Cost is legible in the final image of reawakened stories “knowing now precisely where they might someday live.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is no postcard; its non-Euclidean shelving and bioluminescent footnotes actively shape Hollis’s tactics. The scarf-as-micro-setting constrains his final choice by storing memories that must be returned to the drawer. Sensory selection (fluorescent half-light, chalk dust like snowfall) is filtered through Hollis’s nocturnal priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stacks to chalk disk to corridor and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the unwritten annex—is signaled early and tightened when the prose refuses to leave until Hollis “learns to shelve silence.” The tightening forecloses seizure as an option, forcing renunciation. Agency remains with Hollis; coincidence (patrons’ arrival) complicates visibility but does not resolve the quest. Cost is visible in his resumed circuit, now freighted with deferred hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creation’s climate is observed solitude, not possession. The scarf’s reprise—locked away after charging memories—reweights the premise from capture to invitation. No moralizing; the final image of breathing unwritten stories offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture (bowing to prose) and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, scientific diction (“Poincaré disk,” “non-Euclidean lines”) fused with poetic cadence. Perceptual signature is Hollis’s—cataloging solitude, measuring desire in decimals. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences during discovery, clipped fragments on return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept (“door of pure sentence structure unfolded like origami verbs”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—expansive in the corridor, tighter on exit. Clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—library annex where stories pre-exist ink—is fresh, synthesized through Hollis’s hyperbolic cartography. Risky structure (lyric accumulative) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity anchors universals: grandmother’s scarf, chalk dust, bioluminescent footnotes. Transformation test: story fails if any element swapped.</comment>
