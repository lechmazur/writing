<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iria’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to employer vs independent plan—are visible in micro-choices (hiding the cylinder, pocketing wax). Flaw-driven mistake: hesitation risks curfew bell. Earned renunciation at closure forecloses revolution path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: presence of crank → gramophone confession → fraudulent charter revelation → choice to conceal. Closure choice alters world state: dynasty remains un-challenged. Time/space anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sepia reading room acts as crucible: draft guides search, copper cage provides cover, hinged fresco hides crank. Micro-setting (gramophone) constrains next move—no handle, no truth. Cost paid in silence of spinning record.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reveal kept vs broadcast. One decisive tightening: winding crank <em>then</em> silencing it narrows options. Agency drives escalation—silence is deliberate decision with visible consequence. Coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from character goal: truth vs revolution’s aftermath. Subtext in harmonic overtones carries ancestral fraud; final image of record spinning silently offers non-literal answer: some histories stay unheard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Free indirect style clean: “bridge of intuition” voiced from Iria’s lexicon. Dialogue absent but monologue natural and specific. Perceptual signature: tremors, drafts, humming wires all POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose dense with sensory metaphor—braille ridges, caged thunder—without overwriting. Patterned elision of plot steps trusts reader. Rhythm mirrors winding crank tension; final silence paragraph earns poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresco-hidden crank is fresh angle on archive-heist plot. Specificity: mechanical sun keyed by child visual, pigment divorce. Risk choice—to conceal truth—heightens stakes without gimmicks.</comment>
