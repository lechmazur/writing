<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—protective hope against personal grief—drive every micro-choice. The button hand-off crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes the talisman that once steadied her own exit from care. Jordan’s minimal page-time still registers as individual, not type. Only the slight over-articulation of “tactfully hopeful” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s transfer reweights both past and future, with Mara’s “first suture” as felt cost. Causal chain holds—dust pattern → folder → button → delivery—without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. One minor ellipsis (how Fulton is persuaded) is covered by the earned emotional authority of the scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room’s iron-and-paper atmosphere is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail; the button itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Rain and flickering bulbs echo interior states without overt symbolism. Only the transitional complex feels sketched rather than lived-in, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the button before Jordan ages out—is signaled early and tightened by the one-week review deadline. Escalation is causal: each beat (dust circle, note, director, ride) narrows Mara’s options until the hand-off forecloses her possession. Cost is legible in her relinquishment and Jordan’s murmured enlistment pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “unknown histories” emerges organically from the button’s journey; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image—two shadows lengthening—offers a non-literal answer about inheritance and forward motion. Subtext in Jordan’s “restoration corps” line reframes military legacy without exposition. Complexity is honored; sentimentality avoided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in bureaucratic diction (“bureaucratic blinds,” “parliamentary authority”). Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but authentic; Jordan’s hoodie-curtain and murmured line carry subtext. Only occasional elevated phrasing (“ancestral sorrow could become ballast”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Metaphors are precise (“pulse kicked like a runaway stamp”). No loops or scaffold detected. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor (“suture tighten across her heart”) is forgiven under lyrical license.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The foster-archive frame and dust-divination method feel fresh, not gimmick; the WWI button as time-bridge is specific and irreplicable. Transformation test: swapping any element breaks the emotional logic. Risk in blending bureaucratic realism with lyric mysticism pays off in the final image.</comment>
