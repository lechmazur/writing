<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to “harvest lessons”—are embodied in micro-choices (touching the blank, flexing inner rhythm). Her decision to leave the sculpture forever unfinished is earned by the crystallized-time encounter and carries visible cost: she trades completion for ongoing companionship with absence. Interiority is specific, tactile, and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “reverence for circus tent poles,” which momentarily dilutes embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the half-formed lion reweights the entire premise—grief becomes a living, iterative practice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten until the kettle’s overdue scream marks the decisive shift. Causality holds: the crystallized-time beat directly enables the wood to “exhale sawdust,” and that act forecloses finishing the piece. Cost is legible in the line “absence, too, can roar.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The loft’s rain-beaded skylight, kettle, and ash blank function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the kettle’s boil sets the temporal frame, the skylight’s frozen drops enable the crystallized-time step, and the blank literally receives the lion’s roar. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“linseed, sawdust, faint musk”). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The setting evolves with the storm lightening, mirroring Mara’s internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with perpetual absence—tightens through the crystallized-time beat: Mara must choose between freezing memory or letting it flow into art. Agency is renunciation: she refuses completion, paying the price of endless revisitation. Pressure escalates via density and cadence rather than external events; the kettle’s overdue scream marks the irreversible turn. Cost is felt in the unfinished lion and the phrase “absence, too, can roar.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as iterative sculpture—never finished, only paused. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (touching the carving, leaving a stroke missing). The “here and gone” motif constrains tactics in crystallized time and resonates in the closing whisper. No thematic drift; complexity is embraced in the paradox of stillness that echoes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“drops froze…steam paused”). Perceptual signature is widow-specific: circus canvas musk, sawdust breath, the husband’s remembered arm. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Non-standard grammar (fragments, ellipses) is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is absent, appropriate to the solitary scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (“ash pale as unspoken confession”). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Minor elevated diction (“prismatic and still”) is earned by lyric mode. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The circus-widow-sculptor synthesis feels fresh; the crystallized-time device transforms familiar grief into a non-obvious practice. Specific details (African dusk in sawdust) anchor universals. The refusal to finish the sculpture is a bold structural choice that heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
