<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Milo’s curiosity and vocational compulsion are consistent (“broken-clock tinkerer”), yet his final decision to smash the compass lacks visible emotional cost anchored in prior contradiction; the interiority feels more lyrical than crucible-tight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands (“smash the compass, scatter rose and sand”) as an earned renunciation: Milo chooses wonder over records. Drive lens holds situational-pressure; choices crystallive under accretive uncertainty, cost reweights admiral’s archive as failed containment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The burnt-out conservatory, soot-blueprints, sand-streaming hourglass, and hidden vault each constrain moment-to-moment navigation, grounding every pivot in tactile specificity without decorative clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Uncertain-versus-certain tension is the explicit stake; pressure tightens as each clue forecloses alternate routes until Milo’s decisive renunciation. Cost is not revisited post-smash—a hair short of full visceral payment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty is driven entirely by event and image rather than statement, culminating in a quiet reconfiguration of the “tick that never tocks” into freestyled future time.</comment>

<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Prose is distinctive and sensory, with controlled diction and rhythmic compression; no filter paralysis, no register drift, POV consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Clean ear, high information density, vivid selective detail—light over-writing in some metaphors (“sketching rainbow ghosts”) but no loop or scaffold intrusion that blurs cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of broken clocks-as-time-archives and subterranean rehearsal vault; tropes feel freshly embodied. No rule-break or late gimmick sustains intrigue.</comment>
