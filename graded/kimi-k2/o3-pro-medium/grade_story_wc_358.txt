<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her contradictory impulse to “cultivate foresight in action” vs. the need to scramble the wind is embodied in the final act of broadcasting randomized gusts. The cost—leaving the second patch as warning and sealing the star-shaped cavity—lands on the page. No stock phrasing; her perceptual signature is consistent. Minor: the mentor line is a brief reflective fragment within BRR allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the null spot fractures, the convergence is broken, and the port returns to normal wind—felt cost in the thunderclap and the chair sealed with tape. Drive lens is Causal: each beat (survey → find patch → discover star → scramble wind) tightens options until the final act forecloses further extraction. Orientation is anchored by line 3. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop; its geometry channels wind and literally shapes Mara’s tactics—she climbs it for readings and hides behind doors. The “origami precision” of imploded steel constrains her final sealing act. Sensory detail is selective and urgent. One micro-setting object—the anemometer—functions as extension of setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the convergence from returning. Pressure escalates from eerie silence to the null spot to the thunderclap that rolls outward. Mara’s agency is decisive: she scrambles the wind vectors, paying with the permanent alteration of the airflow and the town’s altered future. Cost is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ethics of harvesting momentum vs. preserving unpredictability. Subtext lives in the spiral patch mirroring the vortex and in the silence that “drummed louder than any siren.” Final image of the sealed chair and second patch offers non-literal warning without moralizing. Complexity lingers: extraction may still return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and profession-driven: “hazy precision,” “air remembered accidents.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during the scramble. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mara. Compression and patterned elision (“Singular convergence, she whispered”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“steel folded like paper”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. Clean mechanics and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological forensics meets cargo-cult extraction ritual. The spiral patch as calibration beacon and the wind as harvested resource are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky structural choice—no dialogue, pure sensorium—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passed: story fails if any element is generic-swapped.</comment>
