<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s drive is coherent—her escape from Director Havel is both emotional and professional—and her interiority is precise (“record…forged signature”). Yet her single on-page beat with the worker lacks contradiction or interior friction; gratitude feels too neat for high-band characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A clear Causal lens: flooded tunnel → lantern activation → ledgers → public exposure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—chaos’s “receipts” are paid in public scrutiny—rendered in the last paragraph with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rain-slick pavement, wet-iron air, submerged brick chamber are viscerally selective. Subway architecture actively constrains movement under the mesh gate and arch, linking place to the final choice. Good micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evidence against Havel—is declared early, intensifies with the worker’s confession, and tightens when the ledgers are recovered. One clear reversal: the lantern reveals the hidden chamber. Cost is social; felt, though not visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme—accountability versus expedient sacrifice—emerges through ledger ink “like bruises” and reverberates via morning news. Subtext avoids sermon. Final resonance from “vigilance must flow” offers quiet Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct, clipped detective cadence with sensory immediacy (“wet iron and hesitant electricity”). POV remains tight; psychic distance compresses under stress. Micro choices under pressure sustain the texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is crisp, propulsive, nearly loop-free. Occasional elevated metaphor (“history exhaled”) is earned by context, not excessive. Rhythm modulates naturally across beats. Only slight tautology in “dull to ordinary brass” prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing historic lantern, drowned tunnel, and spreadsheets of preventable deaths feels unlikely but coherent. The synthesis is fresh: archival evil made wet steel. However, once the beat is learned, the twist becomes legible in hindsight without additional shadings.</comment>
