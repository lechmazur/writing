<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene’s hunger for unfinished beauty is embodied in every micro-choice—bowing to the sapling, slicing nets with violin strings—yet the interior contradiction (preserve vs. release) is more asserted than dramatized in real time. The final renunciation—leaving the bowl—carries visible cost and seals her stance, but the family-bonfire backstory is slightly over-allotted, softening present-tense urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (smoke, hush, water, hull-groan) thickens until the sapling’s whistle reweights the entire acoustic field. Closure is a Charged Poise—the greenhouse “did not drown,” the hush now hosts new music—cost is the relinquished bowl and the still-unfinished chord. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with shipwreck ribs is not backdrop but instrument: hulls echo harmonics, water depth dictates wading choices, glass panes trap the sapling. Micro-setting (floating crate, algae-stained pane) constrains the rescue and charges the final image of lantern-lit wrecks. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound before sight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve hidden music from silence—tightens when each acoustic test reveals the sapling’s imprisonment. Agency is continuous: whispering story, slicing net, retuning strings; each act narrows options and raises physical cost (ruined strings, rising tide). No external coincidence resolves; the final note is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-incompletion emerges through concrete acts: unfinished chord released, imperfect hull-groans left unpolished. Final image of dusk-lit wrecks reweights the premise—silence is no longer absence but resonant potential. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the sapling’s “promise.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors listening: long sentences swell, fragments punctuate discovery. Perceptual signature is acoustically biased—“echoes folded back,” “droplets carried a note.” No POV drift; diction stays salt-stung and wind-worn. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each image does double duty (“rusted ribs of hulls like broken harps”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“magnificent simplicity”) is voice-motivated and brief. Final cadence slows to match tide-rise without slackening clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-fire soundscape archaeology via violin acoustics. The greenhouse-orchard-shipwreck triad feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk—using violin strings as saw—pays off in new chord and earned cost. No derivative echoes; the premise could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
