<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aarik’s barefoot ache, shard-listening, and final collective utterance embody “gentle radical” without label-speak; interior contradiction (forge-blade purpose vs. unarmed body) stays active in scene. Rima’s “warm coldness” is shown once, then asserted; her emotional ledger remains off-page, so relationship crucible is only half-forged. Micro-choice chain (kneel, place shard, speak echo) earns the renaming cost; retrocognitive flaw constrains and enables the climax. Still, secondary pressure from Rima is thin, capping excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: mosaic placements progressively retune wind-whistle, pattern break at “Solaryn” declaration delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—city’s scars renamed, future path foreclosed to old name. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. Causality is poetic but coherent: each tessera placement thickens ambient density until name ruptures sky. Closure beat is on-page, cost legible (“sparks settled into the stepping stone”), persistent constraint implied by healed veins. Minor slack: Rima’s late-introduced agency could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plaza, ash, cracked minaret, and stepping-stone mosaic filter through Aarik’s retrocognitive sense; every tactile detail (barefoot on cracks, glaze half-peeled) constrains his empathy-forge ethic. Body-as-setting and tessera-as-tool both charge the final image when shard is pocketed beside his heart. Selective sensory economy—no tourist catalog—yet “shattered sky” silver-vein shift feels slightly convenient, not earned by prior physics. Otherwise spatial choreography clean; weather (wind, ash) directly modulates sound-experiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can aberrant mercy rename a burned city? Pressure tightens through each tessera placement that audibly alters wind, deepening the wager—failure would silence the chord. No antagonist needed; retrocognitive overload and civic grief supply coherent pressure. Final utterance forecloses retreat to old identity, cost felt in stone-sparks fusion. Escalation is single-curve, not multi-reversal, sufficient for 700-word lyric arc; Rima’s emotional stake could sharpen midpoint risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: scarred glass → sound → new name, arguing that empathy must be alloyed in fire, not soft. No moralizing final sentence; last image of “hinges” vs. walls reconfigures meaning without thesis. Aberant mercy’s contradiction (steel/heart) stays unresolved, offering productive ambiguity. Subtext in wind’s changing pitch carries the ethical claim more than any character speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Aarik’s retrocognitive sensorium; perceptual signature vivid (“voices caught in the tiny glass”). Rhythm modulates: longer hypnotic clauses for retrocognitive dives, then hammer-short “We are Solaryn.” No head-hopping; Rima’s interior accessed only through gesture and voice timbre, maintaining distance. Occasional elevated diction (“ocher light,” “aberrant mercy”) fits mythic register and is taught early. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“We built hinges”), distinct from narrative cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high yet purposeful; each figurative line advances atmosphere or stakes, no mixed metaphors. Varied sentence openings, strong verbs (“trembled,” “forge,” “cradle”). One scaffold spot—“sparks of blue light rose…swirling”—is stock phrasing, but occurs pre-closure, not in final beat. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm supports incantatory effect without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of retrocognitive grief, mosaic acoustics, and civic renaming feels fresh yet inevitable; not a trope checklist. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with audible pattern taught early. Specific detail (half-peeled glaze, copper lamps) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—sonic-mosaic mechanic is integral. Slight proximity to “naming = destiny” fantasy convention, but subordinated to post-war empathy ethic, so originality sustains.</comment>
