<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Len’s interiority is richly embodied (“fiercely meditative tide”), his micro-choices (tying ribbon, carving wing) align with motive, and the final renunciation (no name, porous stone) carries visible cost. Mira’s mentorship is more spectral device than character, so relationship crucible is thin, but Len’s contradiction—seeking collective shape yet refusing closure—earns the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the porous wing reweights grief from containment to continuation. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; each ribbon knot and poem shard layers toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse dusk, migrating butterflies, and chisel-stone texture constrain Len’s choices and charge the final image. Selective sensory detail (violet dusk, condensation on glass) filters through Len’s artisan gaze; spatial choreography remains coherent across weeks-long montage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render collective grief honestly—tightens as each ribbon knot accumulates voices. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-accumulative. Final carving narrows options to porous form; cost is the irrevocable exposure of private sorrow to public continuation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as migratory, porous, communal. Subtext in ribbon knots, butterfly wings, and dinner poems braids lament and hope without moralizing. Final line “For everything that leaves, stay” reweights premise via Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric compression (“stone like lullabies,” “thundering calm”) sustains meditative cadence. POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but voice-driven; Harrah’s rain poem and Len’s Dickinson echo their sibling idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift. Metaphors (butterflies as commas) serve rather than stall momentum. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spectral mentorship + migratory butterflies + communal memorial stone. Familiar tropes (ghost mentor, grief monument) are transformed through artisan specificity and porous form. Risk-taking in non-causal accumulative structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
