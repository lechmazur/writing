<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quillan’s meticulous nature is embodied in every micro-choice—counting, tuning, sealing—yet the interior contradiction (order vs. the unmeasured vow) is dramatized only in the final beats; earlier reflection is summary. The cost of retrieving the vow is felt, but the sister’s absence is more asserted than lived, capping emotional depth just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each catalogued detail accretes until the blank ledger space becomes unbearable, forcing projection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the vow archived, guilt re-measured—cost legible in the softened weight inside his chest. One seamless scene, no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop; its quartz hush, rime-veiled shelves, and crystal skylights constrain every motion and echo the risk of frozen memory. The lantern slide and ledger act as micro-settings that literally channel choice. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and climaxes in the snow-applause image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fill the catalog’s void—tightens once when the blank index becomes a “blade at his throat.” Agency is exercised in the decision to project, with the cost of confronting erased love. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals, but internal stakes sharpen decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-measurement emerges organically from Quillan’s vocation and the luminous vow’s recovery. Subtext resides in the unspoken guilt and the archive’s silence. Final image—the glowing ledger entry—offers a non-moralizing answer: some absences can only be archived, not erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, precise, and rhythmically controlled; diction mirrors a mind calibrated to calipers and frequencies. No dialogue, yet the prose carries subtext in every measured noun. Purposeful elision (“hum too fine for ordinary ears”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet lucid; figurative language is patterned (frost, light, quartz) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension—short bursts under pressure, longer coils in reflection. One near-purple phrase (“air within his lungs turn to shards”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The conceit of a skyborne frozen library housing unspoken vows feels inevitable once established. Familiar tropes—magic lantern, lost sibling—are transfigured by the archival frame and the specificity of measurement-as-liturgy. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring stakes.</comment>
