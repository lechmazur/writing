<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Basil’s interiority is vivid and embodied (the velvet silence of absent instants), but his final renunciation—“we must invite them”—feels slightly under-motivated; the communal impulse arrives as stated value rather than demonstrated contradiction. Anika’s pressure is present yet thin; her one line of dialogue carries subtext but no status shift. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with visible cost, but the micro-choice to share the loom lacks prior tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of clues, density of texture, final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the silo glow reweights time from loss to flavor with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by 3rd sentence; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening when the urn fragment steadies the chronometer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald silo’s mineral walls actively dampen temporal turbulence, constraining Basil’s decision to remain; the urn fragment itself becomes micro-setting that recharges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“phosphorescent moss,” “frostless air pulsed”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly down the spiral staircase.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand texture of time before personal supply expires—is signaled early and tightened when the urn steadies the chronometer, foreclosing solitary hoarding. Cost is visible: Basil seals his now-stable chronometer inside the capsule, relinquishing control. Agency drives the final communal choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as braided cloth rather than river. Final image of dates-as-sensation offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in garage-sale clues (“dig where grain remembers lightning”) carries thematic weight. No late thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “sound itself had become suddenly timeless,” “velvet made of absent instants.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; compression taught early (“weeks could shrink to heartbeats”). No POV drift; dialogue minimal but voice-driven. Experimental elision remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops, figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught. “Neon dusk,” “yawn in geology” precise and earned. No register drift. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: garage-sale cryptography + temporal surrealism. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Premise transformed through specific lived detail (moss songs, traffic-light flute). No derivative echoes.</comment>
