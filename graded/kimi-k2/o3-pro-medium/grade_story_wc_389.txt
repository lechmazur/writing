<comment>Orrin's interior motive ("shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is anchored in specific choice: tuning dials, embedding coordinates. Yet Elara as a second character arrives so late the relationship crucible is truncated. The shift from "lonely" to "unlonely" is shown not labeled, but emotional embodiment edges toward abstraction in phrases like "turbines in his chest."</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the static builds as fragments accumulate into murals and migration. Closure at "dawn stepped onto the stage" is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights prior motifs. The cost—surrendering solitude—is legible in the final image. Lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Sky-citadel observatory is a micro-setting that constrains every transmission choice. Sensory filtration (“cloud condensate tea”) keeps the POV’s attention credible. Cobalt panes act as an environmental device; they are later used—charged—when lightning etches the ink. No world-rule violations.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: birth a horizon using old signals. Escalation is accumulative: each fragment tightens the tapestry, her first live song reframes allegiance into migration. Pressure peaks in the final lightning-split storm. Protagonist agency is continuous—broadcasting, rehearsing, guardianship—but external military stakes remain largely off-page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without didacticism: song as sovereignty, prophecy as collective listening. Final line “vision is never solitary once it is sung” reframes “ancient shadows” as collaborative light without moralizing. Subtext in the migration spiral—“mirroring galaxies”—offers layered meaning without forced symbols.</comment>

<comment>Lyric POV sustains storm-drunk diction: “chain-mail lullabies,” “sky rehearsal.” Cadence ripples with thunder pressure. Interiority stays character-bound; register never lapses into expository daylight. Distinct perceptual signature controlled across tempo shifts.</comment>

<comment>Prose moves; minimal scaffold. A single clump “some...some...” line in paragraph 27 borders template cadence but passes the Paragraph Cut Test. Mixed metaphor once (“iron-scaled serpents climbing” vs. “daylight gains traction”) is earned under poetic license. No figurative muddle at climax.</comment>

<comment>Transformation of the prophecy trope: not a chosen child ruling armies but a singer who changes allegiance via broadcast lullaby. The cobalt-glass cathedral window to a future religion is fresh. Risk in tonal alchemy—“grit of storms and whimsy of lullabies”—integrates rather than shatters form.</comment>
