<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s paradoxical blindness to the present is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—pressing the seal to his forehead, dancing in ruinous darkness—so interior contradiction is lived, not declared. The final “second heartbeat” image crystallizes an earned endurance that costs him his remaining sighted time, satisfying the 9+ test. Minor slack: the engineer’s laughter is received knowledge rather than a discovered motive that pressures him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dance re-roots the decaying directive inside the walker, reconfiguring purpose from order to motion with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because he dances, the vines answer, the seal warms, the path re-asserts itself—so lens = Causal. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“vine-draped bunker”) and anchors by 120 words; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bunker’s dripping consoles and swaying vines are not backdrop; they tighten choices—conducting the dance, limiting exits, spearing daylight that guides the final door. Micro-setting (the seal’s coin-wide face) constrains the climactic gesture. Elk silhouetted by lightning charge the closing image with mythic continuity, passing the cost to the next dreamer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the directive outlive memory?”—tightens once: the dance converts passive inheritance into active motion, foreclosing the option of mere custodianship. Cost is legible in the seal’s impending shatter and the narrator’s acceptance of nameless erasure. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no reversal is needed, only the decisive stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox: continuity demands self-expenditure. The final image of elk following an unnamed walker reweights earlier “paths choose their walkers” into a non-literal answer—purpose survives only by being spent. No moral is stated; the cost is felt in the warming, soon-to-shatter seal. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—copper air, “eavesdropping snakes,” baptism by unmade days—rooted in synesthetic impairment. Rhythm accelerates into breathless cadence during the dance, mirroring the protagonist’s surrender to motion. No head-hopping; compression (“history sleeps under moss”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lines multitask: “vines above curl inward like eavesdropping snakes” fuses sensory, emotional, and plot function. No loops or scaffold; figurative language thins during the high-pressure dance, keeping propulsion. Occasional elevated diction (“transient transcendence”) is voice-motivated by the narrator’s oracular stance and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—sightless present, mirrored past/future—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through bioluminescent fungus and rooftop elk rather than borrowed cyber-shamanism. Risky choice to resolve crisis via dance is grounded in the engineer’s test, not gimmick. Transformation test passes: swap any detail and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
