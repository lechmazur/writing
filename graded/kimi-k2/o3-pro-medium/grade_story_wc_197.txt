<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s quiet rebellion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—scavenging the key, tracing the puddle-map, wading into the lagoon—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both fears discovery and steps onto water, a credible leap rooted in prior resourcefulness. The final fusion of memory and flesh carries visible cost: she becomes the archive, voice and heartbeat altered forever. Only a slight excess of reflective summary early on keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lina walks on water, now literally carrying erased voices in her body; the cost is the irreversible occupation of her heartbeat. Causal chain holds—key → kiosk → crystalline spool → embodiment—each step narrowing options until the final image rewrites the city. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3. The lagoon’s rule-change (permission to walk on water) is seeded by the puddle-map and paid off at climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Granite courtyard puddles, rusted tram rails, and the warm, coin-bright lagoon are rendered with selective sensory economy; each setting detail constrains movement or supplies resource (keyhole kiosk, knee-deep water). The amber streetlight constellations and marsh-grass glitter function as micro-setting that guides choice. Only the brief “mothballed circuits” line drifts toward generic tech texture, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased histories—tightens when alarms flash and Lina must choose capture or embodiment. Escalation is causal: each step (key insertion, spool activation, ghost procession) raises the cost of continuation. The final fusion forecloses retreat; the city’s indifference is directly challenged. Cost is visceral—voices now live inside her breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through concrete objects (key, kiosk, lagoon) and embodied action rather than statement. The final image—murals flaring where she inhales—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: remembrance is now a bodily function. No late thematic echo; complexity lingers in the irreversibility of her transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is quiet-archivist precise: “puddle reflections at dusk arranged themselves,” “coded freedom insisting on its own shimmer.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as drones hum. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains consistent. Occasional elevated lyricism (“gilt halos”) edges toward register drift but stays within character’s poetic interiority.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“water warm where city runoff met hidden springs”). Rhythm modulates with urgency—long sentences for approach, clipped fragments during alarm. One mixed metaphor (“melted coins” for moonlit water) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopian archive trope is transformed through the CornerLink relic and puddle-map divination, grounding rebellion in tactile scavenging. The lagoon as living archive feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky embodiment payoff is fully earned; no gimmickry. Specificity of defunct phone company and tram-yard wetlands anchors universals.</comment>
