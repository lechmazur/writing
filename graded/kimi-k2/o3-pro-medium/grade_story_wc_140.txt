<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “death-certificate error” identity is dramatized through micro-choices like pocketing the poison label and slipping it under the container door. Motive—collecting memories—drives every beat. The final renunciation of identity is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: the “ghost” label is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as Charged Poise—the archive’s weave under fingertips reconfigures meaning with visible cost. Causality holds: each fragment gathered tightens the pattern. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One hairline slip: the taped confessions are introduced late yet still feed the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Port labyrinth is rendered through motion and POV bias; turquoise paint drips become navigational breadcrumbs. The poison label and refrigerated container act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy (sound before image) is consistent. Environment charges the final image when the tide rinses footprints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving erased histories—tightens as each fragment risks exposure. Escalation is textural: density of overheard voices and the poison label’s return reweight the cost. Agency is present in the slip-under-door act. One tightening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from the archive-building action. Subtext in the poison label’s “quiet pulse” reweights the near-death past. Final image of the labyrinth rearranging itself offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers: lethal things remember.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature (“sounds arrive first, images later”) governs syntax. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains strictly first-person liminal. Rhythm modulates with tidal cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“moth constellations”—barely grazes clarity. Line-level craft supports the accumulative design without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of bureaucratic undeath is fresh; execution through container-archive is specific and irreplicable. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if label or labyrinth is swapped. No derivative echoes.</comment>
