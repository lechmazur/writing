<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Levin’s guarded curiosity and embodied hesitation (“hesitant footfall,” “shiver”) anchor interiority; the final vow to “ask before it names” crystallizes earned change. Yet the mentor’s cryptic note remains slightly abstract, blunting the cost of the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Levin replaces the grate, letting the stones “resume their guarded silence, now shared rather than stolen.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silence, concealment, and revelation tightens to a charged poise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and henge constrain every move; the grate’s dimensions match the 1963 crates, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“moisture dripped through cracked mortar”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the map by listening to silence—tightens when the coastline vanishes between reels. The final choice to share rather than steal the silence carries visible cost, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartography as empathetic listening. The ear pictogram and the chant of wind through dolmens reweight the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“perceptive map framer,” “shielded openness”—threads every observation. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. The final image crystallizes voice and stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“bitten leaf,” “whispered chapel”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor elevation in diction stays within Levin’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silent archival footage + ancient henge + cartography as listening. The transformation feels inevitable; risk-taking (conceptual chapel, magnetic tape oracle) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
