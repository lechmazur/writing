<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morrow’s skepticism collides with wonder in embodied micro-choices (tracing vapor, kneeling at the grate). His arc from ink to spoken atlas is earned, with the cost of abandoning print legible in the final beat. Interiority stays concrete and profession-specific. Minor: Yara’s status pressure is hinted but not fully leveraged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pool’s whispers reconfigure the atlas from printed to oral, cost paid by Morrow’s surrendered pen. Causal chain—falcon herald → vapor map → buoy grate → font—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. The final heartbeat under the outpost steel crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, and buoy grate are not backdrop; each constrains movement and supplies the literal portal. Condensation on glass becomes micro-setting that dictates the descent path. Sensory economy (loam-thyme mist against frost) is vivid and POV-filtered. The grate’s chain and warming glass charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the river’s origin—tightens when vapor pattern forecloses all but one route beneath the ice. Escalation is causal: each beat (falcon cry → buoy rocking → ice crack) narrows options. Cost is visible: Morrow’s pen fails, memory must carry the burden. No coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus inscription emerges from the conflict, never stated. “Water remembers” reweights the premise in the final pool, making print betrayal palpable. Subtext in Yara’s phrasebook taps and Morrow’s failed ink dramatize the tension. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct dry-witted diction (“subtly confident smile that borrowed warmth from promises not yet broken”) sustains throughout. Compression and patterned elision (“ink bled harmlessly into humid air”) are taught early and paid off. No POV drift; dialogue sparse but subtext-laden. Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “steam hissed… hush pressed closer” does double duty. Metaphors are precise (ice groaned like distant cello). No overwriting under peak pressure. Syntax accelerates during descent, breathes at the pool. Clean mechanics, no artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms cartography quest into mythic memory ritual without cliché. Vapor-as-map and buoy-as-gate feel inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of “fourteen languages: Water remembers” anchors universality. Risk in lyric condensation pattern pays off in closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
