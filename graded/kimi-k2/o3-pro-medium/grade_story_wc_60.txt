<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurin’s skepticism and memory-liberation motive are consistent, embodied in micro-choices (pouring rain through the shard, ringing the bell). Interiority is specific, though the final beat of “doubt blinking off” is slightly abstract. Cost is visible: the geese leave, winter still threatens, and the city’s silence is forever altered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: fountains gush, memories roam, Aurin’s stance crystallizes. Causal chain (breadcrumb → shard → rain → argent key) holds. Orientation is clear by line 3. One minor ellipsis: how the shard “knows” the keyhole is unexplained, but the lyric lens forgives it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>City of dry fountains is vivid, tactile, and constrains tactics: lack of water forces Aurin to summon rain via geese. Micro-settings (catacomb pipes, belfry) are tracked cleanly. Weather and architecture guide every beat; the final mist “kissing balconies” recharges the opening marble basins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate memories before winter—tightens when geese prepare to migrate. Escalation is one deepening: from archival search to active summoning of rain. Cost is felt in irreversible release of voices and the geese’s departure. Agency remains with Aurin; coincidence (rain from wings) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory, doubt, and renewal emerges from concrete events; no moralizing. The final image of fountains speaking and “no map could ever doubt their currents” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in Novara’s whisper and the defiant hush carries ethical ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters everything through Aurin’s skeptical, luminous lens. Syntax modulates with pressure—measured bell rhythm, then breathless descent. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtext-rich. Occasional elevated diction (“sidereal patience”) is earned by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are coherent (“mirrored roses,” “penny wishes surfaced like minnows”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” moment is slightly abstract—but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-fountains, argent-thread fail-safe, rain summoned by geese choreography. Tropes (quest object, mentor) are transformed through sensory specificity and lyrical causality. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
