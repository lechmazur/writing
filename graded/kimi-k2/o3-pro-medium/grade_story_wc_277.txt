<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia’s curiosity-as-vice is vivid, embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the nib, scratching the brass). Interior contradiction—loyalty vs. accountability—drives the climax. The final renunciation (selling the estate) lands with visible cost, though the shift from fear to resolve could be more textured under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage (call → ascent → revelation → vow). Closure is a decisive change—public confession and reparations—with felt cost (loss of ancestral marble). One minor ellipsis: how Felix obtained the carbon copies is elided but doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory above clouds is more than postcard; its echoing stone and half-open dome physically amplify Amelia’s steps and final vow, constraining secrecy. Brass orrery functions as micro-setting that reweights meaning when she scars it with the nib. Sensory economy favors altitude chill and lightning flash over broad vistas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—publish buried floodgate truth—signaled early and escalates through Felix’s evidence. One meaningful tightening: Amelia’s choice to carve the brass groove commits irrevocably, foreclosing denial. Cost is legible in the vow to sell the estate; fear orbiting her resolve adds visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt vs. individual responsibility emerges organically from the orrery’s spinning headlines and Amelia’s tactile intervention. Final image—stars as editors satisfied with a rewritten universe—offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext in Felix’s “theorem” line deepens the ethical calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively observant, cataloguing sensations like typos; syntax modulates from stately (“coattails trembling in the altitude breeze”) to urgent (“scratching a new groove”). No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in Amelia’s biased perception. Dialogue carries subtext—Felix’s reverent mischief vs. Amelia’s dry wit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (storm as flashbulbs, headlines as comets) serve character stakes. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor overwriting in “stars themselves were taking dictation” but it pays off in closure. Rhythm accelerates during the brass-scratching beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Freshens the “heiress confronts legacy” trope via astronomical journalism metaphor and proof-by-contradiction logic. Specificity of the Chronicle’s buried floodgate scandal grounds the premise. Risky altitude setting and orrery-as-confession device feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
