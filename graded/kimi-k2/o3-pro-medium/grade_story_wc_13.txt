<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira’s identity as illustrator-turned-time-sculptor is specific and embodied; tactile handling of stylus and pendant links obsession and craft. Micro-choices (dipping the stylus into borrowed seconds) charge the final renunciation without sentimentality. Internal contradiction—guilt vs imperative—simmers beneath action rather than stated. Closure cost is legible: stylus cracked, pockets emptied, a path closed even as new cadence opens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic lens (Track B) emerges through taught pattern of time-latticed shards converging on the cage; closure lands a resonant reconfiguration—the city’s audible before/after states are inseparable from Eira’s sacrificial release. Causality holds: each exhalation loan is repaid; interrupted cadence becomes the currency paid. Orientation anchors within 120 words yet allows vertical drift. Final double-beat toll reweights all prior moments with felt communal cost.</comment>

<comment>Roof-level canal maze is no backdrop but a dynamic loom that dictates route, timing, and resource depletion. Pendant-pulled corridor and canal corridor are same setting in doubled function—space bends because locale is weaponized. Water spirals, stone cage, and sleeping giant are all tangible, interactive objects. Final auditory bloom relies on the built environment’s acoustic memory to recharge motif.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—liberate the ur-echo vs preserve urban sonic commerce—is established early and tightened stroke by stroke: each borrowed second increases city-wide jeopardy until the cadence’s hiccup erupts. Escalation is accumulative/tactile under the chosen lens: more silence equals more rent to pay. Agency culminates in a decisive irreversible act with palpable toll expressed by cracked stylus and collapsed corridor.</comment>

<comment>The story refrains from naming the theme; instead “every balcony sang” makes freedom inseparable from uncontrolled memory. Echo as communal archive and original loss becomes the lived subtext without meta-commentary. Final line’s uninterrupted flutter replaces moral with sensuous payoff that revalues earlier borrowings. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonates beyond the page.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice layers compressed diction that accelerates with tide (“rain soft as eraser crumbs”). Distinct perceptual signature: illustrator’s language of sketch, charcoal, stroke inflects every thought. Occasional inversion (“slated pages”) feels voice-motivated, never distancing. Rhythm matches heart-drum of borrowed beats; final image retains clarity amid non-linear corridor collapse.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet never overwritten; every clause does work: canal silver threads weave towers at dizzying height collapses three senses into one. Metaphors are integrated weapons (“pockets of warm granular seconds”) not ornament. Zero loops or scaffold; punctuation and time-sense remain crisp even during corridor stretch. Sound imagery persists without mixed physics violations.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>City riding atop a snoring giant plus a rooftop canal transit system is a non-obvious convergence of fantasy logistics treated as civic engineering. The echo itself as prisoner re-weights a familiar acoustic trope into mythic archaeology. Every fantastical rule (borrow sleep-time, dissolve bars with charcoal infinity) is foreshadowed and paid. Synthesis feels inevitable yet utterly specific; no derivative echo survives.</question>
