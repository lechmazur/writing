<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s barefoot vulnerability and “awkward confidence” are embodied in every step; the opera glasses become an extension of her gaze, not a prop. Her interior contradiction—seeking beauty amid ruin—drives each micro-choice down the ladder and back up. The final resolve to carry “music, not weapons” is earned by the stone circle’s visceral re-ordering of her bones. Cost is felt: the lingering hum in her chest is both gift and burden.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (oil, velvet, sparks, hum) thickens until the final image reweights the rebellion itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maris stands at the lip of daylight, opera glasses aimed, satellite answering—options reconfigured, cost legible in the copper horizon. No orientation drift; anchors (spaceport, dawn, ladder) are fixed early and return charged. One seamless scene, one transition (ladder descent/ascent), 740 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s ruptured doors, oily dust, and dead floodlights are not backdrop; they dictate barefoot pain and dictate stealth. The stone circle’s ink-black pillars vibrate, constraining Maris’s stance and later guiding her ascent. Even the satellite’s flick of thrusters is a setting detail that becomes a choice lever. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether the lull will birth war or something else. Pressure tightens when the circle’s hum modulates to her breath, forcing a vision that forecloses weaponry. Cost is the audible thunder topside—collapse or sky remembering—marking the price of her new stance. Agency is hers: she reprograms possibility by sight and sound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between ruin and constellation: meaning is not cleaned but composed from debris. The opera glasses—once chandeliers, now star-maps—embody the reweighting. Final gesture (pointing skyward) answers the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext hums louder than any slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and disciplined: “gravel biting like questions she welcomed” is both sensation and worldview. Syntax modulates with altitude—long breaths underground, clipped urgency topside. No POV leakage; perception stays barefoot and star-fixed. Distinct texture sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image earns its keep (“stalactites of frozen lubricant”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates on the ladder, then crystallizes in the final line. Minor elevation in diction (“nebulae,” “conceptual”) is justified by the stargazer’s inner lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—ruined spaceport, ancient stones—are reforged through barefoot listening and opera-glass astronomy. The synthesis feels inevitable: rebellion reimagined as choreography. Specificity (coolant coils, velvet wrap) anchors the fresh angle. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final satellite wink.</comment>
