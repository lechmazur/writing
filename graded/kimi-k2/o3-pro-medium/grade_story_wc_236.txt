<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between her lost sense and her tactile precision is dramatized in every micro-choice. The moment she “listens to that tiny sound… a way of smelling with her ears” crystallizes her earned shift. Laleh’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters the clamp’s fate. The only minor slip is a touch of therapeutic self-labeling (“nose empty yet heart replete”) that slightly softens the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired clamp and the wounded clock together reweight Amira’s loss into a new perceptual stance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each texture, droplet, and spark layers density until the final cadence shift. Anchors are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the sacrificed clock gear and the irreversible absence of scent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gears, and the brass-scented shop function as micro-setting that constrains every move. The water clock’s sacrificed basin and the clamp’s screw are handled with tactile specificity, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-driven: what Amira can no longer smell she translates into weight, chill, and sound. Weather and interior space evolve causally with the emotional beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Amira’s need to restore meaning after sensory loss—tightens when the clamp’s failure forces her to cannibalize the clock. One meaningful deepening: the act of listening replaces smelling, narrowing her future path. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates. The cost is the irreversible loss of the clock’s original purpose, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between absence and attention: the story revalues perception itself without moralizing. The final image of “drops counting wonders everyone else might miss” offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. Subtext is carried in gesture—the lavender oil bead read by surface tension, not fragrance. Complexity lingers: no tidy redemption for the lost sense, only reconfigured wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; syntax mirrors Amira’s tactile precision (“sparks briefly painting the fogged windows gold”). Perceptual signature is consistent: scent is translated into texture and sound. No POV leakage; knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is spare but subtextual; Laleh’s whisper carries urgency without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and patterned (“gears ticked like gentle raindrops”). No loops or scaffold; lavender-oil bead and screw threads are rendered with concrete specificity. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction is voice-motivated and does not blur causality.</comment>

<comment>Premise—aromatherapist who maps emotion through texture after losing smell—is fresh and specific. The synthesis of water-clock sacrifice to birth-clamp repair feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No derivative echoes; the midwife’s heirloom and the clock’s re-purposing are particular to this world.</comment>
