<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulse—obedience vs. refusal to imprison memories—drives every beat. The final renunciation (tearing the logbook) is foreshadowed by earlier micro-choices and carries visible cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes open forest, the keeper’s role redefined. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of released memories reweights stakes until the mica cracks. Cost is legible in the shattering of the only archive. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse, cathedral of roots, and mica window are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains movement and charges the final image. The mirror-world reveal reconfigures spatial logic without breaking taught rules. Micro-setting (swaddled guide) functions as tool and body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the realm—tightens when the keeper realizes archived memories block the dawn. One decisive escalation: tearing pages to release communal chorus, paying the cost of lost order. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-communal-tissue emerges organically; no moralizing. Final image of “forest open to infinite mornings” reweights earlier claustrophobia without explicit statement. Subtext in the swaddled guide’s mirrored eyes carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: bruised petals, fermented fireflies, thunder about to remember. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hop. Compression and elision taught early and paid off in the choral release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene pressure. No register drift or mixed metaphors. Final chord image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard, crystallized fruit, and woven dawns synthesize into a fresh cosmology. The mirror-world inversion feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
