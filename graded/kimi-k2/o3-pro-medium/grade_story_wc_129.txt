<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alyss’s longing to graft herself into community is embodied in every micro-choice; the ache she feels for the obsidian arbor is specific and visceral. Her final act of weaving reeds into the lattice crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she relinquishes her solitary craft to become “threaded” into collective memory. Lio’s presence is functional but thin; his interiority is filtered through Alyss and never pressures her choice. The earned shift from peripheral to grafted is legible and affecting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor accepts their offerings and records them in mineral flesh, reweighting loneliness into belonging. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each image (reeds, knot, vapor faces) layers density until the final hum reconfigures meaning. The cost—permanent fusion with the orchard’s choir—is felt in the heat/cold braid and the new obsidian shoots. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard is no backdrop; its quartz trunks and frozen sap arches constrain movement and supply the arbor’s lattice. Sensory detail is selective—mirrored dust “ringing like teaspoons”—and filtered through Alyss’s sculptor eye. The crater’s shimmer and dawn angle evolve with the arbor’s activation, charging the final image. Environment, tool (reeds), and body together shape the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loneliness versus communal graft—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when Alyss ties her final knot, foreclosing solitary artistry. Pressure escalates via accumulative imagery: rumor → sight → inscription → apparitions. The cost is the irreversible fusion of self into orchard memory. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and existential, resolved through stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of kinship as living graft emerges through action: reeds woven into stone, strangers into family. The arbor’s inscription—“Offer your thread”—is subtext, not sermon. Final image of interlocked reeds and pencils reweights the premise: art and history become communal tissue. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the orchard’s rising choir.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a sculptor’s tactile lexicon—“marsh-reed sculptor,” “vacant nests,” “mineral flesh.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell, accelerating during the hum. No head-hopping; perception stays anchored to Alyss. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“bottled rain,” “luminescent ache,” “threaded, dedicated.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final paragraph slows into resonant cadence. Minor elevated diction (“communal rootstock”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes mythic orchard, living graffiti, and kinship botany into a fresh whole. The obsidian arbor as Vire-transformed is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity—marsh reeds grafted to stone—anchors universals.</comment>
