<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orielle’s interior contradiction—systematic caretaker vs. foxglove regret—drives every beat; her micro-choice to descend after mending the chime crystallizes the arc with visible cost (abandoning safe routine). Embodied emotion in “glass orchids rustled…cautious bells” grounds her shift. Flaw (regret) complicates rather than decorates. The final smile carries earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (mist, orchid whispers, mirrors) tightens the stake of memory-loss until the restored chime reconfigures the library from archive to living garden. Closure—Earned Stasis—lands with Orielle’s acceptance of perpetual work ahead. Orientation anchored by “opal library above clouds” in first 40 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opal skylight, cloudbone gramophone, and fogged mirrors are not backdrop; they constrain action (light needed for repair, mirrors absorb names). Micro-setting (bamboo chime) doubles as lantern, charging the final descent. Sensory hierarchy (prism scatter, clinking petals) filters through Orielle’s caretaker priorities. Consistent internal logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent memory extinction—intensifies when the corridor opens; descent forces trade-off between safety and reclamation. Pressure escalates via pattern break: silence → song → named voices. Cost legible in “trace of foxglove regret remained.” Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship vs. abandonment emerges through concrete acts: mending, descending, planting names. No moralizing; final image of library as “both archive and garden” reweights premise without statement. Subtext in mirrors regaining mouths carries quiet ethical charge. Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, lyrical yet precise—“mist drifted like torn veils,” “crystalline grooves”—with caretaker’s systematic diction. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments under pressure. Patterned elision (extinct tongues) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“dust into constellations”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors organic to world (cloudbone, glass orchids). Strong verbs—“knitting like dawn closing a wound”—avoid purple drift. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory-bearing glass orchids in sky library feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if relocated: caretaker + song-repair + name-revival is specific to this world. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; no derivative echoes. Bold synthesis earns bonus.</comment>
