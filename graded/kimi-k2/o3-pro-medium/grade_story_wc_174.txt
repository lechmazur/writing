<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s serene composure and ethical drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—inked vouchers, clipped puppet strings, candle tilts—yet the interior contradiction between polished detachment and covert purpose remains more asserted than dramatized until the final renunciation, which lands with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scholars hear their own certainties reversed in the dome’s echo, a conceptual repricing that costs them authority. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bar vignette layers pattern until the final cadence shift reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome, candle-lit proscenium, and drifting moths are selective, sensorily rich, and thematically charged; the dome’s acoustic reversal physically enacts the story’s ethical reversal, constraining the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can ethical storytelling reverse poisoned narratives without trespass—tightens through each puppet show; the final refusal to teach crystallizes stance with visible social cost (scholars’ chastened silence).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: the ethics of illumination via “half-lit” revelation. Subtext lives in gesture—the candle tilt, the stick’s silence—culminating in a resonant, non-moralizing image of meteors braiding dawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, urbane cadence with controlled lyric compression; perceptual signature filters every detail through calligrapher’s eye—vermilion ink, lacquer glint—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the hush of reversed echoes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor scaffold in “meteor hush” repetition is offset by sonic payoff. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Folklore-as-activism via puppet theater in dive bars is fresh; the campfire stick’s memory trope is retooled into an ethical instrument. Specificity of calligraphed virtues and reversed echoes transforms familiar motifs into singular vision.</comment>
