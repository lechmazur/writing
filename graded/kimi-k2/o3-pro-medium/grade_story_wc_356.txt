<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora's olfactory gift is embodied, not labeled (“resinous stories she could nearly read with her nose”), yet her contradiction—ambition vs. reverence—feels slightly muted until the elders’ challenge; her decision to descend and breathe “with expectation exhaling” crystallizes motive, but internal struggle could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is the Conceptual Repricing moment: “the seed had already sprouted inside everyone” with village silence as cost. Causality: because elders fear → Liora moves → flower scent mediates fear, transforming motion into “anchored sway”.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aerosol imagery (resin, orchid, “brackish perfumes”) constrains every stance shift; lanterns become “saplight” that paints caution on elders’ faces. The wrapping-paper floor grounds ritual space; no spatial drift across rope ladders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—portable peace versus village safety—tightens once: elders issue ultimatum → Liora stakes exile → silence settles cost. Agency is clear, escalation singular but earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of stilled motion emerges from Liora’s breathing pattern and the village’s hush; no declarative thesis. Final image—“corpses of yesterday’s fears fertilized tomorrow’s flowers”—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person lyrically filters botanical perception: “wooden bridges exhaled resinous stories.” Rhythm accelerates with pulse-like clauses under dawn, then softens to “wildflower hush.” Voice remains consistent; no head-hop.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh metaphors (“lantern fruits”, “pouch of woven reed, snug against her heartbeat”) avoid cliché; one redundant clause (“so profound that bats…”) but no loop stalls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “corpse flower” trope into a living meditation on migration vs. stillness. Seed becomes metaphor for internal equilibrium; specificity prevents template drift (“dried tears” soil amendment) → fresh but inevitable twist.</comment>
