<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ada’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (certainty vs curiosity) act simultaneously in scene. The hobo nickel and her grandfather’s instruction anchor motive without exposition. Final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost as the city’s fixed murals dissolve into shifting wonder. Minor slip: “methodically playful” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each nested awakening increases density until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise. Closure—“she pocketed the coin, stepped beneath a singing archway, and listened”—crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost: perpetual curiosity, no rest. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop but instrument: every surface returns altered sound that guides Ada’s tactics. Micro-setting (throat-shaped alcove, marble benches) constrains her drumming and whispering. Final mist of unseen images recharges the garden as living medium. Sensory hierarchy favors acoustic over visual, matching POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive dormant acoustics—escalates through each awakening; cost is the city’s forfeiture of fixed meaning. Agency is continuous: each question Ada poses narrows her path toward irreversible curiosity. No coincidence resolves; pressure tightens under Accumulative lens. Felt price legible in citizens’ bewildered wonder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of curiosity over certainty emerges from concrete acts: glazes tuned to frequencies, drumming benches, exhaled riddles. No explicit moralizing; final image of endless questions is non-literal answer. Subtext in echo-responses (“Deep in your waiting”) layers irony. Complexity sustained without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Ada’s synesthetic ear. Syntax modulates with pressure—short pings against stone, elongated pauses before replies. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Distinct diction (“polite gremlins,” “editorial laughter”) avoids ornament for its own sake.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances restoration or revelation. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and patterned. Rhythm mirrors acoustic theme—echoing phrases, mirrored cadences—without monotony. Clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—restoring acoustics by conversing with echoes—is fresh synthesis of art conservation and sound sculpture. Tropes (magic coin, wise grandparent) are transformed through Ada’s material practice. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Specificity of hobo nickel and nested awakenings prevents generic overlay.</comment>
