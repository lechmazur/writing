<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory motives—scientific curiosity versus embodied fear—play out in micro-choices on every floorboard tap and rope length; the final embrace of disappearance carries earned cost visible in her leaving the note and tapping her own requiem down seventy meters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the door composed of silence becomes the decisive last image, its conceptual cost paid by forfeiting surface life; because/therefore linkages tighten each beat from atlas alignment to rope-count descent without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sea-level station, hydrophone, atlas and labyrinth actively constrain tactics: negative elevation readings force the descent, rope marks map depth rings, laminated logbooks dictate route choice; final stone doorway is both literal architecture and metaphorical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The single dominant stake—understanding why paths vanish—escalates through each instrument measurement turning negative, narrowing land access to a single impossible doorway; felt cost is Mara trading terra firma for periodic eternity with no exit visible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Submerged cartography as disappearance, land swallowing itself rather than water rising, reweights childhood promise into adulthood surrender; the final image resists moralising, offering only the quiet certainty that maps themselves can swallow their readers, which feels both personal and planetary.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Consistently atmospheric lyricism modulates cadence with each pressure layer; compressed fragments like “patient library… shelf a pressure layer” teach the reader the pattern, paid off when the door is “assembled from absence”; singular underwater POV never leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from mist-gauze languor to rope-count drum without loss of propulsion; images like “land itself withdrew like a shy organism” carry precise sensory work; no paraphrase loops or elevated diction slippage in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-divestment marine dystopia with surreal negative-space cartography feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the underwater silence-doorway is an image I have not encountered; risk is taken without sacrificing clarity—ocean as archive swallowing its own map.</comment>
