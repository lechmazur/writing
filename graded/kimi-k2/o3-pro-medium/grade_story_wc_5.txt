<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arren’s embodied patience and micro-choices (counting breaths, aligning plate with orchard trunks, pressing sickle to sternum) create a credible interior arc; the final renunciation of counting is earned and carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Backstory fragments (burnt library) are brief and tilt present action. Minor slip: “flash-paper alchemist” label never activated on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard now “whispers of directions” and Arren breathes without counting—visible reconfiguration with cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of frost-map, heartbeat synchrony, and final arrow of twigs reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat advances pattern or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crater orchard is not backdrop but instrument: etched plate aligns with real trunks, frost rivers sketch between scavenged items, branch-tips become star-chart anchors. Micro-setting (rusted sickle, snow-pit) constrains the sealing gesture. Sensory hierarchy (starlight shimmer, frost-lace) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Environment directly shapes final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate heartbeats into maps”—is signaled early and tightened once: the sickle-seal costs Arren his lifelong counting ritual. Pressure grows via pattern completion and heartbeat synchrony; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible: orchard exhales arrow, Arren’s stance loosens. Coincidence absent; escalation is accumulative deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-compass emerges from plate’s etched forest and orchard’s real trunks; no explicit statement. Subtext in “the orchard itself exhaled” reframes stillness as agency. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers: maps are both gift and burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “breathing shimmer of safekept starlight,” “cartographer of blood.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences during stillness, clipped fragments at seal. POV modesty intact; no head-hopping. Compression (“minutes, hours, maybe seasons”) is taught early and paid off. Voice remains singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear: each sentence layers image, action, and emotion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. Strong verbs (“seeped,” “stitched,” “humming”) drive momentum. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous point anchored to a branch-tip”) fits alchemist’s perceptual lens. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: starlight as cartographic ink, orchard as living map, patience as measurable pulse. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode succeeds without obscuring stakes. No derivative echoes; specificity (worm-holed apples, rusted sickle) anchors universals.</comment>
