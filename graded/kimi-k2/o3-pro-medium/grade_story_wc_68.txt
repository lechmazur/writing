<question>1</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Corvin’s interior battle between skepticism and hope is embodied in concrete decisions—his agonizing over the cog and his ultimate climb—while the rare concession of a smile to Mara crystallizes the cost. Flaw: late revelation of earlier shared history is briefly stated rather than dramatized, a minor slip.</comment>

<comment>Holding to the Accumulative/Textural lens, the closing moment in the submerged planetarium reconfigures meaning with a felt cost: both characters relinquish their prior certitudes without neat resolution. The progression from barnacle-orated doubts to mirrored star charts is a cadence shift that tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drowned museum’s lagoon-rotunda, scabbed marble stair, and salt-etched map walls are so vividly particular they serve as second character, constraining every footfall and ultimately projecting the star charts that deliver closure. Tiniest gap: the smell-of-tar waypoint is mentioned once and not re-anchored after ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>A single escalating pressure line—Corvin’s quest to retrieve meaning from salvage vs. Mara’s narrative imperative—tightens through one decisive encounter that narrows options under the Accumulative lens, paid for by their mutual surrender of explanatory control over the cog and city.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The emergent interrogation of how stories and data coexist evolves through the salt-written constellations and the final mirrored sky, offering a non-literal, reweighting answer without moralizing. Each layer accrues meaning rather than states it, resonating long after the page.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a disciplined, iron-ductile texture—Corvin’s “abrasive calm” sanding certainties—that remains consistent when the rhythm tightens under water pressure. Mara’s brief overlap reads distinctively historian, and the final whisper carries echo without convergence distortion. Only microscopic: one sentence (“Each step up...relished the debate”) edges toward author meta-comment.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, salt-limned, each phrase dual-jointed: “algae-filtered dusk” and “mollify certainty with rust” advance atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. Zero loops or scaffolds; every clause propels the reader downward then skyward. Minor alliteration clusters are purposeful, not overwritten.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of drowned-city ruin with philosophical salvage yields a genuinely fresh frame; the chronometer cog and star-projector model vault synthesize prior particulars into a single inevitable closure without gimmick. Risk heightens coherence rather than obscurity, meeting originality under pressure.</comment>
