<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—gripping the parasol tip “like a metronome” and hearing “the edge of endings.” The shift from seeking death to accepting postponed departure is earned through her micro-choices aboard the trawler and the harmonica moment. The only cap is that the foreman remains functional rather than a crucible, keeping relationship pressure off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara postpones the clinic visit, a choice legible in “bearing the quiet weight of postponed departure.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—salvage rhythms and ice-song deepen until they reconfigure her stance. Cost is felt in the final harmonized breath with the ice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: floes “the size of rooftops” constrain navigation, the blizzard traps the crew, and the ice calves’ “throaty crack” becomes the final teacher. The parasol tip doubles as micro-setting, its whistle guiding Mara’s ear to endings. Environment and object together charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens through salvage shifts and the storm lock-in. Agency is attention rather than overt reversal; the blizzard deepens stakes by foreclosing the clinic path. Cost is the quiet forfeiture of scheduled death, visible in her whispered thanks to the cold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: salvage as dialect study of endings, ice as plural-voiced oracle. The final image—ice syllables harmonizing with her breath—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic statement intrudes; meaning accrues through sensory pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “windborne solace drifted around the docks” marries external weather to interior state. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices gulls, prop drones, tar-black coffee with equal weight. No POV leakage; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “snow hissed against corrugated walls while the marina groaned like a tired leviathan.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image and stakes. Figurative language is selective and coherent, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is transformed through sensory apprenticeship to endings; no template plot is followed. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final harmonized breath. Specificity of salvage dialect and ice acoustics makes the concept feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
