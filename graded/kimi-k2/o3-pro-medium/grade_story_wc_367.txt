<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mora’s hunger to shape dawn is embodied in salt-taste and wrist-bone instinct; the final rotation of the wick is a micro-choice that costs her perpetual stewardship. Herald’s laughter skips octaves, but his agency is off-stage, so relationship crucible is thin. Interiority is vivid, yet the herald’s vanishing leaves a motivational vacuum that nicks the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse inhales starlight and emits darkness-as-guidance, with Mora’s calm-tinged-with-electricity as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection tightens the weave until narrative and night fuse. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Emerald prism and salt-wrapped balcony constrain every beat; the tower’s pivot is a spatial reconfiguration that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—metal taste, flickering plans—filtered through Mora’s keeper bias. Weather and architecture evolve with the shadow-map, no static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—shape tomorrow via ancient shadows—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Mora rotates the wick three degrees, foreclosing her freedom. Pressure grows through accumulating reflections; cost is the eternal keeper bond. No coincidence resolves; agency drives escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of story-as-survival-after-print emerges from the herald’s “finish what newspapers began” and the auroral headlines; no moralizing. Final image of countless droplet-lighthouses reweights the premise: guidance is now viral darkness. Complexity lingers without tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-stung, synesthetic, rhythmically controlled—“shadowed elation coursed outward” compresses cause and effect. POV stays locked to Mora; herald’s speech carries jester-thunder diction distinct from her interior cadence. No head-hop; patterned elision (laughter as departing sail) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“lighthouse no longer shone for sailors; it inhaled the starlight”—each line advances map-making or cost. No loops, no mixed metaphors; cadence breathes with storm tempo. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) stays within Mora’s mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dying print culture and viral lighthouse-shadow feels inevitable yet unforeseen; trope of keeper-and-herald is transformed through emerald prism optics. Risk-taking (darkness as guidance) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity—inkless letters, silica storm-memories—anchors universals.</comment>
