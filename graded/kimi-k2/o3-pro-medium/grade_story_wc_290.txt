<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aveline’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in every move—measuring exits, reciting primes, tracing circles with the compass—so her final choice to pocket the key carries earned cost. The internal contradiction (fear vs duty) stays active in scene, not summarized. Minor slip: “wistful rebellion” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridors fold, the nexus seals, and Aveline’s stance crystallizes—“her rebellion had just begun”—with the felt weight of the key in her pocket. Causal chain holds: organ song → spatial mutiny → negotiation → retrieval → resealing. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s narrowing throat, the breathing walls, the star-choked dome—all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“tasted of iron,” “stone throat pressed her shoulders”). The organ’s acoustic architecture is both tool and setting, integrated into every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve key or kingdom starves—tightens once when the cage corkscrews away and Aveline must negotiate with space itself. Agency drives escalation: her geometric diplomacy dilates the tunnel. Cost is visible: she pockets the burden she once considered destroying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</theme><comment>Theme of negotiated rebellion emerges from concrete particulars: spatial mutiny responds to respectful speech, not force. Final image reweights “key” from weapon to guarded responsibility without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the promise “I will guard how it was used.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, tactile, slightly archaic (“spatial mutiny,” “fallow period”)—and stays inside Aveline’s perceptual limits. Syntax tightens under stress: short clauses when panic spikes, longer arcs when she reasons with space. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“stone throat,” “lonely church organ”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Minor cadence repetition in “spatial mutiny” phrase but it patterns early and pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic cartography that literally reshapes architecture. Tropes of hidden map and lost key are transformed through the organ’s sonic physics and Aveline’s geometric negotiation. Risky spatial logic is taught early and held consistently.</comment>
