<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calix’s interiority is vivid—his “incandescent restraint” and trembling patience embody the cost of witnessing future grief. The contradiction between archival duty and personal horror is dramatized when he keeps writing while “his own heartbeat sounded like distant shovels.” The final renunciation—hiding the notepad and rehearsing an ordinary greeting—earns its cost through prior absorption of the town’s fate. One notch below 9.0 because the birth-date whisper feels slightly abstract, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the notepad now “thick with centuries” reweights every prior image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of seasons, textures, and grief layers until the final hush. Causality is intact: the lamp’s hum ceases precisely because Calix finishes mapping the avalanche. Cost is legible in the split bonsai trunks and his stagger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth and cedar desk are not backdrop; their accelerated aging under the prism directly constrains Calix’s ability to endure the vision. Micro-setting—the lamp’s filament, the moss-grazing antennae—grounds the speculative mechanics. Weather and silence evolve causally with the chronal experiment. One hairline slip: “invisible snowdrifts” could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—archiving tomorrow’s avalanche—tightens when Calix chooses to speak the fatal year, trading personal solvency for communal memory. The deepening is a single, decisive intensification: grief refracted into “frostbitten blues.” Cost is visible in the split trunks and his stagger; no reversal, only irrevocable witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the ethics of bearing witness: history is “a loom,” not a river, and Calix’s gathering of “luminous threads” carries irreversible weight. Subtext resides in the mountain’s silence and the townsfolk’s ignorance. Final image—Calix scattering soil over the antennae—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; syntax mirrors Calix’s restraint (“skating under perception”). Perceptual signature is precise—he “listened where others looked.” No POV drift; compression like “thunder butterflies” is taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the avalanche vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“petals scattering like torn ledgers” compresses time and loss. Minor elevation in register (“chronal prism”) is justified by Calix’s vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a stationer who smiths time via fluorescent hum. The bonsai forest as temporal crucible is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—absorbing future grief—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; the premise would collapse if relocated.</comment>
