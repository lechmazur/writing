<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory longing for repair versus fear of failure drives every micro-choice. The apology to her mirrored self crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the living clock’s cadence reweights “repair” from fixing to invitation, with the tear-shaped heart as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mirrored shard and ticking gear layers density until the final swing of the pendulum reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frost-rimed stairs, floating lanterns in quartz, and mirrors that angle reflections into the clock’s face all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the milky radiance and salt-smell memories root us in Selene’s skin. One minor drift: “above clouds” is asserted, not sensed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightened when the prophecy demands a heart from her own failures. The cost is the extracted tear-pendulum and the public apology; these visibly alter her stance. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as invitation rather than imposition. The mechanical rose, drifting books, and mirrored regrets all refract this idea without moralizing. Final image of footsteps keeping “music only she and the mirrors knew” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“breath ghosting like pale ribbons,” “locks not as obstacles but promises.” Syntax mirrors Selene’s meticulous craft; purposeful elision (“she could not swear it was the same one”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional stacked metaphors (“driftwood nostalgia floating beside her like a tide”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative design. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with ascent and descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith, mirrored library above clouds, and clock-heart synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh. The transformation of “repair” from mechanical to relational is non-obvious and earned. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
