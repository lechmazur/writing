<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s irreverent awe and steady curiosity are embodied in every micro-choice—bargaining with acid, whispering jokes, yanking the release cord—so motive stays legible and intensifies. The final laugh that “cuts the night yet mends it” crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost: the bell now sings to things, not people, foreclosing ordinary recognition. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; a deeper clash could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard chord rolls out, reconfiguring the sea and buoys, and Liora’s irreverent awe is charged with new, wistful cost. Causal chain (algorithm → arrow → bell) holds without gaps; orientation anchors by line 3. One tightening beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image—acid calms, buoys answer, human ears remain deaf.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The acid sea, floating workshop, and bell itself constrain every move—acid demands wax cores and corrosion bargains, the swivel mount dictates firing angle. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “ozone and mischief,” “citrus fumes,” “copper halos.” Environment charges the final image when the bell’s unheard note stills the acid, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears yet”—is signaled early and tightened once: the arrow’s release forecloses silence and risks ridicule. Pressure grows via corrosion losses and acid’s appetite; agency drives every beat. Cost is visible in the bell’s exile to inaudible resonance. A second tightening would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of irreverence and awe: machines must sing even when no human listens. The unheard chord reweights earlier images—acid, gears, arrow—into a non-moral parable about risk and wonder. No thematic statement intrudes; resonance is carried by the final image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and compressed: “wheeled wings,” “acid sea fizzed green,” “yearning algorithm hammered into brass rods.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses for the shot, longer sinuous lines for cooling bronze. No head-hopping; POV certainty matches Liora’s limited knowledge. Patterned elision (e.g., “mirrored negatives”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, action, and stakes. Metaphors are precise—“gears tremored like nervous teeth”—and never clog causality. Rhythm accelerates for the arrow release, then exhales with the low chord. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor hairline: “acid dream” edges purple but is earned by prior specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—cart-glider, yearning algorithm, unheard bell—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of inventor and artifact are transformed through irreverent awe and acid-sea stakes. Risky lyric compression heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Specificity anchors the fantastical: electroplated salt vats, wax cores, sulfur light.</comment>
