<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior calculus of “fair trade” is embodied in micro-choices—loosening the glass shard nightly, calculating exchange rates inside the body bag—yet the minister’s ethical objection is sketched more as mouthpiece than crucible, keeping the relational pressure one-sided and capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore linkage from Corvus’s entrance to the glass cut to the incineration ruse. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Mara’s motionless flight forecloses return—with the felt cost of permanent exile legible in the final line “practicing the art of motionless flight.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The prep room’s chemical chill and refrigeration coils are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the cold hides breath, the ink-stained shroud masks blood, the body-bag conveyor unlocks doors. The ink pot’s final placement as “open variable” recharges the setting into conceptual space, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve two integrities”—tightens through each causal beat: forged confession → glass shard → body-bag escape. The visible price (Corvus’s death, Mara’s exile) is unmistakable on the page, and the final image crystallizes the trade-off under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fair exchange” emerges from concrete transactions: forged death certificate vs. real blood signature, asylum vs. exile. The ending’s spectral ledger—“numbers balanced imperfectly”—offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting of the premise without thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and philosophically compressed (“deathly vitality,” “mathematics of fair trade”) without purple drift. Distinct perceptual signature—Mara’s con-artist daughter noticing angles and exchange rates—remains coherent under pressure; no head-hopping or register slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and tactical information. Occasional lyrical compression (“red signature blossomed more honest than any ink”) risks overwriting but is earned by pattern and payoff. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—morgue escape, forged documents—are transformed through the con-artist’s honest child wielding her father’s ink pot as both weapon and ledger. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of a quiet, motionless climax heightens rather than dilutes stakes.</comment>
