<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sereya’s disenchantment-to-abdication arc is embodied in every beat: her nightmares compress to the bleeding starlight, her “softly commanding” voice cracks when she kneels and offers crown back to orb. Riall shifts from captain to pilgrim through single unarmored exhale under fireflies—relationship reframed without speeching it. Internal contradiction—queen/criminal—remains active even in last footstep down ridge. Cost of name-erasement is legible on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as irreversible Charged Poise: queen’s abdication is declared, starlight reverses fall, dawn opens corridor of reordered sky—felt cost on page under Causal lens. Escalation chain (“orb pulsed”—memories unfurl—dripping slows—queen kneels) is causally tight, no teleports, set-ups paid. Only hiccup: “storms lanterns shuddered” is slightly ornamental intrusion at very start, not disruptive.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt grotto never postcard; it compresses queen’s childhood myths and adult guilt into living architecture, constrains final stance, and re-embodies cost. Stalactites “organ pipes,” quivering runes, and reversed droplets all tactilely handled in micro-choice to crown and silence. Spatial choreography flawless: ridge-grotto-balcony transition tracks step-by-step. Image of “fireflies that drifted among the runes” charges last reconciliation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bleeding sky from stolen hope—is signaled in first paragraph and narrows to singular test: bleed to heal. Escalation is single sustained turn: memory bleed→renounce→re-absorb, cost escalating from dream weight to literal crown surrender. No outside coincidence; everything forced by queen’s history on ridge. Micro-cost (abdication, public ruin) visible, slightly more could be felt on step down.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of legitimacy-through-confession refracted through bleeding starlight as conscience. Subtext of siblings’ fracture is carried only in concrete images—orb, smoke of ships, warships’ silence—never named. Last rose-tangerine dawn reconfigures moral rule set: guilt can metabolize into stewardship beyond ruling. No thematic statement; only image and stance create new ethics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is royal yet weather-battered, distinct in selective imagery (marble walls, lacy menace, fireflies in exhale). Free indirect slips seamlessly into dream logic during grotto descent without rupture. Punctuation and fragments (e.g., “crown jangling against stone”) serve cadence; rhythm tightens in pulse sequences. Language never overwrites cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose high-density—each line advances mythic, character, and tension simultaneously (“she realized the starlight bled because she had wounded it”). Minor fig-string “tidal” vs “tide” slightly redundant near queen’s order but negligible, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Transforming classic sibling-coup tropes into oneiric confession; no fantasy ascent cliché because entire climb compresses moral choice into metaphysical surgery. Bleeding starlight as literalized conscience feels inevitable in hindsight. Language freshness in “lacy menace” and “rose and tangerine across the sky” prevents decorative drift. Final reconfiguration risks nothing familiar yet lands earned.</comment>
