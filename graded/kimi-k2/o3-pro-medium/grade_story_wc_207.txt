<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“knees shaking,” “bottled droplet shivers open”), but the final renunciation—stepping through the question-mark doorway—leans more on lyric inevitability than on dramatized internal contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully foreshadowed by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust, grease, mist, silver droplet) tightens the cadence toward the final Charged Poise. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—surrender of collected memories and self-definition—on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and pressure-driven; the lagoon’s stillness and marble platform constrain the final step. One minor spatial drift: the skiff is “folding” yet never shown being unfolded, a hairline slip that does not mar the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—escalates via sensory density and compass tremors. The tightening is one continuous deepening rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the release of every bottled memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the collector becomes the collected. The final question-mark doorway offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights the entire premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—petrichor as memory currency, compass as heartbeat—maintained under lyric compression. No head-hopping; diction stays within the narrator’s eccentric lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only one minor loop (“hinged awakenings” twice in close succession) and no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in the breath-held final sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of subterranean discovery into a sensory-mnemonic exchange; the petrichor-collector premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
