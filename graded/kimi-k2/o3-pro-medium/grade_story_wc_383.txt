<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (archive vs consume, self-protect vs embrace loss) push every beat; her embodied skepticism, yearning, and grief collide in the final choice to carry the brother’s shell onward. The internal conflict scales with pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal line holds: because she enters with doubt, therefore listens, therefore confronts memory, therefore chooses integration over abandonment. Closure effect—deciding not to leave memory quarantined—lands on the page with a conceptual and emotional cost (final line “less like an ending… still writing its score”).</comment>

<comment>Garden body functions as constraint: hedges seal behind her, fountain silence cues exit; the seashell-as-setting recharges final image. Sensory economy balances velvet dusk, moonlit marble, and soft light comet-spiral, all tied to the choice moment.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carry vs abandon quarantined love—is signaled early and escalates via the revealed brother’s sacrifice. One tightening choice (“she spoke aloud… carrying him forward”) closes a live option, forging agency under visible pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—transforming isolation into independence without severing love—arises from the precise event chain; no thematic statements intrude. Resonant reconfiguration in the final paragraph reframes the central image without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is vivid—velvet garden, moonlit veins, “ribbon of unexamined yearning”—yet never flinches from interiority. Syntax modulates with stakes; lyric diction remains under character control and pays off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density without excess: figurative leaps serve purpose; no looped stock phrases. Near misses: “tragically radiant” and “poignantly cold” risk purple, but rhythm supports pressure; no clarity lost at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Garden-as-archive for quarantined memory feels fresh; resonant reprise avoids familiar trope exhaustion. The risk-taking (lyric surreal pressure) heightens coherence rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
