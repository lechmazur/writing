<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—loyalty to former masters vs revenge—remains embodied in micro-choices (dancing to open vault yet also teaching it mercy), culminating in a renunciation foreclosing her past with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each danced step intensifies exposure risk; final collapse broadcasts cost while the lab’s death forecloses data return. Closure reconfigures meaning with salt-lung triumph paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Algae-slick stair, petal vault, ghost-green plankton—selective, concrete, immersive; yet no singular setting element physically constrains the final choice toward 9+ gate. Room, tide, and decay mirror rather than impede Lira.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake—liberation of secrets and self—tightens with each sabotage beat. No reversals needed; pressure escalates under chosen lens, culminating in on-page data exfiltration and lab implosion. Cost is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encoded vulnerability threaded from dice to dance emerges through action alone; final image reweights silence as strength without moralizing, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade><comment>Percussive internal rhythm, lyrical filter, distinct perceptual signature remain controlled under pressure; non-standard syntax is taught early and paid off in closure, satisfying voice and elision.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid diction, zero loops, seamless integration of action, setting, and line-level propulsion. All figurative language serves immediate stakes; no muddle or register drift interferes.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptographic dance, hangman’s dice, and underwater espionage; premise and voice are singular and non-transferable, with every detail grounded in lived circumstance.</comment>
