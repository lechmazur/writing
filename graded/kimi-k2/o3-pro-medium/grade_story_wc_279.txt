<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Felicity’s interiority is vivid—her “socially perceptive” gaze and chalk-as-language choices reveal layered motives. Yet the supporting trio remain sketches: the boy’s tile-flake tic is evocative but never pressures choice, the scholar and fisherman serve as thematic mirrors rather than crucibles. The earned renunciation (tidying tables) is credible, but the cost is diffuse across the group rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mandala’s final image of the kitchen table reweights the premise from cosmic quest to domestic reordering, a Conceptual Repricing with felt social cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the spiral pattern accumulates meaning until the pattern break reframes stakes. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s mineral breath and lilac dust are tactile constraints that guide Felicity’s micro-choices; the mist and salt air mirror the emergent hush. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the mandala. The kitchen table image at closure recharges the earlier domestic crumbs, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—tightens when the mandala shifts from prophecy to table-clearing. The deepening is driven by Felicity’s chalk intervention, not coincidence. Cost is legible but diffuse; the collective lightness feels shared rather than personally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is not in grand riddles but in the courage to reorganize daily clutter. Subtext resides in silence and chalk geometry; the final image reframes prior material without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—whose table?—yet feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-bound: “seaside glass” eyes, “fragrant bloom of lilac unease.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays Felicity’s. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“shy ribbon,” “laughing tides”) are precise and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at the iris moment, longer breaths in aftermath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chalk-mandala-as-oracle conceit is fresh; transforming cosmic quest into kitchen-table epiphany feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without gimmickry. Specificity of tile flake, lilac dust, and reversed clocks roots the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
