<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—contradictory impulses to salvage instruments vs. tend the greenhouse—grounds every beat; the moment she maps the dust trail to the trench and chooses shovel over clipboard, her renunciation of “needless drama” is earned and costs her colleague’s approval. Embodied emotion (mud sucking at boots, fingertip on vine) keeps interiority concrete. Only slight over-articulation in the final line keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the drained trench and unfurling seedlings crystallize the new stance—listening to “slow instructions.” Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dust pattern tightens the texture until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is visible in Jonah pocketing the demolition form. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken panes, silted trench, and drifting wing-scales constrain every choice; the trench’s drainage literally enables the ending. Sensory selection (brackish reflections, tomato-stalk scent) is filtered through Mara’s scientific gaze. Micro-setting—the dust trail on the bench—functions as map and compass, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“strip needless drama from recovery”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must choose between protocol (raze) and gradual repair. The dust trail deepens the stakes by revealing hidden capillary action; the shovel choice narrows options and incurs social cost. Escalation is one steady intensification under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges through the fractal dust patterns and the seedlings’ slow unfurling; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in gesture—Jonah smudging the trail, pocketing the form. Final image of the river’s “gentle persistence” reweights the premise without abstraction. Slight thematic echo in Mara’s last line is earned, not preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from cosmic vocabulary (“neutron star crusts”) to tactile immediacy (“mud sucking at boots”). Free indirect style stays coherent; no head-hop. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Jonah’s mutter vs. Mara’s gentle correction. Final cadence slows to match the “quiet enough to hear” resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea (“dust…like interstellar grains”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Strategic telling compresses the flood aftermath without stall. Rhythm accelerates during shoveling, then exhales at twilight. Minor elevated diction (“kindled humility”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics and horticulture feels inevitable; the neutron-star lens on butterfly dust is fresh yet grounded. The greenhouse as micro-lab for cosmic principles is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky quiet ending pays off by reconfiguring stakes without spectacle. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
