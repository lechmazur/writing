<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity is embodied in the quartz-petal anemometer and the microclimate log; her internal conflict—listen vs. alarm—drives every beat. The final switch-flick is earned by prior data and carries visible cost (trust vs. lives). Minor: “credibly curious” is once label-adjacent but immediately dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each pressure dip tightens the choice until the switch act reconfigures stakes. Closure is a decisive change (balanced chord released) with felt cost—Mara’s creed bent to save towns. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary’s copper spires, frost, and bell rope are not backdrop; they constrain (rope forbids metal peals) and charge the final lone chime. Micro-setting (quartz petals, console needle) likewise shapes tactics. One minor spatial blur: “thin iron ladder to the crown” could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—false-alarm vs. missed storm—escalates via pressure graph plunges and skin-static countdown. One meaningful tightening: the green light margin collapses, forcing the switch. Cost is legible in the mellow chord that risks credibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mindful sound” emerges from the tension between silence and warning; the final lone bell reweights earlier alarms as gratitude, not panic. No moralizing; resonance arises from the storm’s harmony with the instrument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, sensorial, and vocationally shaded (“stratified squalls corkscrewing”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under hail, longer breaths in hush. No POV leakage; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“clouds churned beneath like gray oceans”) and never muddles causality. One near-loop: “listening over noise” appears twice but serves thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-siren ethics reframed through microclimate craft and musical alarm. The quartz-petal anemometer and tonal warning feel inevitable yet new. No derivative echoes; risk-taking (mellow chord) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
