<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; Talitha’s guilt and scientific lens feel specific. The final choice—sending the polymer swans—earns its cost through prior beats. The absence of Mara on-page limits relationship-as-crucible pressure, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of separation/reconnection tightens through river foam, chrysalis, and swans. Closure lands as Charged Poise—river carries both apology and minerals downstream—felt cost legible in “lighter” ascent. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-desert ravine is sensuously anchored and braided basalt pillars echo polymer chains. River foam constrains the insight that drives the final act. Micro-setting (chrysalis, snag charcoal) doubles as tool and symbol, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing rupture with Mara—intensifies via guilt and river lesson. One tightening beat: foam insight → polymer swans. Cost is forfeiture of remaining grant material and emotional exposure of the text to Mara.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of separation as prerequisite to connection emerges organically from polymer science and river dynamics. Final image of swans dissolving into coral rebirth reweights earlier guilt without moralizing. Subtext in coded chemical apology is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is symphonic, precise, and consistent under pressure—“metronome tapping regret,” “tympanic core of Earth.” No head-hopping; scientific diction stays within Talitha’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern without clutter. Minor scaffold (“river lingered… river cut… river foamed”) is purposeful, not redundant. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer chemistry, marine grief, and river morphology feels inevitable and fresh. Swans-as-apology/mineral-delivery is a non-obvious synthesis that could not swap settings. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
