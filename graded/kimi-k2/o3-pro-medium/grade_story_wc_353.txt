<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s interiority is embodied and specific—his breathing mirrors the grove’s silence, his charcoal fingers read stone pulses. The final renunciation of speech after the performance is earned by the prior empathic labor and carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the valley’s “infinitely fuller” hush reconfigures meaning with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each micro-gesture layers density until the final harmonic dissolves. No orientation debt; causality is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The siskin alder grove, porcelain insulator, and cracked wing sculpture constrain every tactical choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the moss-swathed plinth and trembling alder trunks function as micro-setting that alters resonance. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—creating music in silence—is signaled early and tightened through each empathic micro-choice. The final harmonic forecloses further striving; cost is legible in the cooled, glowing insulator and Lark’s wordless bow. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy rendered audible emerges organically from Lark’s tactile listening and the grove’s response. The ending’s non-literal answer—“the valley itself was humming within”—reweights all prior material without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the living hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—“symphonically minded skull,” “fractures like spider maps.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (“nearly imperceptible, a fingertip brushing dust”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or resonance. Figurative language is sparse and exact—“murmured like distant surf.” High information density with read-aloud rhythm; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—sculpting music from fracture and empathy—is fresh and fully committed. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The porcelain insulator’s reuse and the stone wings’ sonic transformation feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
