<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's invisibility motif and cataloguing compulsion are embodied through tactile beats (copper wire, muslin bag) and a late micro-choice to surrender anonymity for the student's sake; the contradiction between lifelong concealment and sudden partial revelation is legible on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the dweller’s choice to remain unseen yet leave tangible evidence re-sequences the night's events and forecloses full visibility; blackout duration acts as coherent pressure, outage resolves externally but leaves lasting conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Library's ribcage architecture (ducts, copper, oak panel) is concrete and tactile, used for route-finding and induced-charge device; dawn's sapphire hue and emergency diodes supply both illumination and temporal anchor; environment constrains the rescue crawl and final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remaining unseen yet helpful—spikes once when the student sees the flicker-silhouette; cost is emotional (permanent partial exposure) but physical stakes never escalate beyond a charged phone screen; tightening is singular yet meaningful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-circuitry emerges through the stash, tape shard's failed oxide, and newly added notes; final image of ‘magnetized night for whoever needs light’ offers non-moral resonance; avoids explicit summation via concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct—crawl-space idiom ('slow clocks', 'library's ribs') and technical intimacy (shortwave magnet, induced charge) mark lived expertise; tone modulates from spectral hush to pulse-long glow without voice slippage or head-hop artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured and dense ('ink inside transparent water') yet occasionally overwritten within single beats; repetitive stems ('blue', 'sapphire') and slight scaffold near midpoint slow momentum, none corrupting visibility of the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Gentle, luminous caretaker inside the ventilation skeleton feels fresh; reframes campus ghost trope through engineering tenderness; synthesis hinges on invisible altruist who restores both archive memories and human voltage, specific to this university anatomy.</comment>
