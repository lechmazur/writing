<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ira’s contradictory impulses—power-hunger vs. self-erasure—are embodied in each droplet she edits; the final renunciation of tyrant-selves is earned by the cumulative cost of erased timelines, felt in the hush after the ripple.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Ira rewrites the rule-set of her own existence, paying with the extinction of countless selves; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each droplet’s deletion tightens the final pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The viaduct’s breathing arches and suspended rainlake physically constrain her edits; the tablet’s blankness at the end recharges the opening glow, now internalized, anchoring the reconfigured reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—self-recomposition—tightens when droplet-by-droplet deletion forecloses every tyrant future; the price is the howls of discarded Iras, audible behind the bricks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative genocide of alternate selves; the final image of Ira “almost but not quite touching the ground” wordlessly answers the labyrinth question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“darkening brightness,” “gravity remembered her again”—with rhythmic control that escalates under pressure; no head-hopping, consistent perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: every sentence advances image or stakes; metaphors stay coherent, no register drift; final blank tablet is a clean, resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: procedural-generation-as-memory-editor, gravity-defiance as moral choice; the risk of timeline genocide pays off in the earned stasis of a single humbled self.</comment>
