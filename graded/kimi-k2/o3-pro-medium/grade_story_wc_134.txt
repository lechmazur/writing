<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arden’s “compass of small marvels” and Mara’s missed prophecy create clear, contradictory motives that collide at the pearl; their micro-choices (whistling, card slap) reveal interior stakes. The final renunciation—leaving the pearl—earns its cost because both have glimpsed what possession would steal. Interiority is embodied (“cupped the glowing sphere that hummed against his pulse”) rather than labeled. Only the reflected doubles feel generic, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl is set down, wonder redefined as shared, not owned. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each musical echo layers density until the chamber’s luminous shadow reweights meaning. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the doubles’ threat dissolves almost instantly, softening the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cave’s ringing stones and silver pool are not backdrop but active agents that constrain tactics—Arden soaks his sleeves, Mara follows veins of light. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“molten brass,” “nervous teeth”). Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the pool and reflections. The cave’s rule-set (music translates perception) remains consistent and learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: who may carry wonder out. Pressure tightens when reflections attempt to inhabit flesh; the card compass reorients Mara from pearl to person. Cost is visible—Arden’s soaked sleeves, Mara’s shaken cards, the pearl’s dimmed glow. Agency drives the climax; coincidence only complicates. One escalation beat suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wonder is not property but witness. The pearl’s final dimming reweights the opening itch into communal stewardship without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—setting the pearl down speaks louder than any creed. The closing daylight that “rang like night” offers a non-literal, resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntax flexes with pressure (“colors rang, scents chimed”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Arden’s musical synesthesia, Mara’s card cartography. No head-hopping; POV remains third-limited, cleanly alternating attention. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Mara’s single spoken name reorients the chamber.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise and mutually reinforcing (“molten brass,” “sheets of black glass”). No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with tension. One near-purple line—“textures wrote staves of silent symphonies”—is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The musical crystal cave and pearl are familiar fantasy tropes, but the inversion—renunciation as climax—feels fresh. Specificity of sensory translation (“how water might taste light”) grounds the concept. The synthesis of missed prophecy and magnifying witness creates a non-obvious angle. Risk is moderate; no gimmicks, but also no radical departure.</comment>
