<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet choosing solitary migration—is embodied in the tactile hum threading her wrists and the final slide of starlight. The reincarnation memory supplies motive without overt exposition, and her micro-choice to tip the sundial costs her the safety of the floating library. Flaw: the glyptodon poets remain off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s descent on a beam of starlight reweights “isolation into independence” with visible forfeiture of her sky haven. Causal chain—sundial directive → basement hum → migration choice—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor drift: the library’s tilt is asserted rather than shown to narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal library’s rocking marble aisles and mist-threaded footsteps are selective, sensuous, and tied to choice: the sundial’s reflective slide literally carves the descent path. Micro-setting (brass sundial, kelp-bound scrolls) constrains packing decisions. Only the stone circle’s pre-wind claim edges toward exposition rather than lived texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate isolation into independence”—is signaled early and tightened when the sundial verbs foreclose lingering. The cost is the library itself, abandoned mid-tilt. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification (mist thickens, verbs condense) rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: glyptodon extinction, salt-shared memory, and the final migration refract solitude into communal resilience without moralizing. The closing image of “libraries among people” reweights prior isolation without stating a thesis. Only the phrase “brittle awakenings” flirts with thematic label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“dews followed a lunar rhythm,” “shard angles”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during descent. Compression (“satchel bulged like a heart granted extra ventricles”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the starlight slide. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“sugar glass dawn,” “manuscripts rustling like palm fronds.” No loops or scaffold; minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating tidal library, glyptodon poets, and starlight migration synthesize into a singular vision; the premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
