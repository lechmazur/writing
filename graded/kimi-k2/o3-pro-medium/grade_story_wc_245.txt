<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oriole’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertip reading of moss, the ring warming “like dawn cupped in metal.” The final renunciation (slipping the ring into the pool) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “maps inked in sorrow but bordered by tenderness” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint is redefined as an internal coordinate, the ring dissolves, and braille constellations freeze in air—cost is legible and irreversible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sensory absorption → melody completion → spatial opening. No causality breaks; every beat advances texture or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop; its trembling refusal to finish the song directly pressures Oriole’s tactic of turning the languages inward. Micro-setting (root, spruce, fern) constrains her path and charges the final image. One minor drift: “across the pause of shifting constellations” is atmospheric but not spatially anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting the stillpoint to guide lost pilgrims—tightens once when Oriole realizes it is an internal coordinate, foreclosing the external mapping project. Cost is the dissolution of the inherited ring and the shift from route to resonance. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, consistent with Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through shared stillness emerges from concrete particulars: glacier patience, rain regret, tectonic grief. Final image of “braille constellations” offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature of a blind mapmaker who “tastes vibrations” remains consistent. Compression and elision (“languages thick as summer honey”) are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; syntax modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. One paraphrase loop—“the forest quivered… as though afraid its heart would fracture”—could trim, yet rhythm serves the beat. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a blind mapmaker charting emotional stillpoints via skin-absorbed languages is fresh and fully committed. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—plot collapses if Oriole is sighted or the ring points north.</comment>
