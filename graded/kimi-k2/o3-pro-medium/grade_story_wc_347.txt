<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied through micro-choices—pocketing the nut, pruning rot, guiding miners—each action revealing layered motives. Internal contradiction surfaces when her “hidden vow” clashes with her claim of not being a hero, culminating in the Earned Stasis of silent return. The cost—exhaustion, secrecy, and the orchard’s unspoken debt—is visible and scaled to the word count. Minor slip: the miners’ gratitude feels generic, blurring status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: amber resin, mechanical birds, and blueprint fragments layer until the final amber-lit model reconfigures the maze. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stones sigh into terraces, birds perch peacefully—cost paid in frost-risk and Liora’s anonymity. Causality holds: every object and impulse seeds the ending. One hairline lapse: the nut’s overnight opening is elided without micro-choice cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard, resin-oozing pears, brass gulls, and salt-rust corridors are filtered through Liora’s wary gaze, each detail constraining her path. The mechanical birds’ glass eyes and saw-toothed wings become active obstacles, not set dressing. Final image of birds on sunset rails recharges the opening dread into guardianship. Spatial choreography is tight; only the labyrinth’s exact layout remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent another lost soul—tightens as frost crystals form; the amber model becomes the single tool to rewrite corridors. Escalation is accumulative: resin lines, twig arrows, nut-shell gears build pressure until the socket click. Cost is the irreversible exposure of her secret craft and the orchard’s silence. No reversals beyond the decisive reconfiguration, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet guardianship emerges from resin, gears, and footsteps; no moralizing intrudes. The orchard’s “brief kindness” reweights earlier curse rumors into a tacit covenant. Subtext lives in Liora’s refusal to claim credit and the empty nut shells she pockets—husks that once held a map home. Final resonance avoids tidy binaries: safety harvested, power left untasted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and restrained: “amber resin,” “graceless beauty,” “offhandedly exact”—phrases that feel born of orchard labor. Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off in the amber model’s shimmer. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Liora’s wary interiority. Mechanical birds’ creaking wings and ticking gears provide rhythmic counterpoint without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Resin hardens into lines, twigs knot into arrows” compresses action and image. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors stay coherent—amber light dazzling optic lenses—without purple drift. Minor tick: “graceless beauty” repeats twice; the second instance feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchard caretaker, mechanical birds, and dream-blueprint into a quiet reconfiguration of a cursed space feels fresh yet inevitable. The nut-shell map and “leaving impressions without touching” are specific inventions that would collapse if swapped. Risk lies in the lyric, almost mythic tone sustained without gimmickry. One near-echo: mechanical birds recall familiar steampunk tropes, but their optic-dazzling payoff transforms the cliché.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Reluctance seeds early, drives the hidden vow, and culminates in silent return—cost paid in anonymity.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Nut rolls, glows, opens, yields blueprint fragments, then becomes shell-reminder—three beats, closure linkage.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Forgotten blueprint is literally reassembled from nut fragments; shapes maze reconfiguration and final path.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>“Offhandedly exact” enables socket placement and dazzle maneuver; cost is exhaustion and secrecy.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Assemble action spans resin lines, twig arrows, nut-shell gears—irreplaceable process that rewrites maze.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Method seeded in dream, practiced in orchard, deployed to stall birds—mechanics matter, not late gimmick.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Labyrinth and birds pressure every move; final alignment turns them from threats to guardians—causal setting.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Frost deadline is signaled early, tracked by crystal formation, and forces the twilight socket insertion.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Guiding lost travelers is hidden vow, tested by miners’ rescue, paid for with anonymity—friction visible.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Graceless beauty threads through resin knots, twig arrows, and final orchard kindness—tone modulates with pressure.</question>
