<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pearl’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (honor vs. impermanence) act simultaneously in the knot-tying beat. The final renunciation—letting the structures crumble—earns its cost through prior causality and the monarch’s aureole. Minor slip: “esoteric realist” is label-speak early on, but it’s quickly overwritten by action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cadence mends, the ribbon straightens, and Pearl pockets the re-woven rhythm. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lichen arch and moth-wing reflection layers density until the final hush reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the grotto’s “blushing stillness” and the vanishing aureole.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s emerald amphitheater and cloud-fed pool constrain every move; the moss-veined walls literally guide Pearl’s placement of the mnemonic knot. Final image—the lingering aureole—charges the setting itself as transient witness. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the monarchs’ route by mending the forgotten story—tightens once when the interrupted cadence stalls mid-flight. Pearl’s agency drives escalation: from weaving signals to slicing moonlight for the knot. Cost crystallizes in the grotto’s settling hush and the butterfly’s solitary farewell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges through the midwife’s recovered vigil, not exposition. Final aureole reweights the premise: transient memory outshines permanent monuments. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “transiently rooted.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Pearl’s esoteric lens (“tasted that interrupted cadence on the back of her tongue”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during knot-tying, longer breaths at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Minor elevated diction (“mnemonic hinge”) fits Pearl’s lexicon and pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: monarch migration as living ribbon of memory, midwife erased from song, grotto as floating archive. Risky lyric structure holds coherence; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative echoes.</comment>
