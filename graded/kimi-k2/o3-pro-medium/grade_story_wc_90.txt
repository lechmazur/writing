<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Griffin’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between grief and nonviolence is dramatized through the nightly “Action” and the final self-forgiveness. The silhouettes function as pressure rather than characters, so relationship crucible is waived. The Earned Stasis—he forgives himself for surviving—pays the cost in buoyant weightlessness, foreclosing any return to the recycled ship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the frost gate opens only after Griffin’s self-forgiveness, reweighting the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shimmer of tears and knot of sorrow layers density until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in the irreversible abandonment of the ship and the silhouettes’ dissolution into song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship’s rhombus corridors and jury-rigged hull constrain movement and echo past wars; the airlock frost gate becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (ventilation hum, temple-bell chime, scent of rain) is filtered through Griffin’s pacifist attention. The bead and frost together constrain the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens when Griffin realizes dimensions respond only to undamaged emotion. Each nightly stitching session escalates pressure by exposing fresh grief; the final self-forgiveness is the decisive trade-off that forecloses return. Cost is visible in the silhouettes’ dissolution and the ship’s sealed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: nonviolence as a living practice that metabolizes history’s violence. The silhouettes’ transformation into song and the gate of frost reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image—seed accepting water—offers resonant, non-literal answer to how new life begins after extinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is Griffin’s pacifist filtering of every sensation. Syntax mirrors buoyancy: longer floating sentences when weightless, compressed fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Griffin’s embodied attention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (tears → frost → gate). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“opalescent dusk”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-human pacifist stitching war-ghosts into a new dimension—is fresh synthesis of Buddhist and sci-fi tropes. Risky buoyancy-as-emotional-state is fully committed and paid off. Final transformation of silhouettes into song feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
