<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lowell’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet hiding—drives every beat; the ledger choice crystallizes his arc with visible cost (renouncing perpetual retreat). Empathy is embodied (ear to shutter, tears on mirrored page) rather than labeled. Only the attendant’s minimal presence keeps relationship pressure off-stage, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lowell refuses eternal refuge, accepting stewardship above ground with the cost of exposure. Causal chain—invitation → descent → ledger → vow—holds without gaps; the mirrored pages reweight regret into doorway. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Watchmaker shop, rain-slick streets, and lantern-lit library anchor place and mood; the indigo ledger becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective (polished streets mirror silhouette) and filtered through Lowell’s hushed attention. No object or environment charges the final image beyond the ledger itself, capping at 8.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain hidden or carry wisdom outward—is signaled early and tightened when stewardship is offered. The single reversal (choosing daylight exposure) carries felt cost (loss of safe obscurity). Pressure coheres under causal lens; coincidence (own signature) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassion for imperfection emerges organically from Lowell’s astronomical error and the library’s mirrored failures. Final image—Lowell writing annotations that will descend again—offers non-literal answer: wisdom grows by sharing cracks. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct hushed, empathetic perceptual signature sustained throughout; syntax mirrors Lowell’s whispered interiority. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet prose texture remains singular and purposeful. Compression and elision (e.g., “library folded like moth’s wings”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“lanterns whose flames copied the cadence of breathing”). No loops or scaffold; high information density. Minor elevated diction (“nestled paradoxes”) fits the library’s register without drifting from Lowell’s voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: secret society archiving astronomical miscalculations as luminous maps. Transformation of regret into communal wisdom feels inevitable. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost; no derivative echoes.</comment>
