<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mina’s interiority is vivid—her “practiced delicacy” with headphones, the “ozone and coffee” breath—yet the moment she reroutes the transmitter her contradictory hope/resolve crystallizes with visible cost (Calvin neutralized, auroras celebratory). The only gap: Calvin’s opportunism is sketched more by label than by embodied pressure, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (signal → decode → counter-broadcast) links because/therefore, culminating in a decisive inversion that folds the tricksters’ rhythm back on itself. Closure lands on-page—“the university radio station hummed a quiet victory chord”—with felt cost (Calvin slumped, unity bought by secrecy).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The booth’s “blinking red LEDs like candles in a crypt” and the idle subwoofers at the amphitheater are not mere scenery; they supply the literal tools Mina weaponizes. Micro-setting (mixing board, antenna) constrains every tactical move, charging the final auroral image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic tricksters from feeding on division—tightens once: Mina’s subsonic counter-signal forecloses Calvin’s exploitative broadcast and unifies the campus. Cost is legible (Calvin’s thwarted ambition, her solitary burden), though escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “cleverness as kindness” emerges through action: the inverted rhythm, shared cocoa, celebratory auroras. No moralizing—just the final smile that reweights the premise without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—celestial grit meets late-night radio hush—and stays locked to Mina’s perceptual bias. Compression (“static snow hissed…”) and purposeful elision (never over-explaining the signal mechanics) teach the pattern early and pay off in the auroral hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “tidal murmurs,” “snake swallowing tail.” No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances. Minor register lift in “socio-astrophysics” is justified by Calvin’s academic predation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: campus protest politics + mythic comet-architects + subsonic DJ counter-magic. The premise could collapse into gimmickry, but grounded detail (cocoa thermoses, blinking LEDs) makes the cosmic feel inevitable. Risky inversion of invasion trope pays off.</comment>
