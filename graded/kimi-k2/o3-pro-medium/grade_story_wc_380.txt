<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kerrin’s interiority is vivid—her folding tinder into the apron pocket, the brittle flowers, the merging infant—yet the “gleaming silence” refrain edges toward performed mood. The final choice to exhume her own core is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of fogged obedience), satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the harbor’s “wants” anthropomorphize without complicating her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the salt coffin dissolves, memories cascade back, and gravity steadies—cost is the infant’s dissolution into her chest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of spirals, salt, and silence tightens until the final image reweights all prior loss. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The whale’s ribs, salt crystals, and tidal crater are rendered with tactile specificity; the salt coffin constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—steam sliding sideways, crystals chiming—charging the closure. One hairline slip: “gleaming silence” repeats without new sensory angle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—tightens when the coffee-ground vision demands exhumation before dawn. Agency drives escalation: Kerrin pries the lid, pays with weight surge and restored grief. Cost is legible on the page; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as gravitational anchor emerges through salt-crystal imagery and the infant’s caged self; no explicit moralizing. Final image of lanterns mirroring salt crystals offers non-literal resonance: silence can gleam with promise. Complexity lingers—other townsfolk still buried—without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: perceptual signature of a lantern-lighter who notices wicks, tides, and gravity’s tilt. Syntax modulates—“Steam curled upward yet slid sideways”—under pressure. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“gleaming silence”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “salt fractured like hoarfrost” compresses sound, texture, and consequence. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent within the whale’s body and salt logic. Final line’s cadence crystallizes the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—memories harvested by salt crystals beneath beached whales—is fresh, grounded in maritime myth and physics metaphor. Risky lyric structure pays off: the infant self merging into Kerrin’s chest feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
