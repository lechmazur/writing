<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation (“why time slows in crisis”) is declared early and recurs, yet interiority remains largely summarized rather than dramatized; Sulin’s “serene anger” is announced, not embodied in choice or gesture. The only micro-choice—spilling the ink and accepting the risk—is compelling but happens late, so character depth pivots on a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens sustained: each observed trace escalates the surreal harvest of slowed seconds, culminating in the CR (Conceptual Repricing) of realizing the chamber “stores stretched seconds” for unknown power. Causes are implied rather than explicit, yet every textured shard tightens the final re-weighting. Orientation is granted via pattern-teaching early, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Wind-sculpted tents, plateau dust, and vanishing ink form a lived micro-setting that directly constrains options: the very ground becomes an unstable time door. Sensory selection sharpens crisis-time perceptions (ozone/cold iron), charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieving stolen time—remains coherent and accelerates under the accumulative lens; every new absence or thermal echo intensifies cost. The decisive downward dive forecloses retreat with felt risk.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Moral horror at commodifying crisis-time emerges through image (harvested campers drifting like “seeds”), not lecture. Theme deepens but risks abstraction in the final declaration of “justice returned.”</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Poetic compression and lyric patterning create a distinct, high-altitude register that tightens under pressure. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous grammar of fluid motion”) drifts into stylization but generally stays in character-bound attention.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Rich figurative stacks occasionally clump— “time inhaled fear” sits near “soft metal”—slowing propulsion momentarily. Density remains high overall, and no artifact muddies the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The fusion of nomad math, crisis-time mining, and disappearing-ink portal feels newly synthesized; tropes of secret desert research base and drone sidekick are reframed by time-theft metaphysics. The angle retains specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
