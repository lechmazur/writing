<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clay’s interiority is vivid—his “fingers that never tremble” and the visceral aversion to dishonesty anchor motive. The final acceptance of permanent truth-telling is earned by the prior causality of wilting near lies. One slip: the guardians’ chord-speech is more atmospheric than crucible, so relationship pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Clay’s exhale anchors dawn and the covenant’s price is legible—“he could never lie again.” Causal chain holds: crow → chip → chamber → tether → cost. Orientation is swift; lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The resonance chamber’s bronze petals and rusted guardians constrain every move; the orrery of cracked music boxes becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—“humming quietly with withheld sunrise.” One minor drift: streets “neither dark nor bright” feel generic before the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen dawn—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when Clay must trade lifelong honesty. Agency drives escalation: each whispered joy corrodes guardians, narrowing to the irreversible tether. Cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth as maintenance emerges from concrete acts—mending boxes, breathing honesty—never asserted. Final image of “luminous boxes” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the rust covenant’s demand lingers in ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—“tinkersong wonder, older than cathedral bells”—and sustains lyric compression without opacity. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during the tethering, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Clay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“rust cannot vanish, only remember.” No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Minor scaffold in “somewhere midnight had reached out like a thief” but it serves the fabular register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of music-box repair, philosopher’s stone shard, and rust covenant feels inevitable in hindsight. The covenant’s inversion—beauty yoked to decay—is a fresh angle on truth/lie stakes. Risky lyric mode heightens wonder without obscuring clarity.</comment>
