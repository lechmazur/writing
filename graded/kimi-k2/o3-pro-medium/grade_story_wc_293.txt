<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avery’s choices—pocketing the flake, stepping past the guardrail, playing the bridge—track with the “dynamically observant” trait and escalate. Interiority is embodied (light fracture noticing) rather than labeled, and the final renunciation (turning the lens toward others) is earned with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens is Hybrid shifting to Accumulative: beats accumulate sensory detail and possibility until the lens at the horizon reconfigures the entire frame. Closure lands via the fused glass that visibly re-prices earlier “never” into tomorrow’s planks; cost is the irrevocable giving-away of personal vision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mountain pullout anchors time/place quickly; scaffold wrap becomes micro-tool that enables the pixelated corridor. Spatial logic stays tight; frost and wind pressure choices (catwalk emerges from music vibrating beams).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Primary stake: transform impossibility into bridge of choices. Escalation accelerates as each melody turns a buried choice into present material; stakes tighten from personal fear of wasting talent to literal bridge-building for anonymous strangers at visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of hope-as-engineering emerges through specific action (recounting music builds tomorrow). Subtext lives in Avery realizing vision must serve others, not personal legend; final image reweights the opening “I play only for my echo” without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Luminous disbelief tint colours every observation; voice modulates from wonder to resolve under pressure. No head-hopping; focalizer knowledge stay strictly bounded, e.g., “he heard a secret” never slips into omniscient explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mirrors scene pressure—lucid, quick pulses when building the bridge; no scaffold sentences or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective (frozen tear of photography) and never muddles the final lens beat. High information density—every line advances possibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines photographic shard and musical bridge into a non-obvious synthesis; hitchhiker’s vanishing resolved not as trick but as catalytic role. Risky catwalk in void feels inevitable in hindsight because scaffold/flutters were seeded early.</comment>
