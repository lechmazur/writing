<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his ribs as a “cage,” the throat “stitched with unseen thread.” The mute season and the need to “listen until the sculpture told him” create a credible, character-bound constraint that drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—etching silent instructions—earns its cost because the prior beats have dramatized both his dependence on silence and the fragility of wonder. Only the council scene feels slightly external; their worry is sketched rather than pressed into Arlen’s skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the kinetic map will “speak in turning light” after Arlen is gone, a crystallized stance with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bell pulse, prism, and hairline crack layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric but legible. The only hairline slip is the council’s off-stage worry, which never truly narrows Arlen’s options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The Whispering bluff, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculpture are not backdrop but instruments: the bluff’s vibration, the fragment’s fracture, and the sculpture’s torque all constrain Arlen’s tactics. Sensory selection is urgent—clouds “curl like parchment,” torches “sputter like doubtful bees.” The final turquoise fire refracted onto ravens recharges the entire setting as a living score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tested by the hairline crack that threatens to “bleed into void.” One meaningful tightening: the faltering pulse that leads Arlen to the cracked hinge. Cost is visible in the silent etching of future instructions, a forfeiture of personal voice for communal continuance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the marriage of silence and resonance; no character states it. The final image—carved vector paths that “speak in turning light”—offers a non-literal answer to how wonder survives when words fail. Ambiguity lingers: will future hands truly feel the choreography? The cost of that uncertainty is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and perceptually skewed: vowels “stolen by wind,” bronze “awaiting pitch,” silence as “a dome amplifying everything unspoken.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses during repair, longer breaths at closure. No head-hopping; the lyric elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional flights—“ravens below thought the sea had climbed”—risk overwriting but are earned by pattern. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final cadence slows into the resonant dome without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bell-tuning, polar ice, and kinetic sculpture feels inevitable yet fresh. The mute bell-tuner who must listen to metal and carve silence into stone is a synthesis that would collapse if any element were swapped. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
