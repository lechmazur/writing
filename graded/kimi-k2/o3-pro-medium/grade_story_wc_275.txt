<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber’s pacifism is embodied in the sheathing of the knife and her choice to offer rose cuttings; the scars on her palms and her refusal of weapons show cost. Cullin’s shift from bounty hunter to watering-can bearer is credible but sketched more than dramatized. Interiority is specific and sensory, though the father-daughter reunion relies on familiar shorthand rather than fresh contradiction. The final shared planting crystallizes a relationship change with visible, gentle cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the council departs without taking the dome, and the father stays to learn roses—an Earned Stasis with felt social cost. Causality is coherent under a Causal lens: because Amber offers rooted calm instead of resistance, the soldiers’ stance softens. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the council leader’s turn feels slightly compressed, but the ending image of new seeds outside the dome reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The glass dome, thorn scars, and warm canvas scraps are tactile and selective. The roses-as-shields image constrains tactics during negotiation. Spatial choreography stays clean: debris scars the glass, vents are closed, petals form rings. Weather and light (peach dusk, dawn blaze) mirror emotional modulation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—save the dome—faces a concrete test when the convoy arrives. Escalation tightens once: Amber’s refusal to arm herself narrows options and forces a non-violent gambit. Cost is visible: risk of losing both home and father’s protection. The soldiers’ softening is earned through sensory immersion rather than coincidence.</comment>

<comment>Theme of continuity-through-fragility emerges through the engraved quiet and the final planting outside the dome. Subtext operates in gestures: Cullin’s watering can, the leader cradling hope. No moralizing; the ending image reweights the tower’s fall from trauma to fertile scar. Complexity is embraced: pacifism succeeds but remains fragile.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Amber’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—pressure changes, petal skin, scent as language. Cullin’s dialogue is spare and hoarse, distinct from Amber’s measured cadences. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer sentences for hush, clipped fragments when debris falls.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and sensory; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“roses swirl in sunset light like small shields”) serve double duty. Occasional elevated diction (“inculcating,” “hemorrhaging”) fits the lyric register without drifting into purple. Final paragraph seeds carry forward the motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of pacifist botany with post-collapse frontier politics feels fresh. “Engraved quiet” as a practice is specific and non-generic. The bounty hunter turned gardener trope is familiar but redeemed through tactile detail and earned emotional cost. No close echoes of famous scenes; the rose-ring negotiation is novel.</comment>
