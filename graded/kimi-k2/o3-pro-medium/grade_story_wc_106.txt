<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—“shadows sharpen and people grew careless with their faces”—but the moment of renunciation (emptying the jar) feels slightly under-motivated; the boy-as-younger-self arrives late and is more symbol than pressure. Still, her embodied dread and luminous disbelief anchor the final step through the door with credible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the jar’s moonbeams return stolen moments, the door opens, and Mara steps through, lighter yet hollow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each announcement reinterpreted layers pressure until the single cadence shift at the door. Cost is legible: “Mara’s own chest hollowed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cracked marble platform, emerald station lamps, and moonlit ladders are tactile and selective; the setting itself becomes the buyer, constraining the final choice to open the jar on-site. Spatial choreography is clean—rails hum beneath boots, ladders clink against rafters—charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bargain illuminated moments for time—tightens when Mara realizes the station is the buyer; the single deepening forces her to give the moments back. Cost is felt but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of theft versus gift emerges organically: “gifts given freely no longer require accounting.” The final door offers a non-literal answer—sunset eternal inside—without moralizing. Subtext in flower codes and station announcements deepens the meditation on destiny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined—“contraband constellations,” “liquid ladders”—with rhythmic control that accelerates at the uncorking. POV remains tight to Mara; the boy’s whisper is filtered through her shock. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor risk of purple in “frosting the air with silver promise,” yet the cadence supports the hush before release. No loops or scaffold; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “thief at the station” trope into a lyrical negotiation with time and memory. The moonbeam jar, flower codes, and emergent door feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant door image.</comment>
