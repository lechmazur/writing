<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s reverse-aging paradox is embodied in posture and gaze; Rowan’s hunger is shown through pacing and chalk-line refusal. Their power dynamic shifts via micro-choice (stepping the circle) with visible cost—Rowan’s erasure and Mira’s withheld recall. Interior contradiction (Mira’s memory of once being the old teacher) is cleanly anchored in present silence. Only the chalk glow and faint warmth keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: “throw a stone” triggers ripple-sentence → chalk circle → vanishing. Closure is Charged Poise: Rowan absent yet nearer than breath, Mira left with silhouette of possibility. Cost is legible in the unbroken air and her refusal to call him back. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating platform, iron-singing grotto, and mirrored pond constrain every beat: magnetic tug on the pebble, chalk circle hovering with impossible geometry, still water that re-runs its own ripples. Sensory hierarchy is Mira’s—she reads rings as sentences. Final image recharges the pond-as-mirror, tying setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: learn to vanish so that appearing feels miraculous. Pressure tightens once—from stone cast to chalk circle to vanishing—under causal lens. Agency is Rowan’s surrender inside the circle; cost is his literal absence. No escalation beyond the single deepening, but it suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of ripeness-through-delay emerges from withheld revelation and reversed time. Subtext lives in silence, chalk glow, and rewound ripples. Final image reweights the premise: vanishing is perfect arrival. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the silhouette of possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression taught early—“Night breathed through the sycamores”—and held. POV stays tight on Mira, then Rowan, with no head-hop. Perceptual signature: “wisdom pooled behind her young eyes,” “rings unfurled like breathing diagrams.” Rhythm modulates with hush and thrumming; final cadence crystallizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “iron dust that sang faintly,” “chalk line hovered with impossible geometry.” Metaphors are precise and physical. No filter-verb stacks. Final line—“Somewhere inside the hush, Rowan smiled, unseen but nearer than breath”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reverse-aging mentor, magnetic memory grotto, and vanishing-as-arrival synthesize into a fresh metaphysical lesson. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals: chalk circle, rewound ripples. Transformation test fails if names change—core is irreducibly this place and pair.</comment>
