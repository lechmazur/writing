<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ryn’s oath, interior contradiction (guild duty vs hunger quest), and embodied micro-choices (clipping spear to harness, rolling the glider) all track cleanly; the final renunciation—accepting stewardship of circulating memory—carries visible cost as the arches dim and silence returns. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “heart echoing.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: spear reforged, Ryn tasked to circulate memory, arches dimming = felt cost. Causal lens holds: arrow tip found → leads to chamber → mends → compels return. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 4. One meaningful tightening at spear’s command.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches, monolith vacuum, reverse-falling water all constrain tactics (magnetized boots, glider roll) and charge the final image (arches dimming). Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“whirling silence,” “liquid glass”). No exposition dumps; world rules learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save orchards from blight—signaled early. Escalation: gravity inversion clock narrows options; spear’s command forces trade-off (carry memory vs linger). Cost legible: arches extinguish, Ryn must act before reversion crushes sanctum. Agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-as-circulated-memory emerges from concrete events (arrow shards, voices feeding saplings) without moralizing. Final image of newborn buds laughing fragrance reweights prior blight imagery. Subtext in “whirling silence” modulates from suspense to earned hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “petrified waves,” “children breathing through hollow reeds.” POV stable, no head-hop. Compression taught early (“whirling silence”) and paid off at closure. Syntax mirrors pressure—long breathless sentences during glide, clipped fragments at spear moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; every sentence advances. Metaphors precise and consistent (vacuum-thick air, magnetic flowers). Rhythm accelerates during inversion, then settles into luminous cadence. No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity inversion orchard, memory-infused arrow choir, resilience as sonic fertilizer. Premise fully committed; no retreat to generic SF tropes. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Transformation test fails if any element swapped.</comment>
