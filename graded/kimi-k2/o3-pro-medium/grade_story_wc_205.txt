<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Velen’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs revolutionary longing—are embodied in every beat; the shard’s decoded confession forces an earned renunciation of easy victory and reopens his dormant commitment. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with cost. Only a slight over-articulation of “burnished sorrow” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chronostorm → experiment → shard unlock → council concession → personal reorientation, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Velen’s stance crystallizes with the visible cost of perpetual unfinished work. No causality breaks; mirrors and time rules are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid’s swirling bronze smoke and velvet-draped grotto are not backdrop but active constraints: the visible time and mirror protocol enable the shard’s revelation. Specificity is selective, sensorily balanced, and causally integrated. One minor spatial drift (“arcades” vs “corridors”) keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the shard is ornament or manifesto—escalates through Velen’s agency; the chronostorm experiment is a decisive, costly tactic that narrows options and forces public vindication. The personal cost (reopened wound of defeat) is felt on the page. Slight abstraction in “postponed revolutions” softens the final punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of inheriting unfinished revolutions. The shard’s confession reweights every prior image—rust, smoke, mirrors—into a non-literal mandate for future-making. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the final image of nightly covered mirrors as listening posts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to temporal textures and political fatigue. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“lustered ache”) is voice-motivated and consistent. One template cadence in the closing paragraph prevents 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. A single mixed metaphor (“varnish of burnished sorrow”) is minor. Final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of baroque asteroid, visible time, and revolutionary archaeology feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in temporal poetics heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; the shard-as-manifesto twist is grounded in prior world logic.</comment>
