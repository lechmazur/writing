<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority (mending the incomplete) is embodied through tactile choices—bare feet in silt, hands on torn kite, feather as splint—but the boy’s motivation flips from frustration to cheer without visible cost or micro-choice that dramatizes change; still, the adult-child dynamic under pressure crystallizes through joint labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight accretive sequence: storm wreck → feather hum → boy/tear → kite repair → communal music of nets resolving → feather aloft. Closure lands as earned stasis: the village hush and shared flight reconfigure meaning against a felt communal cost, all under lens of accumulating harmony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, dripping tamarisk, torn paper, glued shell fragments—all texture that literally shapes tool and choice; the feather-as-brace anchors final kite, ensuring environment charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in the incomplete) tightens when each broken fragment obliges craft and attention; protagonist agency drives middle beats, narrowing option down to communal flight. Price is quietly paid in the boy’s shame and the poet’s evening labor, not overstated but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme evolves from literal repair into quiet revelation that fragmentation is prerequisite for new form; final line “beauty in the incomplete revealed itself as the most perfect” is allowed because image, not narrator, enacts the concept with undeniable reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is liquid coastal lyric: “burnished hush”, “storm drained itself at dawn.” Perceptual signature is Edda-biased and stable; patterned elision (“it hummed faintly...”) taught early and paid at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dense but disciplined figurative layering: each line performs multiple senses/jobs. Occasional abstract filler (“gulls crooned low phrases that hovered like half-remembered lullabies”) drifts toward over-writing, clipped only at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><question>Transformation of kite-as-cliché into communal rite feels inevitable in hindsight; risk is quiet—the repair ritual turns personal wound into village chorus without gimmickry.</question>
