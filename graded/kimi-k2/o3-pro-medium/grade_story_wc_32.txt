<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Everard’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in the ritual’s micro-choices—balancing the tear, peeling away shame—so the final thaw feels earned. The interior contradiction (absorbing pain while outwardly unmoved) is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is visible: the mask of hopelessness is surrendered, foreclosing retreat. Minor slip: “stoically sensitive” is stated once rather than shown through earlier beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired crozier chimes Everard’s new, undefined name, severing the destiny-mask with felt cost. Causal linkage holds—each ritual step tightens the spiral toward this moment. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vivid—coals humming like tired angels, scent of frozen bloom—and constrains the ritual’s heat/cool paradox. Spatial choreography is clean; mercury path and obsidian spiral track. Micro-setting (the crozier itself) charges the final image. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interrupt destiny—signaled early and tightened through each ritual beat. Agency drives escalation: obsidian spiral, mercury pour, tear balance, shame confession. Final cost is the mask surrendered; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges from ritual action, not statement. The crozier’s repair reweights the concept: breaking cages births new authority. Final image offers non-literal answer—undefined name—without moralizing. Complexity lingers; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, paradoxical imagery (“frozen bloom”), rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Everard’s alchemical lexicon. Final chime crystallizes voice and meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances ritual or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“molten starlight,” “silver steam”—and serve pressure. Minor elevated diction (“vivify,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the arcane register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemist reforging a bishop’s crozier via entropy ritual to escape destiny. Tropes transformed through tactile specificity. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—detail is irreplaceable.</comment>
