<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emil’s interior contradiction—yearning for chromatic truth while hiding his own vow—drives every micro-choice; the final spoken vow costs him anonymity and is earned by the gray-footstep epiphany. Embodied emotion (“heart hammering with colorless static”) grounds the arc without therapy-speak. The childhood lullaby remains off-stage, so the mother is not a second on-page character; no relationship crucible applies. Flaw and desire interlock cleanly, satisfying the 9+ quick test except for the slight safety of the crowd’s wordless approval.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the night sky itself is re-tinted by Emil’s vow, a visible cost paid on the page (“unplanned colors poured upward”). Causal lens holds: each beat (lantern cover → hatch opens → ledger sings) follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. The final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The corroded Narwhal, kelp-webbed library, and lantern-lit tide constrain every move; the hotel key tag itself becomes micro-setting that unlocks the door. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“brine vapor whispering like pages flipped too quickly”). The setting charges the final image as color bleeds from hull to sky, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Emil dare to voice his hidden vow—tightens once when gray footsteps reveal the cost of secrecy. Agency drives escalation: he rows, descends, reads, then speaks. The price is the surrender of lifelong concealment, visible in the aurora that escapes the hull. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resonance acquires hue only when the promise behind sound is made honest. The luminous vows reweight the premise without moralizing; the final aurora is a non-literal answer to “the color of sound.” No thematic echo in final paragraph; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, image-dense, salt-stained diction—remains stable under pressure. POV modesty holds; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with emotional rise, culminating in the crystallized final line. Elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. High information density with read-aloud rhythm. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic quest meets sunken-ship library, rendered through a lamplighter’s nocturnal ritual. Tropes are transformed by specificity (koi-shaped shadows, saltwater ink). The final auroral discharge feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
