<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s hunger to record aging is embodied in the faltering tape-recorder beats; the prophet’s precognitive amnesia drives every driftwood rearrangement. Interior contradictions—clinging to echoes while accepting forgetting—are dramatized, not labeled. The final stance of “open-eared surrender” costs the narrator the recorded melody, a credible renunciation. Minor: the prophet’s status shifts aren’t fully legible in dialogue, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator accepts that memory must be carried in marrow, not tape, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each driftwood marker and chalk spiral thickens the pattern until the melody dissolves. Orientation is taught early via fog and brine, waived penalty. One causality hairline: the chalk reappears in the prophet’s hand without showing the transfer back, but the final image still reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, brine, and marble whale constrain movement and perception; the recorder’s physical faltering acts as micro-setting that shapes tactics. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of blood, salt taste—mirrors internal aging dread. Spatial choreography across rotating statues remains coherent. Environment directly charges the final image: “tomorrow’s rust beneath today’s fingertips.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—tightens when the melody of aging is heard then lost. Escalation is textural: each statue’s vibration adds density until the tape records only wind, foreclosing the narrator’s original goal. Prophet’s amnesia applies external pressure that complicates pursuit. Cost is legible: the erased recording permanently forfeits the sought sound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s value lies in its unreliability, not preservation. Subtext operates through gesture—chalk spiral glowing with “older sound”—rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: acceptance of forgetting becomes the only cartography. No redundant thematic statements; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: tidal longing filters every observation. Syntax lengthens and contracts with fog density, creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; prophet’s dialogue is sparse, distinctively oracular. Compressed diction under stress—“match had drowned again”—remains within narrator’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “statues dissolved in brine and mist like half-remembered vows” advances atmosphere and theme. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior image. One mixed vehicle: “smoke spirals” beside “drowned match” risks contradiction, but fog logic contains it. Final line achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog sculpture garden + precognitive amnesia + malfunctioning tape recorder synthesizes into fresh conceit; transformation test fails if any element swapped. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Specific detail—“rusty license plates dangled like devotional medals”—anchors originality. No derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
