<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miserly Naram-ben driven by fear and wonder in equal measure sparks the central quest; his frugality collides with cosmic generosity. Compression of internal calculus is concrete and scene-tied; the moment he places the astrolabe atop the tile crystallizes cost. The only ding: his final laughter feels slightly explanatory rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from “sell instruments—vow to decode tile—discover sigil—accept covenant.” Each because/therefore link locks tighter as the palace sheds invisible skin; resonance qualifies (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Minor looseness on exact timing of tile’s extra row feels like coincidence, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sensory anchoring is selective: cracked fountain, wall lions illuminated by unborn banners. Micro-setting pressure arises when dry basin fills with mirror-water—one choice point tied. At times prose overloads purple (“violet ash” > purposeful detail), holding it just short of top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding vs surrender—is signaled early and deepens with each schematic overlay. Mid-scene tightening forces the astrolabe sacrifice that forecloses retreat. Escalation is cogent under causal lens; one minor weakness: palace restoration heartbeat feels glorious but not choice-constraining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of devotion-as-discovery emerges as inverse doctrine: the covenant is curiosity itself, encrypted in number. Final image of aligned yet expanding constants is resonant reconfiguration without sermon. Quiet dignity rare at this length; only canned epiphanies in last sentences prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual filter is star-calibrated, coin-rubbed concrete; diction skews archaeo-mathematic but always rooted in Naram-ben’s lexicon. Line-level propulsion controls breath from star-counts to tile throb. Frequent alliteration never feels ornamental—serves rhythmic pulse under suspense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Precise, economical detail leaps off the page—no loops, no scaffold. Every sentence does double duty of character and cosmos. Rhythm scales from tight nervous breaths to wide planetary pulse. A single over-pretty “drooped like tired equations” is forgiveable flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Seeds commitment-as-devotion, pays with star-geometry covenant—fresh twist on astronomical worship. Combination of schematic overlay and mythic resonance feels inevitable on reread. Stakes do feel unique to this tile, not generic magic object; only clichéd lions blink eyes at climax costs tiny grade.</comment>
