<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; Ariste’s trembling hands and the narrator’s breath-cadence anchor contradictory impulses. The borrowed heartbeat is dramatized through micro-choices (steady breathing, final palm-to-stone) rather than labels. Cost is felt when the child’s laughter rises—proof the circuit completed—yet Ariste’s own heart now beats alone, a quiet renunciation of further miracles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of breath, pigment-syllables, and mirrored avenues intensifies until the terrace itself reconfigures possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the hush deeper than any bell—where the city’s clocks forget their duty and the mural hums open futures. Cost is legible in the child’s returned, richer heartbeat and Ariste’s relinquished conduit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble stairs, prism parapet, and andesite floor are tactile and selective; the terrace’s listening stone constrains the mural’s possibility. Rain-sweet fragrance and lavender light charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return the child’s fading heartbeat richer—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each brushstroke tightens the cadence until the city’s clocks yield. The final hush forecloses the bell-driven deadline, trading urgency for open possibility; cost is the painter’s loss of borrowed pulse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act: mirrors taught to show futures rather than mere reflections. No moralizing; the child’s laughter and the shimmering alley doorways embody the idea. Final image of “gentle bells of possibility” reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through breath and color. Syntax modulates with pressure—long coils of description yield to the hush’s single crystalline sentence. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in the narrator’s steady breathing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image, sound, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (mirrors as doors, bells of possibility) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates into the final chord then settles into the hush, mirroring heartbeat sync.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—painting lullabies into stone to teach mirrors possibility—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names or places change; the terrace’s listening rock and melody-pigments are irreplaceable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant closure.</comment>
