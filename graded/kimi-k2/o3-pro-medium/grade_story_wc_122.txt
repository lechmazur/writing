<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is embodied and specific—her cane “thunderous within her bones,” her pulse “fluttered, uncertain but willing.” The contradiction between her deafness and vocation is dramatized through tactile listening and the final renunciation of hoarding silence. The cost is felt when she seals the needle and leaves the cavern, carrying “her newly awakened heart as baton.” Minor slip: the note’s graphite cue is clever but slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maris’s choice to share rather than keep the hush reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each backward vibration layers density until the cavern itself becomes an orchestra of silence. Cost is legible in the final image: she walks out “carrying her newly awakened heart,” the filament’s covenant fulfilled. No causality breaks; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s cedar-pitch scent and mirrored hush are not backdrop but active constraint: the filament “quivered when she breathed,” the drum heads “swelling like lungs.” The setting supplies the gramophone and unfinished drums that enable the climax. Final image—the leaves’ whisper now “echoed within her drums”—charges the closure. One minor drift: “villagers outside paused” is slightly telescopic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened through each backward note that “bled warmth into stone walls.” The meaningful turn occurs when Maris chooses to share the silence rather than perfect technique; the cost is the surrender of private mastery. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: density of vibration, memory, and communal resonance. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of “audibly muted yet profoundly heard.” Silence as generative force is dramatized, not asserted; the final image of distant thunder “applauding in restraint” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—her bow to the filament, the tear “starved for salt.” Complexity is preserved: numbness retreats but the pulse must be carried onward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “dust formed hieroglyphs of former storms,” “crystal winter starlight.” Perceptual signature is filtered through tactile listening; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“she listened inwardly”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer breaths in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and coherent. Strong verbs—“threaded,” “swelling,” “retreated”—replace modifiers. Final line “the world could be audibly muted yet profoundly heard” crystallizes without overwriting. Minor filter verb in “she felt tears shape themselves” is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of deaf music teacher + backward phonograph + filament of hush feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes of magical instrument and chosen one are transformed through embodied silence and communal transmission. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals: goat skins, graphite indentations, cedar scent.</comment>
