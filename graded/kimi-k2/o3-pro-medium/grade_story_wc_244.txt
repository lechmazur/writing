<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pamphleteer’s loneliness is embodied and drives every micro-choice; Milo’s courteous anarchy is vivid yet his interior remains opaque. Motivations stay consistent, but the final reciprocity feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrested from flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens holds: rumor summons → lantern ritual → shared cadence. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (shared rhythm replaces isolation) with felt cost (each must now carry the tune). One minor slack: the nurse & accountant arrive with no causal trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ivy Station is tactile, lived-in, and constrains movement; the lantern, crate, and moon fragment function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the ivy bowing at the exit is earned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cure for loneliness—tightens through each beat: arrival, manifest writing, communal rhythm. Cost is visible (each stranger must now reciprocate), but escalation is gentle rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: loneliness is logistical, cured by scheduled impossibility. Final image of rumor “arranging the next gathering” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the moon rock’s unheard conversations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct, jocular, and self-lacerating; Milo’s diction (“courteous anarchy”) matches his mythic role. No head-hopping; compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; metaphors rarely repeat and rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional ornate flourish (“etiquette and mutiny could belong in the same breath”) stays within voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses disaster logistics with emotional first-aid in a fresh way; the moon rock as social catalyst is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking (polite anarchy, rumor as courier) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
