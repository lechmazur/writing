<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and artistic vocation are embodied in the tarot-mother portrait; his surrender to the drifting Moon card crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific, but the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices (following smoke threads, releasing the card) align with motive and flaw. No stock therapy-speak; the final darkness reads as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s letting-go reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density of water, memory, and light re-knits perception. Causality is lyric rather than linear, taught early by shifting sentences and colors. Cost is legible in the velvet-wing darkness and the lantern’s calming beam. No orientation debt; lighthouse, library, and sea-cave stay spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library-sea-cave triad is vivid, selective, and constrains tactics: shelves curve, mirror cracks leak tide, kelp ribbon pins the Moon. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—salt-burn, wet linen, blue fungus. Environment actively tilts and floods, forcing descent. Micro-setting (mirror shard, tarot card) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redesign life vs. maternal guilt—tightens when fragmented reality forces surrender rather than capture. Escalation is accretive: shifting colors, rising water, tilting walls. One decisive deepening: releasing the Moon card forecloses retrieval and redefines redemption as buoyant surrender. Cost is visible in the engulfing darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fractured perception as art emerges from concrete particulars—bleeding portraits, silver fish, cracked mirror—without moralizing. Final image reweights earlier guilt: cracks become contours, Moon glimmers ambiguously. Subtext operates in smoke threads and velvet wings. Resonance lingers in the unanswerable question, “sky or canvas?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, salt-stained, and consistent: “salt-burn,” “luminescent ache,” “velvet wings.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long spirals down, then clipped surrender. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Elias’s. Experimental elision (colors shift, sentences rearrange) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective, never muddled. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with scene—storm punches, walls breathe, water pools. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent ache”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—portrait artist using tarot to redesign life inside a sentient lighthouse—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: tarot-mother portrait, silver fish, and mirror-bleeding canvases are irreducibly specific. Risk-taking (lyric fragmentation, water rising indoors) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
