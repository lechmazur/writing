<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orlan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulses—despising his father’s legacy yet carrying the marbles—drive every beat. The final choice to keep the cracked marbles as “promises” is earned by the garden’s testimony and his own caretaking. Minor slip: “wisely pragmatic” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s new register “Gardener” reweights the premise of measurable luck. Causal chain—polish → sap seal → needle shift—holds cleanly. Cost is legible in the townspeople’s gauges dimming then glowing, redistributing his hoarded luck.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze is not backdrop but active agent: drought-starved roses, shifting hedges, roots gripping the sundial all constrain Orlan’s choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor spatial drift: “corridor opened” is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens recognize caretakers—tightens when polishing the marble triggers the maze’s rearrangement. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of victories recalled, then sudden systemic shift. Cost is the redistribution of luck, felt by the crowd.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mended deception emerges organically from cracked marbles → transparent sphere → communal rebalancing. Final image of “blooming withering” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thesis statements; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in horticultural idiom (“gauge the plant’s private arithmetic”). Patterned elision (“mended deception as if it were a craft”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“reducing planets to axioms”—barely grazes clarity. Rhythm modulates with scene tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of luck-as-taxable-currency is fresh; synthesis with sentient garden feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
