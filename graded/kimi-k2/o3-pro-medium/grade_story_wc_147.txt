<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional caution vs. gnawing curiosity—are embodied in micro-choices (overriding instinct, micro-thruster ballet). The scholar’s dying refusal to inhale again crystallizes the cost of obsession, earning Mara’s quiet renunciation of the sunset’s memory. Secondary pressure from the scholar is minimal but sufficient to tilt her final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vial secured, sunset fragment lodged behind Mara’s eyes, cost felt in the ache of cliffs that no longer exist. Causal chain holds—distress pulse → temple → vial → rescue—without teleporting props. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Underwater temple, bioluminescent spores, and the crystal vial constrain every move; lasers and pressure dictate tactics. The “lonesome splendor” palette mirrors internal ache and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save scholar vs. preserve vial—tightens once when Mara chooses to unsnarl lasers instead of abort. Escalation is causal: each override of instinct narrows options until the sunset’s inhalation buys minutes but steals memory. Cost is visible in the scholar’s cracked lungs and Mara’s sunset shard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserving the ephemeral emerges from concrete action: capturing sunset in breath, carrying vanished cliffs in memory. Final image reweights premise—beauty survives only as internal perfume—without moralizing. Subtext in scholar’s refusal to inhale again underscores cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical, sensorily precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“Pressure creaked… bioluminescent spores drifted”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a trained diver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure (“lanternfish like drifting stained glass”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Final cadence shift—“waves crashed beneath cliffs that no longer existed”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: star-diver archiving sunset-scent in a drowned temple. Transformation test fails—plot collapses if vial or temple is swapped. Risky lyric mode pays off; no derivative premise echo.</comment>
