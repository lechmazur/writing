<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serafina’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. vanity, sentiment vs. control—are dramatized in every micro-choice (cracking the capsule, diverting caravans). The steel-heart/hoarded-memory tension is embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation is earned and costly. Fyodor’s single tear refracts their shared compromise, adding relational pressure without crowding the frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Decisive Change: the drought she funded is reversed on-page via two terse phone orders, carrying reputational and financial cost. Causal chain—manufactured drought → salt map → egg → release → unmake drought—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by salt-flat body and rover within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; causal logic tightens to final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt flat is not backdrop but active antagonist: cracks form the map that guides her, heat incubates the egg, briny wind steals the parasol. Sensory triangulation (salt powdering air like bone, silk bruised purple) is selective and POV-filtered. Final rain erasing the map reconfigures the setting itself as closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo at personal cost—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: drought she created now thwarts her goal; each step (reading cracks, cracking capsule, issuing orders) narrows options and raises price. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent. Cost is reputational ruin and direct financial loss, legible in the phone call.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of manufactured absence seeking its own undoing emerges through salt, drought, and echo. Subtext in Fyodor’s wet eyes and the parasol’s flight carries more weight than any statement. Final image—rain erasing the map while the bird sings—offers non-literal, resonant answer to “what does it mean to preserve an echo?” No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “coins tossed to mask the sound of breaking vows,” “salt powdered the air like ground bone.” Syntax mirrors Serafina’s brittle control—long sentences fracture into single-word imperatives. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Compression (“she signed the permits, silenced reporters”) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, choice, or cost. Metaphors are coherent and physically grounded. Rhythm accelerates with the rocking egg, then breathes with the first raindrop. No register drift or purple overload. Final line “felt, at last, fully human” earns its abstract noun through prior salt-and-blood specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-restoration as personal atonement via extinct-bird resurrection on a self-engineered salt flat. Trope of “redemption through release” is transformed by making the drought the protagonist’s own monument. Cerulean caracara reborn from fossil egg feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric density pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
