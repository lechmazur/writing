<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eridian’s interiority is vivid—his refusal to abandon the “mathematics of emotion” drives every micro-choice; the ache over Lio is embodied in nightly measurements and the orchard’s pulse. The final renunciation (thanking silence instead of demanding return) is earned and costly. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equation of loss is reweighted from “closure” to “continuing function.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (drips, glow, mosaic) tightens until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the permanent placement of the glass eyes and the orchard’s new rhythm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop; drip intervals and silverleaf glow constrain Eridian’s experimental tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; every detail (stalactite metronomes, moss-muffled stone) is filtered through his urgent focus. One step short of 9+ only because the environment does not physically block an exit—constraint is temporal/aesthetic rather than spatial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—render ambiguous loss calculable—is signaled early and tightened once: the mosaic cipher forces a shift from seeking resolution to embracing rhythm. The cost is the acceptance of perpetual ache, visible in the orchard’s re-tuned irrigation. Agency drives the escalation; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as a non-terminating function. The final image (glass eyes broadcasting halos) offers a resonant, non-moral answer—loss influences every subsequent calculation. No thematic statement is declared; meaning accrues through pattern and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a conjurer’s lexicon (“lattice,” “Hope Fractions”) and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Eridian notices what serves his equation. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are fresh (“fruit pulsed like pocket hearths”) and never muddle causality. Minor scaffold (“then he…”) is absent; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of grief-math, orchard alchemy, and mosaic cipher feels inevitable and singular. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. No derivative echoes; the premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
