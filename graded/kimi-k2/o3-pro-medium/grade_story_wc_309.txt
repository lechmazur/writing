<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Felius’s interior contradiction—yearning for brilliance while embracing mediocrity—drives every beat; the keystone choice, mist descent, and final warming all spring from this tension. Embodied emotion (“brilliant dimness,” “breathing into cold palms”) is specific and non-generic. The earned stasis—carrying a pocket-sun back to “lower worlds”—forecloses the old life with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each image layers density until the final “soft, sacred dimness” reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate (icebound spire, sunrise). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spire’s warmth and Felius’s new dimness crystallize with felt cost—the quills’ soggy collapse is the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spire’s paradoxical directions and frost walls constrain every move; the keystone itself becomes micro-setting that enables the impossible stairs. Sensory selection (brittle air, silver ribbons) is filtered through Felius’s underachiever lens. The warming chamber’s ordinary blessings anchor the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the “brilliant dimness” survive automation? Escalation is textural: each beat deepens the gulf between mechanical brilliance and human imperfection until the final flare reweights the conflict. Cost is visible—quills drown in their own genius.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of automation and sacred ordinariness; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “brilliant dimness” offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier motifs. Subtext lives in the keystone’s courteous impossibility and the quills’ frozen tears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“consonants kissing,” “mist coiling like incubating thought”—remains consistent under pressure. POV is tightly focalized; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision (“directions behaved like untrained pets”) are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“incubating thought”) is voice-motivated and legible. Final third is artifact-free, preserving closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: automation-era mage seeks anti-genius. Tropes (underachiever, sacred object) are transformed through the spire’s paradoxical physics and the keystone’s courteous impossibility. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
