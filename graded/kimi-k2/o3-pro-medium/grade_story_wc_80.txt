<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Callum’s contradictory impulses—stoic restraint vs. emotional excavation—are embodied in every micro-choice (kissing the wood, bowing to emptiness). The antique inkwell and dowelled notes externalize an interior conflict that tightens across beats. Closure shows earned renunciation: he leaves lighter, having paid with the burden he surrendered to the pavilion. The only flaw is a touch of abstract self-diagnosis (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) that slightly dilutes embodied motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: rising drawbridge → low-tide access → discovery of lockbox → insertion of own notes → drawbridge descends. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pavilion’s hum and erased footprints crystallize a before/after without tidy resolution. Cost is visible in the relinquished burden and the literal erasure of his presence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Submerged marble, barnacled lockbox, and cedar dowels are tactile constraints that shape every action. The inkwell’s brass and velvet interior become micro-settings charged with generational irony. Environment literally narrows options as tide-clock pressure mounts. Final image—footprints erased by rising water—reconfigures meaning under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve forgotten dreams against tidal erasure. Escalation occurs via dwindling time and the lockbox’s refusal to yield until forced. Each dowel driven is a micro-cost that forecloses alternative uses of energy or memory. The tightening is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges through concrete acts: dowels sealing absence, masks melting into ink, footprints erased. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the final image of a chorus of future readers breathing again. Subtext operates in the silence after the pavilion’s hum. The concept reweights itself at closure without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “brine erupts through the tiles like trapped applause” marries sensory specificity to emotional register. Perceptual signature is consistent—Callum notices groans of wood, patterns of absence, salt sealing paper. No POV leakage; interiority stays embodied. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating as water rises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor elevation in diction (“approbation”) is earned by context. Final line’s cadence recharges earlier motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conceit of a surveyor who repairs foundations with memories is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test: swapping profession or object would collapse the emotional logic. Specificity of the drowned pavilion and inkwell inheritance prevents generic allegory. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final hush.</comment>
