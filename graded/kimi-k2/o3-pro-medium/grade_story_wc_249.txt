<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ira’s interiority is vivid—her quiet rebellion surfaces in embodied micro-choices (tapping the stump, lemon-juice annotations) that escalate to collective action. The contradiction between obedience and revolt is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation—refusing to remain observer—carries visible cost as the experiment slips the leash. Only the sister’s grief feels slightly generalized, preventing a 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared tapestry absorbs private grief and reconfigures the Institute’s goal without reversing it. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each syncopated tap layers density until the system yields. The cost is legible in the director’s pale realization and the machines’ stillness. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or logic breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden, crystalline stump, and auric lagoon are not backdrop but instruments: the stump transmits Ira’s taps, the lagoon freezes glyphs that later reweave into her sister’s laugh. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“smelled of electricity”). The greenhouse roof opening directly enables the final image exchange. Only the auroras’ sorrow edges toward overt symbolism, slightly softening the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ownership of collective memory—tightens when Ira’s drumming hijacks the protocol. One decisive turn: her refusal to stay passive forces the system to accept unscripted contributions. Cost is visible in the director’s loss of control and the irreversible dispersal of private memories. Pressure escalates via rhythmic density rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between individual grief and communal hope; no character states it. The sister’s laughter reappears transmuted into “dawn-colored promise,” reweighting sorrow without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the stilling of machines, the director’s pallor. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: shared dreams cannot be owned, only breathed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the sonic motif. Perceptual signature is Ira’s: frequencies “glowed like breathing flowers,” auroras “drooping like tired curtains.” No POV leakage; even collective drumming is filtered through her body. Compression and elision are taught early (“memories fluttered out like startled swans”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and grounded (“lagoon into concentric halos”). Rhythm accelerates with the drumming beats, then exhales in the final line. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “transmuted by collective will”—but it lands within Ira’s heightened perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—shared memory as literal breathable tapestry—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through Ira’s tactile rebellion. Risky lyric structure holds together under pressure; the sonic garden is not mere set dressing but the engine of transformation. No close echoes; the iron-kite boy and constellation-quilt mother are specific inventions. Transformation test: swapping any detail would collapse the resonance.</comment>
