<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ripple-Mark’s want for interior stillness is dramatized through embodied micro-choices; the ice-shard crack listening beats embody contradiction, and the final renunciation of bottled silence is earned with visible cost. Flawed desire remains active in scene and drives ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: rhythmic density of sound/quiet builds to bloom-of-hush closure that reconfigures meaning. Causality is compressed but coherent—each micro ritual (ice divination, echo ingestion, silence exhale) tightens stakes and lands final charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Frost patterns, stone pores, and glow-orb lighting are filtered through tactile POV; caves and sound fields pressure tactics and foreclose retreat paths. Specific tools (ice shard, luminescent orb) constrain choices and charge closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve pockets of hush after alien resonance—narrows with each beat; escalation comes from internal silence meeting imported silence, tightening options until renunciation emerges. Agency lies in orchestrating release, not escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultivated silence blooms through specific events; no didactic statement. Final gesture of abandoning the echo orb crystallizes non-literal answer: calm is practice, not place, weighted by relinquished artifact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression and patterned diction teach themselves early; perceptual signature remains consistent. Interior texture modulates with pressure, but head-hop and dialogue are minimal—voice sustains single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally and propels; few loops or scaffold. High information density; sensory phrasing avoids purple. One strained mixed metaphor on stalactite “kissing” costs minor clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: energy beings as second silence seed; ritual mapping transformed into release practice. Non-obvious integration of alien resonance and cartographer craft; risk heightens stakes without gimmicks.</comment>
