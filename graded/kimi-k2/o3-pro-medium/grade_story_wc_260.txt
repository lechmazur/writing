<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calder’s interior contradiction—yearning for admiration versus the need for honesty—is embodied in the tactile ritual of cutting away dyed lining; the final choice to return the tail tip carries visible cost and forecloses the path of further deceit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Calder renounces illusion, stitches a truthful sign, and steps toward exile with the tail tip returned—cost is the loss of easy applause and the gamble of honest demonstration. Causal lens holds from con-reveal to dawn walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty workshop, bone knife, brazier, and cedar-scented smoke are woven through action; the chameleon tail tip becomes a micro-setting that constrains Calder’s ritual and charges the final image when he vows to return it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of self-respect versus exile—is signaled early; pressure tightens as Calder burns boasts and stitches pauses, culminating in the choice to face villagers with truth; cost is the gamble of public shame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation and honest transformation emerges from Calder’s ritual acts; the final image of smoke drifting like benediction reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonance in the reader’s after-image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—velvet stars, patient snakes, quietly vivid—mirrors Calder’s gentle precision; no head-hopping; compression and patterned elision taught early and paid off in the final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with emotional beats, culminating in the crystalline final sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar redemption arc is transformed through the chameleon tail ritual and the quietly vivid sensory palette; the synthesis feels inevitable and specific rather than generic.</comment>
