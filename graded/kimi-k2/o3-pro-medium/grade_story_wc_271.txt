<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anisa’s contradictory impulses—freeze vs. act—are embodied in the thunder-triggered relapse and Malik’s fingertip rescue; the final planting ritual earns her renunciation of pure survival with visible cost. Interiority is specific (seed behind ear, dirt-lined pulse), though the “pearl of stillness” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl image reframes grief into focused light, cost paid by Anisa’s public relapse and the visitors’ silent vow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each station layers sensory density until the final hush reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass corridor, salt wind, and trembling greenhouse wall act as micro-settings that constrain breath and choice; the shattered lighthouse lens reappears in the closing image, charging the pearl metaphor. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry hope without denial—tightens when thunder triggers Anisa’s freeze; the somatic experiment forces a public test with visible stakes (her relapse, the visitors’ silence). Cost is legible; escalation is one deepening, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: stillness as rerouted sap, pearl as focused ruin. Final image of pearl inside cracked lens offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in Malik’s fingertip and the unbroken pearl carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—salt-crisp air, “loose gears” gulls—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tight to Anisa; no head-hop. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“I almost froze”). Rhythm modulates with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops, vivid yet selective figurative language. Occasional elevated diction (“somatic markers”) is justified by context. Final pearl image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma therapy and horticulture; drone-strike wedding survivor guiding somatic tours in a cliffside greenhouse feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky compression pays off in the pearl-lens refraction.</comment>
