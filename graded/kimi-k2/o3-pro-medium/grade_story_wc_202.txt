<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Irida’s motives (honour overlooked histories, translate light) are clear and shape every decision; the lens exchange, Aven collaboration, rooftop climb all flow from trait-driven wants. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the tug of overlooked histories”). Micro-choice on the bridge (“lifted the shard toward the moon”) crystallizes stakes with audible physical cost. Aven is secondary but his exhaustion and final whisper register price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers density—object acquired → pigment sea → ascent → sky release—until the final image discharges all earlier pressure with the shard’s dissolution. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “pure direction rather than material” reweights reality for child and city. Orientation anchors who/where by line two; no drift. Cost is tangible on the page (“brush, exhausted”) and in Irida’s kneel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Market “shivering rooftops” to “clouds parted as if some colossal librarian” stays vivid yet purposeful; rope bridges, rooftops, river, and sky each shape tactics (access, risk, canvas, receiver). Objects (lens fragment, wet panel) function as micro-setting constraints closing moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: translate forgotten sea-voices before dawn erases them. One decisive intensification: lens in paint refracts voices into city dreams—this tightens the option set to sky return. Cost accrues on page: Aven’s fatigue, Irida’s knees, shard’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme that history is not lost but translated emerges through concrete transfer (lens → pigment → sky). Light as language is never stated, only enacted. Final image of child dreaming “salt breeze” gives resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person close stays consistent; perceptual specificity (“shivering,” “copper chains,” “salt breeze”) is POV-bound. All elisions taught early (“lighthouse lens” implies translation logic). Rhythms modulate under pressure: short bursts near the top, slowed heartbeat before shard release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Rare figurative density (“chimneys threaded like veins”) justifies its pulse; no mixed metaphors. “The panel still painted itself” compresses impossibility with motion clarity. Occasional scaffolding phrase (“elusively tangible”) is minor against cumulative effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Translator who renders light-dialects is non-obvious; premise stays intact without meta flourish. Transmuted tropes: lighthouse as migratory rather than fixed, lens as currency, paint as rescue vessel. Small risk, cleanly landed.</comment>
