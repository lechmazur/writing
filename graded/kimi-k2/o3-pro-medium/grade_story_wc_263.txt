<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s interiority is vivid—embodied exhaustion, moth-wing pressure, the taste of stardust—yet the final surrender of the “lantern of his own imaginings” feels slightly under-motivated; the voices’ assurance that “emptiness was sometimes the precise space” arrives as authorial fiat rather than earned contradiction. Still, his micro-choices (tracing glyphs, pressing the astrolabe to his chest) reveal a hierarchy of values that forecloses his future as dream-bearer with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quill freed, creativity restored, Ilya emptied yet resonant. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor etches a line until the final comet completes the map—while the surrender of remembered stardust supplies undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; the archway and tundra are anchored within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway, bronze heart, and frost-laced lichen are not mere backdrop; they constrain pacing (counting paces beneath curtains of fire) and charge the final image as the aurora bows in emerald reverence. Sensory selection narrows under exhaustion—raw cheeks, moth-wing skull pressure—keeping detail purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightened by the unwritten calendar’s sidereal fatigue. The final surrender of personal stardust is a visible price that reweights the village’s sudden awakening. One meaningful deepening suffices; coincidence (the comet) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creativity demands self-emptying, and the cosmos reconfigures around that void. The quill, once silenced, now writes through others; Ilya’s hollowing is the non-literal answer. No moralizing—just the lingering image of a bell rung clear of clapper yet still resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “shadowed rapture,” “sidereal fatigue,” “emerald reverence.” Syntax modulates with fatigue—long breathless clauses collapse into fragments at rest. No POV drift; the cosmos speaks through implication, never exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—moth wings, bronze heart, lung-shaped chamber—and never muddle causality. No loops or scaffold; even the repeated “unspoken words” accrues new weight each time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of astrolabe-as-heart, calendar-of-feelings, and creativity-as-swan-under-ice feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final image of stars lingering like grateful witnesses reconfigures the entire quest without a conventional triumph.</comment>
