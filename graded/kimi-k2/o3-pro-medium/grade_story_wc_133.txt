<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlin’s insomnia, wry earnestness, and need to “thresh meaning” are embodied through restless micro-choices—mixing pigments, trudging the causeway, painting the spiral. The final covenant with remembering shows earned change with cost. Adra’s archival identity is thinner but still presses choice. Interiority stays concrete; no stock therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral sentence and shared covenant reweight both characters’ futures with felt cost. Causal chain—causeway crossing, brooch exchange, spiral inscription—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The constraint of vanishing tide tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Salt-gleamed cottages, plankton-pooled altar, and silver rain-trails are vivid, selective, and filter through Marlin’s painterly bias. The tidal island’s physical rules (causeway, returning tide) constrain escape and charge the final image. Weather and micro-setting (resin smear on sternum) shape tactics. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning”—is tested by the island’s demand for memory-exchange. Pressure escalates through the brooch’s glow, chapel tremor, and final covenant; each step narrows options. Cost is visible: insomnia becomes covenant, archives become gardens. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the spiral inscription.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory, water, and art emerges organically from the exchange ritual and final spiral. Subtext in plankton pools and barnacled statues avoids overt statement. The closing sentence reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. Complexity lingers: no tidy redemption, only awakened listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, salt-stung, rhythmically controlled—“dry wave against broken shells.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marlin’s perception. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in Adra’s recitation of lost titles.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silver rivulets winked under cloudbreaks” does triple duty. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is patterned and earned. Final spiral inscription crystallizes without overwriting. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floodland relic quest is familiar, but the amber brooch with rotating droplets, plankton altar, and insomnia-as-covenant feel freshly synthesized. Specificity of salt-gleam and resin smear anchors universals. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echoes. Transformation test passes.</comment>
