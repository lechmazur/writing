<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dreya’s interiority is vivid—her borrowed personalities bruise ribs and pulse like chalk—but the final renunciation (“loved its motion”) feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is legible yet not fully embodied in a last micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the printed ambiguity rekindles the cosmos, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift tighten stakes until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The press, halo fragment, and vanishing stars constrain every tactic; the workshop’s topaz glow and rekindled starlight charge the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate, sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency, and environment guides choice without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—print the astronomer’s grief before stars vanish—tightens once when Dreya chooses deliberate ambiguity to summon light. Cost is visible: borrowed loneliness bruises her ribs and the cosmos blanks out before return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation of emotion; ambiguity as method and the refusal to fully solve empathy resonate without moralizing. Final image (“silence that felt exactly like being understood”) offers non-literal, earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—syntax bends like press gears, perceptual signature filters every star and prime. Patterned lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping, register stays within Dreya’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, no mixed metaphors or loops. Occasional elevated diction (“lucid turbulence”) fits the lyric mode and does not obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—printing grief as equations via transposed empathy—is fresh and fully committed; risk-taking (mirrors, moth wings, midnight bread as type) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
