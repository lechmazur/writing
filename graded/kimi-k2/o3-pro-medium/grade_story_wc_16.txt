<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ada’s “carefully reckless” nature is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—dipping the quill, tying ribbons, humming chords—that visibly risk the archive’s wrath and her mother’s legacy. Interior contradiction (yearning vs. fear) stays active in-scene. Final bow and unfinished tune show earned cost: she forecloses personal vengeance for communal harmony. Minor slip: the mother backstory is summarized, not felt in a present beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive sings, treaties are inked, and silence is transmuted from rupture to rest. Causal linkage holds—each translated phrase unlocks shelves, each ribbon binds delegates, the final stanza conducts the choir. Cost is legible in the extinguished ribbons and Ada’s relinquished private grief. One micro-turn: archive almost swallows her, then accepts her motive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive is not backdrop but instrument: dust motes become notes, shelves exhale chords, ribbons glow like vines. Spatial choreography is exact—lantern dimming, shadows dancing, exit receding. The glass ink well refracts light to constrain her tactics (prismatic ink, ribbon extinguisher). Final image of doors reopening anchors earned stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust before paths diverge—tightens via tempo: each translated line shortens the clock, each ribbon raises audible stakes. Agency drives escalation: Ada’s humming literally reconfigures the chamber. Cost is felt when the ribbons burn out in the ink well, sealing her private loss into public gain. No slack loops; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: language as living music that can re-stitch a sundered polity. Subtext hums in the archive’s conditional trust—ghosts who must be persuaded, not commanded. Final silence “like rest, not rupture” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity preserved: diplomacy remains fragile, personal grief unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from cautious hush to orchestral crescendo. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—braided clauses, triple-meter directive. Perceptual signature is Ada’s synesthetic attention: glyphs like “braided rivers,” dust “spiraling like muted applause.” No POV drift; every image filtered through her arcane-linguist bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: “dust spiraled like muted applause” does triple duty (setting, mood, foreshadowing). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors at climax. Rhythm accelerates with stakes; final paragraph breathes into quiet resolution. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise of singing archives feels inevitable given Ada’s vocation and the mother’s glass well. Tropes (lost language, magical library) are re-embodied through sensory specificity and political stakes. Risk: trusting music to bind diplomats without on-page coercion pays off via audible betrayal feedback. Fresh synthesis: diplomacy as choral performance.</comment>
