<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla’s contradictory impulses—librarian’s caution vs. ancestral obsession—are embodied in micro-choices (midnight disinterment, copper nail tap, final exchange). The cost of her renunciation is legible in Havel’s trembling hand and the vanished footprints. Minor slip: “nervously confident” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marla’s step across the channel forecloses return, paid by the copper nail receipt. Causal chain (nail → buoy tone → wind pivot → corridor) holds under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The weather station, buoy, and silt corridor constrain every tactical move; the copper nail functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange. Sensory hierarchy (wet wool clouds, epileptic red sensors) filters through Marla’s urgency. One minor drift: “moth-eaten” smile is vivid but not leveraged later.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—ancestral honor vs. present life—tightens when the corridor demands exchange. The gale’s breach of the helipad is the single meaningful escalation that forces the irreversible choice. Cost is visible in Havel’s abandoned clipboard and the folded hallway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through the coded stanzas and the ocean’s forgetting; no moralizing. Final image of two mapmakers redrawing wind offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in Havel’s “grammar” terror enriches without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: librarian’s cataloguing gaze, synesthetic taste of “spongey dread,” rhythmic control in the stanza decoding. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marla. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“May I borrow tomorrow?”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective (“wet wool clouds,” “hallway tiled with drifting barnacles”). One mixed metaphor—“sensors blinked epileptic red”—is vivid enough to pass. Closure beat is clean of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, meteorology, and necromantic exchange; reversible exile as literal corridor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (midnight disinterment, grammar-as-weather) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes.</comment>
