<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhessa’s “gently persistent” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—her quiet declaration, the unhesitating re-allocation of the last basket, the final bell-ring—so motivation stays legible and intensifies. Interiority is sparse yet specific (“too young to remember free borders, too old to believe they’d return quickly”). The only cap is that the narrator’s own stakes remain observational rather than tested; no personal flaw complicates the final moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned bell drawing a charcoal sketch-donation crystallizes the “echo” economy and forecloses any return to isolation. Causal chain is intact—shortage → plan → grandmother detour → deficit → anonymous refill—each beat tightening options. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of giving and echoing intensifies until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor, moonlit ridge, and embargoed valley are sketched with selective sensory strokes that guide tactics (hidden carts, lantern disguises). The antique bell functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its weight triggers sound, its gleam recalls ritual. One minor slip: spatial distance between ridge and downtown is gestural rather than measured, but it never affects the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep children alive—signaled in Rhessa’s first whisper. Escalation is one deepening: the last basket diverted to the grandmother exposes the three-unit shortfall, tightening the group’s margin. Cost is visible in the empty pouch and the sweat-drenched dawn return. Agency remains collective but choice-point (Rhessa’s diversion) is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of porous exile and echoing kindness emerges through action, never sermon. The bell’s migration from temple relic to clandestine signal to returned offering reweights its meaning without commentary. Final image—“echoes never pay customs”—is earned, resonant, and avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; compression (“hunger stayed, gnawing politely”) teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature is consistent—moonlight “silvered,” clouds “hooded,” silence “layered with ringing.” No POV leakage; the collective “we” stays anchored in the record-keeper’s limited knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and purposeful. One near-mixed metaphor—“air became roomier”—is brief and voice-consistent, not muddling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sanctions-night food-run premise is familiar, yet the “echo economy” of anonymous bell-circulation feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of compost-cart disguise, sheet-music envelopes, and charcoal bell sketch transforms stock material. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
