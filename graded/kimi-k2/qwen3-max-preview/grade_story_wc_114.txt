<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the fevered smudge on the orchid anchors her guilt. The final stance—pinning the drawing to the railing—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor: the oracle’s “poetry” edges toward therapeutic label-speak, blunting contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elira chooses endurance and release, foreclosing silence with visible cost (the orchid left to the storm). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the oracle’s recalibration tightens stakes. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mountain station, wind, and aurora constrain every move; the orchid-as-micro-setting recharges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor spatial drift: “gantry” appears without prior anchor, but the moment’s urgency overrides.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—weight of swallowed truth—tightens via oracle’s recalibration and Elira’s act of exposure. Pressure escalates through pattern break (smudge becomes center) rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the relinquished drawing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the smudge-as-honesty and the oracle’s fault-tolerance metaphor; no moralizing. Final image reweights silence as glacier and truth as breathable weight. Subtext in the orchid’s surrender is resonant and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“alpine rage,” “auroral sorrow”) is consistent. Compression taught early (“chorus of alpine rage”) and paid off. No head-hopping; oracle’s diction remains distinct from Elira’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“wind gnashed,” “tired star”) serve pressure without muddle. One elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing”—slips register but occurs outside peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fault-tolerant oracle as grief counselor, smudge as honesty engine. Risk in lyric abstraction pays off via grounded final gesture. Avoids stock mountain isolation tropes through specificity of instruments and auroral sorrow.</comment>
