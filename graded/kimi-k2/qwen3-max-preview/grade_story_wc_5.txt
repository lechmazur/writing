<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—her knees in permafrost, blood sizzling on frost—but the “translate heartbeats into maps” motive is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to complicate the final stance, so the cost feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object placement tightens the pattern until the copper plate hums, a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—her blood, the warm plate against her ribs—closing the arc without causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subarctic crater, frost-laced bark, fox-fur wrap—every environmental detail constrains posture, temperature, and tool use; the orchard’s silence literally stops time, charging the final image when wind and wolf return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve safekept starlight—escalates through ritual precision; each discarded item raises the ante until the map pulses beneath her palms, a visible price paid in blood and exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of revelation-through-debris emerges organically from action; no moralizing, yet the final image reweights absence into archive, inviting reflection without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined—syntax slows to match ritual patience, then quickens with “steam like tiny hearths”; perceptual signature is consistent, no head-hopping, diction stays within alchemist’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold, metaphors precise (“memory through scar tissue”), high information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: starlight cartography via discarded junk, subarctic silence as ritual chamber; risk-taking (no dialogue, pure lyric) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
