<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (ash on fibers, frost under fingertips), but the shift from survivor to healer is asserted more than dramatized; the ledger’s final re-coding is felt rather than chosen, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns and ledger glyphs braid into a resonant reconfiguration (RR) where “escape route” becomes “healing map.” Closure lands with conceptual cost—the smugglers’ mercy reframed—though physical stakes remain oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon, kiln, and frost are rendered with tactile economy; the frost’s daily metamorphosis constrains her art and ultimately rewrites the ledger’s meaning, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover purpose in the pauses”—tightens through iterative frost study and glasswork; the deepening is accretive rather than sharply contested, but the final re-coding of the ledger delivers felt reweighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation-through-ruin emerges organically from frost, fire, and glass; the ledger’s shift from guilt to map offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to the artist’s perceptual signature; syntax mirrors her patient, iterative attention without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; occasional poetic layering (“drifting resonance”) risks overwriting but stays tethered to sensory ground. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing smuggler ledger, frost cryptography, and glass alchemy yields a fresh synthesis; the canyon as silent witness feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
