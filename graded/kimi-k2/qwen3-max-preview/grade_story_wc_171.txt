<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is rich—her “operatively gentle” cadence and the embodied cost of “burying too many compromises” anchor her arc. The final palm-press seals a credible renunciation with felt cost. Secondary characters remain silhouettes, but the single-POV focus justifies this. No unmotivated epiphanies or therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the triple-moon ritual reconfigures the political into the sacred, cost paid in “ink, memory, and the weight of unkept promises.” Causal linkage holds—every beat flows from Elira’s decision to resurrect ceremony. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Lens is stable Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The volcanic terrace, triple moons, and scent of burnt sage are vivid yet selective, filtering through Elira’s priest-negotiator gaze. The dais and clipboard function as micro-setting that constrains her final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather and celestial motion tighten the ritual clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming failed peace by ritual—is signaled early and tightened when Elira kneels to “offer ink.” The horns summoning both armies crystallize pressure; the thumb-print mosaic is an earned, irreversible trade-off. No coincidence resolves the conflict; cost is visible in the smudged ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: the sacred cannot be separated from the political until both armies witness it. Subtext lives in the silence after the horns, in the smudge of prints becoming a single “imperfect mosaic.” No final-paragraph moralizing; the triple moons reweight the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic cadences that mirror ritual pacing (“slow unfurling of resolve”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Elira notices grain of ebony, scent of sage, weight of vial. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at the palm-press. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes (“shattered remnants of her own conviction”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“operatively gentle”) is voice-motivated. Final line lands clean with image-driven resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of peace negotiation with volcanic ritual feels inevitable yet fresh; the clipboard as sacred relic subverts generic treaty scenes. Specificity—meteorite ink, dove-bone pen—grounds the concept. No close echoes; transformation test passes. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
