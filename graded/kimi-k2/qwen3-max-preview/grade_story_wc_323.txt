<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s “balanced curiosity” is shown in her measured classroom presence and the quiet refusal to sentimentalize the anchor link; her interiority is consistent and embodied. The final choice to mount the link as a compass rather than a relic crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Secondary characters are sketched lightly but serve as crucible for her lesson. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the anchor link is repurposed from dead weight to living compass, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Causal linkage holds—every beat (night in darkness, classroom demonstration, final mounting) follows because/therefore logic under the Causal lens. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the phrase “we are not weights meant to stay put.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The benthic city’s pressure-sealed glass, abyssal vents, and tactile star-charts constrain every choice; the holotank and balcony reappear to charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The anchor link itself functions as micro-setting that alters tactics. One minor slip: “ink-black water” edges cliché, not enough to breach 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—humanity must relearn navigation or remain lost—is signaled early and tightened through the semester’s arc. The power-failure night forces a micro-choice: Elira recites coordinates from memory, proving the method works under existential pressure. Cost is legible—she forfeits nostalgia for utility. Escalation is steady but lacks a single irreversible fork, capping below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: adaptation as moral imperative. The anchor motif evolves from mnemonic to compass without authorial commentary. Subtext resides in silence—students gripping braille charts, city lights dimming. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: “a compass pointing toward horizons yet unfolded.” Avoids moralizing, earns complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, marine-technical yet lyrical; “edge geometry” and “alien transit corridor” feel native to Elira’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped phrases during blackout. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Dialogue is sparse but natural, especially Kael’s question and Elira’s soft reply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“invisible lace” of alien architecture. Sentence variety supports momentum. One near-miss: “somber marvel” appears twice; the repetition is thematic, not artifactual, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of deep-sea survival, non-Euclidean astronomy, and tactile pedagogy feels inevitable and fresh. Risky choice to make GPS obsolete via off-stage aliens pays off through grounded consequence. Anchor link transformed from clichéd symbol to navigational tool. No close echoes of existing works; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
