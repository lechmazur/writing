<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the needle-scars and salt-tongue details root motive in flesh. The final choice to mend rather than burn/bury the plate crystallizes a value hierarchy (ancestral gravity vs. guild rules) with visible cost (scars, sleepless return). Yet the “hauntingly optimistic” label is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice, and the contradiction between dream-logic and deliberate craft could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of sewing rewrites the plate’s fate and the canyon’s memory, reconfiguring ruin into reverence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each stitch thickens pattern until the final pulse. Orientation is taught early via “centuries-old labyrinth” and “after the tide pools empty,” so the dream-walk disorientation serves closure. Cost is legible in the scars and the promise of endless nights of return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The canyon walls, loom, and plate function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only the heart-chamber’s acoustics allow the buried bell to answer; only the plate’s fractures guide the needle. Sensory selection is urgent—salt, orchid, starlight—filtered through the weaver’s tactile priorities. Spatial choreography is clean: barefoot steps, kneeling, cradling the warmed plate. The red stone and emptied tide pools mirror internal emptiness without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to redeem broken precedents without repeating ancestral erasure. Escalation is textural—each stitch intensifies the cost of refusal (guild rules vs. personal vow). The single decisive tightening occurs when she chooses to sew the storm’s thunderbolts back into the plate, foreclosing the option of silence. The price is the open-ended commitment to nightly return until the canyon sings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act: brokenness is not erased but rewoven into sacred blueprint. Subtext lives in the plate’s warmth and the canyon’s shimmer—memory made visible. The final image of the child stepping out with the storm offers a non-literal answer: reverence grows in ruin’s soil. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “stubborn hope” watered by scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is incantatory, compressed, and consistent: “moon-pale intuition,” “ghost of salt on her tongue.” Perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic—dust that tastes of hymns, thread curling like smoke. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to the weaver’s dream-saturated sensorium. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long breaths in description, clipped pulses during stitching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Metaphors are coherent (storm as net hauling constellations) and tied to the maritime loom mythology. No loops or scaffold; redundancy is minimal. Occasional elevated diction (“ancestral gravity,” “cathedral”) is earned by the mythic register. Final cadence slows to crystallize the charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses maritime myth with textile metaphysics in a non-obvious way. The broken plate as palimpsest and the loom strung with whale-song are specific, unrepeatable images. Risk is taken in the dream-logic structure, yet the closure remains legible. The synthesis feels inevitable: shattered things hold their own becoming.</comment>
