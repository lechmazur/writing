<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Artist’s contradictory impulses—mischief vs. scalpel-like intent—are embodied in every micro-choice (swapping grave markers, singing the child’s tremble). Final renunciation of a unified truth is earned by prior refractions and carries visible cost: the spire dissolves, mist of grief released. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “guilt too large for their small frame” drifts toward label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the artist’s refusal to deliver a single truth dissolves the spire, reconfiguring the canyon’s rule-set. Causal chain—each refracted confession thins the mist—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final “I’m sorry” refracted a hundred ways, mist smelling of rain and burnt sugar. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone tower and canyon mist constrain every move—poetry sessions timed to dawn’s drowsy echoes, tower ridge cold under palm. Pale spire’s mist thickens with each regret, then thins to reveal a grief-stricken face, charging the final image. Micro-setting (child’s rusted music box) returns as single clear note. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refuse to feed the spire a unified truth—tightens through each session; mist’s thinning marks rising cost. One decisive deepening: artist offers her own raw regrets, foreclosing the elders’ expected parable. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. Price paid is the spire’s dissolution and the canyon’s chaotic chorus acknowledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: forgiveness is the act of cradling jagged edges without forcing coherence. Subtext lives in gesture—sponge-dipped-in-salt mist, giggles returning as sobs. Final phrase “I’m sorry” refracted a hundred ways offers non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “mist that pulsed like a slow heartbeat,” “salt-dipped sponge.” Syntax mirrors artist’s fracturing intent—staccato refrains, elongated hums. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored. Child’s dialogue is spare, subtextual; artist’s song is pure sound. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” in interior thought feels academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—glass birds nesting in rib cages—never muddle. Rhythm accelerates with ritual bell, then exhales into final whisper. No loops, no scaffold. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she sensed it hungered”) but does not dull peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—truth must be refracted, not unified—feels fresh and inevitable. Bone towers as grief-monument, poetry as scalpel: synthesis is specific. Risk of lyric abstraction paid off by concrete cost. No derivative echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
