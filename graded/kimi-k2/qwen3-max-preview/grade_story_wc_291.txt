<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s face-blindness and tactile memory are vividly embodied; her decision to “remember them properly” crystallizes the arc. The hooded man’s grief is textured through salt-stiff collar and tremor, but his late arrival limits relationship crucible. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation—sketching the killer faceless—earns its cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry becomes a shared stage of mourning, not erasure. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each tactile detail accumulates until the ribbon reweights meaning. The Orientation Test is met by line 3. No teleporting props; masks are found exactly where grief placed them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quarry breathes mist and swallows sound; limestone chill and grit under boots constrain movement and anchor POV. The ribbon’s silver threads catch flame like ore, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—lantern swing, candle placement, glass cases tracked. Environment forces the choice to unseal memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy for the vanished—is signaled early and tightened when Elira pins faceless portraits to stone. Agency is renunciation: she forsakes accusation for shared mourning, foreclosing legal justice with visible social cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from texture vs. erasure: “people vanish twice.” Subtext lives in the tremor of a thumb on velvet, not in stated morals. Final image—faceless sketch of the killer—reweights the premise: memory without sight. No thematic echo; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, consistent: “mist coiling like guilt made visible.” Syntax mirrors Elira’s haptic world. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: “You kept their masks” carries the entire confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “furrowed hush wrapping each word like burial cloth.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with breath in the dark, then exhales at dawn. Line-level craft supports closure without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist + tactile cold-case investigation. Masquerade masks as preserved relics invert the trope of hidden bodies. Risky quiet ending—no courtroom payoff—heightens emotional stakes and lands. Specificity of textile archives and scent memories anchors originality.</comment>
