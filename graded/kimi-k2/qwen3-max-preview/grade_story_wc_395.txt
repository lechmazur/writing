<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—"silence screamed louder than alerts"—and motives (curiosity, guilt, stewardship) tighten through escalating lies; final endurance of silence is earned. Missing only a deeper contradiction in her own psyche to reach 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the 07:07 restore reconfigures the archive’s meaning and her role, cost legible in her perpetual listening. Causal chain (patch → numbers → restore) holds; one minor ellipsis in janitor thread keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Archive’s hum, frosted glass, server glow constrain every move; patch’s scorched thread and reentry burn charge the final silhouette. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal vigilance without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the erased crew—tightens through each recurrence of 07:07; final restore narrows her future to perpetual listening, price paid on-page. Escalation is steady, coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of persistence-in-absence emerges from cadence of deleted songs and negative space; final image of humming silence reweights all prior loss without moralizing. Subtext in her daily lies sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, rhythmic, and specific—“mausoleum of deleted posts”—with no head-hopping. Compression like “She lied to herself” teaches the pattern early; final whisper in monitor flicker pays it off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—“files didn’t ‘go’ anywhere… they unraveled”—with zero loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“resonance chamber”) is minor; clarity at closure remains pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ghost-in-the-machine with cold-case noir feels inevitable; crew-as-negative-space is fresh and fully committed. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
