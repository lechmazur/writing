<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembled,” “voice rough as torn sheet music”), but the apology’s motivation is asserted more than dramatized; the micro-choice to wire the perfume bottle is specific and costly, earning the rapprochement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the scent-memory braid tightens stakes until the manuscript hand-off crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands with felt cost (“the orchard waited”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive and orchard are filtered through sensory bias (“yellowed paper,” “damp earth”), and the perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains the final gesture; spatial choreography is clean, though the Restoration Room could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can apology resurrect trust?—tightens via the scented re-enactment; the tightening is one deepening, not escalation, fitting the lens. Cost is visible: public humiliation reversed by private restitution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect grace emerges from the flawed symphony and bruised jasmine; no moralizing, only the reweighted silence after the scent fades. The final image (“orchard waited”) offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed metaphors, rhythmic control, no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext (“I hated being misunderstood more”) and differs in cadence from narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“mausoleum of melodies”) fits the archivist POV; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip-column exorcist + perfume-based memory séance; tropes transformed through Elias’s manuscript and the orchard’s looming loss. Risky structure pays off in a quiet, earned stasis.</comment>
