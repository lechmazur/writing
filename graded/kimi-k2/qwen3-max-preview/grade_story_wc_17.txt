<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“listened…with the hollow behind her ribs”), motives deepen from talisman to witness, but the decisive act of leaving the sketch feels slightly under-motivated relative to the weight of what she has absorbed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she renounces archival ownership and entrusts the legacy back to the walls; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the pattern taught early and paid off in the final exhale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy, hearth, and negative strip act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; spatial choreography is clean, sensory selection purposeful, though a touch more tactile navigation would push it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“what walls dream about” and the burden of legacy—tighten through the discovery of the diaries; the deepening is felt, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of witnessing; the final image of the passage exhaling offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the question of forgiveness without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a consistent perceptual signature; compression and elision are taught early and remain legible; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is controlled and purposeful; one minor loop (“curled like unborn birds…curled at the edges”) is the only blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “echo cartographer” premise is fresh; the synthesis of post-climate ruin, architectural memory, and inherited perception feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
