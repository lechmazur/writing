<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“scratches from brambles, burns from spectral touch”), but the medium’s contradictory impulses remain largely poetic rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice is credible and earned, yet the cost is more lyrical than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unsent letters dissolve, the shard sinks, and the path opens—cost is legible in the memory-for-healing trade and the irreversible letting-go. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth is vividly tactile and constrains movement (“aerial roots tightening like fingers around time”); the leaf-windows reappear in the final image to reweight meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the moment before deciding—tightens through embodied pressure and culminates in the irreversible release of the letters; agency is clear, cost is felt, though external opposition remains spectral rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges through concrete particulars (letters, shard, leaf-windows) without moralizing; final droplet tasting of “salt and forgiveness” offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (“salt-thick air,” “green embrace”); no head-hopping, compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical but disciplined; occasional purple tinge (“frozen regret”) is offset by high information density and zero loops. Metaphors cohere and accelerate toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic shard, living mangrove windows, and moon-for-memory economy; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact elements.</comment>
