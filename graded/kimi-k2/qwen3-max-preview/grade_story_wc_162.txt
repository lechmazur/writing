<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile reading of wood grain and the micro-choice to step off the terrace crystallize her arc. The father’s sacrifice is felt through her body, not exposition. Minor drift: “featherly determined” is asserted rather than enacted until the final leap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s dissolution into light reweights the premise of thresholds as living memory. Causal chain (bench → logbook → maze → vanishing) holds; each object cues the next beat. Orientation is taught early via the bleeding prism mist. Cost is legible in the creaking bench’s “sigh.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drifting prism terrace, warped bench, and glowing maze below constrain every choice; even the logbook is fused to a cliff, anchoring physics. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and light, mirroring Elara’s method. Final image recharges the terrace’s rainbow mist as the threshold she becomes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—tightens when the logbook reveals consecration through surrender. One decisive deepening: realizing her father became the maze’s geometry. Cost is the irreversible dissolution of her body into that same geometry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sacredness as geometry emerges from wood grain, logbook metaphors, and the final vanishing—never stated. Thematic resonance is carried by the bench’s grief and the maze’s glow, reweighted when Elara becomes distance itself. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“featherly determined,” “bleeding rainbow mist”). POV stays tight to Elara; no head-hopping. Compression (“Thresholds remember”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic grain-reading.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” moment is earned. Final paragraph maintains clarity amid dissolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the missing parent into living architecture. Corn-maze-as-memory and logbook-as-weather-code feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky dissolution ending pays off by recharging every prior image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
