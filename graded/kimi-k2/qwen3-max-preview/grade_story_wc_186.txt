<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“thistle-blown hope”); micro-choices (prism angle, chalk marks) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation intensifies from passive listening to active conduit. Final renunciation of “wandering” for “summoned” carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, so 9+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—custodian sees herself as receiver, not wanderer. Causal linkage: star-pulse → prism → vision → stance shift. Cost is loss of prior self-narrative. Drive lens (Causal) holds without contradiction; persistent constraint (fragile alignment) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion constrains every move—crunching silica, strained panes, harmonic floor. Micro-setting (prism tripod) enables decisive alignment. Sensory hierarchy (wind, salt, thistle) filtered through custodian’s urgency. Final image of refracted light charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences have meaning—tightens via prism calibration; one misstep collapses vision. Escalation: first star-pulse → harmonic rise → memory cascade → self-revelation. Cost: fragile rekindling could fail at any moment. Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: shard of hush, star paths, thistles. Final image of “broken things can rekindle wonder” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in “pregnant pause between despair and decision.” Resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “glass humming pavilion,” “frozen tear,” “ghost-trails.” Perceptual signature is custodian’s—astrolabe precision, wind taste. No head-hopping; POV stable. Compression taught early (“low, resonant moan”) and paid off in harmonic chorus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors precise (“pregnant pause,” “thistle-blown hope”). Rhythm accelerates with harmonic rise. Minor elevated diction (“retrocognitively”) fits scholarly POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-collapse astrolabe mysticism, retrocognitive prism, thistle-hope tone. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test: story fails without these exact elements. No derivative echoes.</comment>
