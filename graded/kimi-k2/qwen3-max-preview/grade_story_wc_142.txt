<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (order vs. anarchy) are embodied in every micro-choice—mapping chaos, painting murals, pocketing the stone—yet the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed; the “ache” is told more than dramatized in the climax beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural atop the tilt-a-whirl crystallizes the city’s stance, foreclosing privatization with visible communal cost. Causal chain from graffiti tactics to postponed contracts is tight; only a faint ellipsis between dawn gathering and stalled privatization keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Neon, salt-stained wood, popcorn carts, and surveillance drones are filtered through Lira’s tactical gaze; the raft city’s planks and pontoons literally constrain where luxury housing can rise, charging the final mural. Sensory economy is near-perfect, though one or two “carnival” placeholders could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. gentrification—is signaled early and tightened through each graffiti intervention; the final communal stand narrows options and exacts the cost of postponed, not defeated, privatization. Escalation is steady but leans accumulative rather than a single decisive reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unownership emerges from Lira’s acts and images (clown with lease, phoenix from kernels) without a single overt statement; the final map-mural reweights the premise, leaving complexity intact. Subtext in graffiti parables and children’s humming is rich and unforced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature—salt, sugar, spreadsheets—throughout. Syntax mirrors her orderly intuition in calm beats and compresses under pressure (“she paints swiftly…”) without head-hop or register drift. Voice is distinctive and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“contracts slither…like eels”) and never muddies causality. Minor scaffold in the carnival hymn repetition is negligible and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The floating carnival as gentrification battleground feels inevitable yet fresh; graffiti-as-tactical-language transforms familiar tropes. Specificity of popcorn-cart phoenix and origami-crane eviction notices creates an indelible micro-mythology. Risky structure pays off.</comment>
