<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “quiet intensity” and tactile memory of poems give him specificity. The contradiction between carving grief and needing to join it is dramatized in the final ribbon beat. Silas’s silent guidance is credible ghost-mentorship, never explanatory. Cost is felt when Elias ties the last ribbon and accepts perpetual apprenticeship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each ribbon added and epitaph begun layers density until the crimson ribbon triggers resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias smiles between hammer strikes, acknowledging unending labor—cost legible in “no longer carving alone.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse’s iron rafters, moss-slick flagstones, and migrating butterflies are filtered through Elias’s stone-carver gaze; every sensory note serves the grief-mapping goal. The loom-like rafters physically constrain where ribbons can hang, shaping the final tableau. Micro-setting (chisel, marble dust, lemon tree) acts as extension of body and memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: how to transmute communal grief into living stone. Escalation is incremental—each new ribbon and ghost-guided stroke tightens the obligation to keep carving. The final crimson ribbon crystallizes the cost: perpetual service. No external antagonist; pressure is the accumulating weight of names and poems.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as migratory current, stone as vessel, ribbons as communal loom. Subtext lives in gesture—spectral hand on shoulder, butterfly landing on ribbon—never in exposition. Final image reweights the premise: grief is not void but shared flight. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the hush between mallet strikes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature: “syllable by syllable, stanza by stanza.” Syntax mirrors stone work—chiseled, precise, occasionally lyric. No head-hopping; Silas remains externalized, sensed only through touch and wrist guidance. Rhythm modulates from meditative hush to thunder-calm cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“bruised hues of twilight”) is justified by Elias’s poetic lineage. No loops or scaffold; each verb is exact. Final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gravestone craft, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels inevitable yet fresh. Ribbon-as-loom reframes memorial practice without gimmickry. Specificity of “whistled while fixing engines” epitaphs grounds the fantastical. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in a quiet, earned closure that reconfigures grief as communal flight.</comment>
