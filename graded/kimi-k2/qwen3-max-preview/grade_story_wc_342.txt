<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between tactile genius and facial blindness drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—choosing to finish the sky rather than flee—earns its cost through prior texture-memory. Minor slip: the laugh feels slightly abstract rather than earned. Still, character coherence under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single-scene arc holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as dawn and demolition crystallize stakes. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each tactile translation of the coin’s grooves tightens the pattern until the cosmos blooms. Cost is legible in the irreversible stillness of the final sit. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<comment>The hollowed tree-trunk library is both crucible and canvas; its imminent erasure forces the act. Micro-setting (coin, ceiling bark) constrains every brushstroke. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through tactile bias—light is “felt” as pressure. One minor echo: “moss-crusted doors” repeats texture motif without new work.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate the coin’s sky before obliteration—tightens once: crews idle, dawn bruises. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and temporal. Escalation is a density accrual of pigment and time, not a causal turn. The cost is the irreversible loss of the only witness; felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of blindness into hyper-acute perception; no explicit statement. The final image—the artist smiling beneath an unseen sky—reweights the premise: absence becomes atmosphere. Subtext lives in touch replacing sight. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and rhythmically controlled: “fractally precise accuracy, each pore and lash a map.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hop. Diction stays within the artist’s perceptual lexicon—no visual clichés. Final cadence slows to match stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise: “dawn bled through leaves like watercolor on vellum.” One micro-slip: “ghost-light of dead astronomers” edges toward poetic excess but is earned by prior restraint.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind artist mapping cosmos by touch—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (doomed library, secret relic) are transformed through tactile epistemology. Risk: entire climax is internal, yet stakes remain legible. Specificity of coin grooves as star-charts is non-obvious and integral.</comment>
