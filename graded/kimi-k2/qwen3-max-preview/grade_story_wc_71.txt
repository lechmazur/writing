<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The noticer’s interiority is textured and embodied—“hushed blaze” in her ribs, bare feet on damp pavement. Motivation is rooted in a specific, idiosyncratic quest: to feel houses as living presences. Micro-choice—placing the orris shard—carries visible cost: she relinquishes the relic to the tide. No contradictory impulses on the page, but the arc is more observational than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dissolution sanctifies the lingering cottage, releasing its ghostly grip. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of placement, memory, and scent intensifies to a final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are seamless. Cost is legible in the shard’s loss and the irrevocable letting-go.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bay, reeds, tide, moss-slick stone are vivid, selective, and filtered through the noticer’s bias. The orris root itself becomes micro-setting, constraining her ritual choice. Streetlights “daydreaming” is purposeful personification that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the trapped cottage—is signaled early and tightened by the shard’s placement. Agency is ritual action, not confrontation; pressure deepens as the hush thickens and the ghost house “unclenches.” Cost is the shard’s dissolution and the irreversible farewell. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as architecture, sanctification as love beyond time. Subtext pulses in the shard’s “humming with memory” and the houses that “hold their breath.” Final image reweights the premise—loss as act of grace—without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the creep of normality is not defeated but companioned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“salt-kissed,” “ghost-notes of violet”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush. Perceptual signature is distinct: scent as structure, silence as shard. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV lexicon. Patterned elision (“she whispered nothing aloud, but thought in textures”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors or purple drift. Minor loop risk in “hush” repetitions, but cadence is purposeful. Final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—sanctifying forgotten houses through displaced scent-objects—is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes of haunted architecture and ritual offering are transformed via olfactory memory. Specificity of orris root and chamomile tea grounds the fantastical in lived detail. Risk-taking succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
