<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Operator’s interiority is concrete—thumb on disc, misrouting as ritual—yet her contradictory impulse (self-looped call) arrives as summary, not dramatized choice, softening the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the operator loops her own voice into the archive, turning tool into tomb; causality holds under Accumulative lens, cost legible in “the call never ended.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Condensation-weeping walls and ozone air are selective and purposeful; the glass disc as micro-setting constrains her final act, charging the resonant fade-out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching endings to begin—tightens when she applies the method to herself; the price is the eternal loop, though the escalation is more tonal than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated estrangement emerges from collisions, not assertion; final image reframes prior wrong numbers as self-inflicted, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature—“air tasted of iron and ozone”—remains consistent; purposeful elision (“between the hum of streetlamps”) teaches the cadence and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; no loops or mixed metaphors; final sentence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of misrouting grief through wrong numbers feels fresh; synthesis of glass harmonica as emotional archive is non-obvious yet inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
