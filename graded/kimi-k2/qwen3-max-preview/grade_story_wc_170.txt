<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The painter’s interiority is richly embodied—her listening “with the hollow between her ribs” and the tactile return of the heartbeat—but the absence of on-page contradiction or visible cost in her final renunciation keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors fracture into possibility while the heartbeat is released, a felt cost made legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly from the first prism glint to the last bell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism parapet and terrace are not mere backdrop; their wet stone and refracted light literally shape the painter’s method and the mirrors’ revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—persuading mirrors to reveal possibility—tightens through each spectral bloom until the final reconfiguration forecloses the painter’s presence; the cost is the vanishing itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of returning a child’s heartbeat amplified; the ending’s quiet vanishing offers a non-literal answer to how hope is seeded without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature—sound felt in bone, light tasted in mist—without ever slipping register; the cadence modulates perfectly with the hush before bells.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances image or stakes; figurative language is disciplined, never overwriting the prism’s logic. Zero loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The borrowed heartbeat as paint, mirrors as reluctant confessors, and coded lullabies cohere into a fresh mythic economy that feels inevitable yet wholly new.</comment>
