<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence, grief, and caretaker impulse are embodied in every micro-choice (humming, stone-cairn ritual, refusal to read letters). The final stacking of stones crystallizes a credible renunciation: he chooses anonymous service over personal voice, paying the cost of continued solitude. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The sea-glass anchor and stone-message act as externalized contradiction between memory and forward motion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc: dock → climb → blackout → stone ritual → lamp rekindles. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lamp’s return glow reconfigures the meaning of Elias’s silence—his tending now carries communal weight. Causality is accumulative/textural: each object (glass, stones, letters) layers until the blackout forces the decisive stacking. Cost is the ache of unspoken love made luminous. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<comment>Blackwick Point’s salt, rust, and “ghost-light” are filtered through Elias’s professional eye and widower’s heart. The lantern room’s cold iron and cobwebbed glass physically constrain his ritual; the western window sill becomes micro-setting where stones and sea-glass charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under blackout: touch of smooth stones, pulse of glass against ribs. Weather and architecture guide the stacking choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve a fragile chain of wordless hope. Pressure tightens when the spectral lamp snuffs—Elias must act without speech. Agency: he converts private grief into public signal via stone-cairn code, paying the cost of remaining unheard. No external antagonist; the sea’s indifference and his own silence supply coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: anonymous caretaking as antidote to personal loss. Subtext lives in the gap between the letters he ferries and the ones he’ll never write. The sea-glass and stone-cairn reprise reweight “bottled safety” into communal beacon without moralizing. Final image—humming under starlight—offers non-literal answer: shared loneliness transmuted into quiet light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Elias’s reticent, salt-stained perception. Syntax is spare, cadence oceanic; “velvet dark,” “feathered tax collectors” feel organic to a man who thinks in tides. No dialogue; silence itself becomes voice. Compression is purposeful—ellipses of speech heighten the stone-message’s eloquence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “creak of rusted gears, sigh of wind through broken panes” carries triple duty (setting, mood, theme). No loops, no scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors climb-descent arc. Metaphors are precise and physically grounded; no mixed vehicles. High information density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-lighthouse trope is inverted: keeperless tower tended by a mute ferryman of hope. Stone-cairn semaphore and anonymous letter chain feel fresh because rooted in Elias’s specific loss. Risk lies in quietness—no spectacle, only resonance. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
