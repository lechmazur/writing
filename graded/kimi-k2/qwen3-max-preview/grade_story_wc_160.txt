<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The machinist is vividly embodied from the first line, contradictions in rigor/mercy flare live in the trembles at “weeping eye” and “volcano’s warmth”; her final sly recalibration is earned and the cost is felt in her dappled resolve without a single explanatory word.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens, taught early by the chain’s “footmark once paced by engineers who wept”; closure is a charged poise—harmonic ratios covertly injected into the floodgate software—whose social cost is legible in the image of “mercy moving the gears.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amphibitheater’s geothermal breath physically constrains her humming calibration and its warm ribs end up as the blueprint; tight spatial tracking from “cracked marble floor” to “amber fracture” never wavers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compassion vs control—tightens toward the crack glowing amber; no coincidences, just sharpening pressure ending in her covert reprogramming with palpable, if invisible, cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through tactile ritual: etched erosion as mercy only she deciphers; final image of “slyest, most heartfelt victory” reweights earlier stones and chains without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singular, lush first-person interior held steady across lyric compression; distinct metaphors—“volcano’s breath” to “moss in shadow”—stand tuned to her machinist perception, never drifting outside her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence music varies with her pulse; not one loop, zero mixed metaphors, information stacked efficiently in “Each foot... map sorrow” and “volcano’s warmth seep into her bones.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—hydraulic engineering choreographed by volcanic acoustics to encode mercy in firmware—is fresh, inevitable, and never gimmickry.</comment>
