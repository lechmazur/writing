<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied (“volcanic tenderness,” “cracked amphorae”); the arsonist past is not just backstory but a flaw that drives the present mission and the final choice to become “destroyer and savior.” Contradictory impulses—guilt, awe, ancestral duty—co-exist in the same beats, culminating in an earned renunciation of her fugitive identity. The cost is felt in the closing smile that accepts perpetual exile above ground.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive sings, walls dissolve, and she steps into the role of “archivist of the unspoken.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each artistic breadcrumb increases density until the final tapestry reweights the entire quest. The cost is explicit in the obsidian seal she breaks and the irreversible exposure of her lineage. Pattern taught early (first breadcrumb at ~15%) and paid off at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The volcanic archive is not backdrop but active constraint: glyphs glow at her touch, doors sigh open, tremors respond to her presence. Micro-setting (cracked dome, petrified ink air) constrains movement and supplies tools (lapis, volcanic glass). Final image of “throat of the earth” charges the closure with literal and metaphorical depth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—tightens through escalating artistic acts that foreclose anonymity. Each portrayal narrows her escape options; the final act of pressing her palm to the portrait crystallizes the irreversible cost of becoming the archive’s voice. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of destruction as preservation; no direct statement, only the image of ember-trails guiding others “not to ruin, but to remembrance.” Subtext in the vandalized portrait’s missing half forces the reader to intuit the unsaid. Final lullaby of ash offers a non-literal answer: memory survives only if someone consents to burn for it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with volcanic diction (“petrified ink,” “crushed lapis”) that mirrors the protagonist’s analytical intuition. Compression and elision (“She vanished…”) are taught early and paid off in the final dissolve. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality. Rhythm accelerates with tremors and light-dissolve. Minor scaffold (“she began to portray…”) is functional compression, not redundancy.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of arsonist-as-archivist, tapestry-as-mirror, and volcanic archive as memory-womb is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes; the lineage-memory covenant feels freshly wrought.</comment>
