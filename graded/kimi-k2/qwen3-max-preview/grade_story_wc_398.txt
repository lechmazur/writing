<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning vs. acceptance of mismatch—is embodied in the burned letter and vineyard imagery; Mara’s brittle resistance and softening feel earned. The micro-choice of offering his hand without pulling her up crystallizes his trait. The final renunciation (no reconciliation) carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: Mara’s interiority is slightly less textured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the space between them becomes “a vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive.” Causal lens holds: every beat flows from Elias’s gentle persuasion and Mara’s refusal-to-reconsider arc. Cost is legible in the burned letter tucked away as map, not relic. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion’s light, gnarled oak, and frost-tightened grapes constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (vine rows as relational metaphor) is handled with tactile specificity. Weather and season mirror emotional stakes without cliché. One minor drift: “woodsmoke clinging to her coat” is vivid but not re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—can mismatched love be honored without merging?—tightens through Elias’s guided walk and Mara’s reluctant re-evaluation. One deepening: the frost-sweetened grape reweights the premise. Agency remains with Elias; cost is the relinquishment of reunion. Pressure escalates under causal lens without coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: asymmetry as generative, not tragic. The vineyard metaphor reconfigures “destined mismatches” from failure to invitation. Subtext in Mara pocketing the burned edge as map avoids moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature (“weathered hands,” “honeyed light”). Dialogue carries subtext (“You always did talk like poetry wrapped in dirt”). No head-hopping; Mara’s interiority is inferred through gesture and silence. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive”) is precise and earned. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV priorities. One near-repeat: “amber pavilion glowing” appears twice but serves tonal echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: burned love letter as compass, vineyard as relational ethics. Tropes of lost love and autumn dusk are transformed through grounded viticulture detail. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable. Slight risk in quiet ending is justified by earned resonance.</comment>
