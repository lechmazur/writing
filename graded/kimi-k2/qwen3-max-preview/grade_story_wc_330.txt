<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “silence was his native tongue” is evocative yet not embodied. No contradictory impulses on-page; choices feel fated rather than wrestled. The final smile is earned by accumulated texture, not by a visible cost paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the carousel turns under silent song, halo fragment crowned, world reweighted. Causality is textural/accumulative; the wrong turn and dream-chime pattern teach the lens early. Orientation is clear by line 5; no spatial drift. Cost is felt in lifelong solitude, though stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Valley, train, carousel, mist—each detail is selective and sensory. The halo fragment and wind bells act as micro-settings that constrain the final act of “singing.” Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Atmosphere modulates from hush to shimmering note, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to finish the abandoned beauty. Pressure tightens through each stroke of chisel and sandpaper; no external antagonist needed. Agency is quiet endurance; cost is lifetime of silence. One deepening: first horse moves, confirming the wager.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: silence as generative, not absence. Motifs of halos, wind bells, and carousel return with shifted weight. Final image reconfigures “ruin” into “cathedral” without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and object avoids explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, rhythmically controlled—long sentences breathe with sanding strokes, short ones chime. POV stays tight to the carpenter; no head-hop. Diction is consistent, elevated yet grounded in carpentry. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, yet propulsive; every line advances image or motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“cathedral of whimsy”) risks purple but stays within voice. Final cadence lands clean, no artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent carpenter revives circus carousel with halo fragment and wind-bell song—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (abandoned circus, mute artist) are transformed through tactile detail and spiritual stakes. Specificity of carved manes and caramel ghosts anchors universals. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
