<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent; the guardian’s contradictory impulses (silence vs. action) play out in tactile micro-choices. Motivation is rooted in memory of the boy and crystallizes in the final renunciation—her refusal to speak or intervene beyond light-weaving carries visible cost. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV depth is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drowned woman’s slower, gentler sink reconfigures the stake from rescue to witness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of shutter-glyphs taught early, tightened at Lock Nine, and paid off in the final image. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and rusted awning are vivid and selective; the dental mirror and iron shutters constrain every tactical choice. Micro-setting (mirror, grates) charges the final image—mirror’s gleam becomes the star that pierces clouds. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: darkness must learn stars’ value. Pressure escalates via pattern density—each shutter tilt narrows light into glyphs that reweight the drowned woman’s path. Agency remains with guardian; cost is the starlight she spends and the silence she keeps. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: darkness as audience, not enemy. Subtext in silence and mirror-light avoids moralizing; final image of unbroken starlight reweights premise without statement. Memory of the boy provides thematic spine; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature in “bruised clouds,” “liquid silver,” and “spiralingly calm” is consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadence for calm, clipped shutter-clicks for action. No dialogue; silence is voice. Elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or choice. Metaphors (“drowned sapphire,” “hope’s geometry”) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—canal guardian weaving starlight for the drowned—is fresh synthesis of mythic and urban. Dental mirror as soul-catcher and shutter-glyphs as language invert rescue tropes. Specificity of “Bridge Seven” and “Sunday’s best” grounds invention. Risk-taking (silence as dialect) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
