<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied deafness and tactile musicianship are vivid; the pivot from numbness to catalyst is earned through the needle experiment. Interiority is concrete, but the “numbness” label flirts with diagnostic shorthand. Micro-choice (rigging the reversed Bach) crystallizes her value hierarchy and costs her prior serenity. Students’ reactions are sketched rather than individuated, yet the relational crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s silence becomes charged, communal, irreversible. Causal chain (needle → reversed Bach → rupture → shared tremor) is tight; each beat narrows Elara’s isolation and widens collective risk. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image: the broken needle enshrined as “scalpel,” hush now “radiant.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cedar-ribbed cavern, resin scent, and hanging drumskins are selective and functional; they resonate physically when the backward Bach plays. Micro-setting (floor vibrations, lantern glow) constrains how Elara and students perceive the rupture. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room drift. Final image of the needle resting on the drumskin charges the entire space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s fight against her own numbness—is signaled early and escalates through the needle experiment. One decisive tightening: the reversed song forces collective exposure, trading her private sanctuary for communal catharsis. Cost is felt in the luminous, no-longer-muted silence. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as both wound and instrument emerges through action, never thesis. Subtext lives in tactile detail and inverted Bach. Final image reweights the premise: silence now “radiant,” no longer absence but potential. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the charged hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s tactile perception; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her rhythmic focus: “fingertips pressed to drumskins, through vibrations trembling up her spine.” Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual; signing “Again” lands as action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“notes collapsed into their origins”) are precise and earned. Rhythm accelerates with the rupture, then breathes into the luminous silence. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf healer weaponizes reversed Bach to weaponize silence itself. Tropes of trauma therapy and found-object art are transformed through tactile musicianship. Specificity of cedar staves, resin scent, and broken needle grounds the concept. Risky inversion of music-as-therapy pays off with undeniable closure.</comment>
