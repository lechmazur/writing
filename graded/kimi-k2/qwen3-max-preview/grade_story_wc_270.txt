<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The insurgent grandmother’s motives (evolving tradition, refusal of silence) are clear and embodied; her final “Choose” is a credible renunciation of control that costs her sole guardianship of destiny. Interiority is textured (“knuckles…gnarled from decades of weaving resistance”) and her telepathy is shown constraining choice (vines answer, guide her). Flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page—risk feels one-note. Still, the earned cost lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo dissolves into mist, seeding possibility rather than power—cost is the surrender of singular destiny. Causal chain (glyph → chant → amber bloom → diffusion) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no prop teleport. Minor ellipsis: how she knew the chant would work is elided, but pattern teaches plant-response early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs anchor every beat—steam curls around knuckles, obsidian stone warms, sulfurous vents cue plant-speech. Micro-setting (amber on stone) constrains the unsealing ritual. Sensory hierarchy favors heat and scent over sight, matching urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent tradition’s erasure by reseeding destiny into many. Tightening occurs when the amber cracks and she must relinquish sole possession; the cost is visible (amber gone, power diffused). Agency drives every beat—decoding, chanting, offering. No coincidence resolves; vines answer because she called.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: destiny must be chosen, not implanted. Subtext in plant-whispers and glyph-script resists didacticism. Final mist-image reweights “implanted destiny” into shared possibility without moralizing. Complexity lingers—no tidy triumph, only recalibration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the grandmother; perceptual signature is tactile-thermal (“steam curling around knuckles”). Syntax lengthens during chant, mirroring incantatory rhythm. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Compression (“seventeen moons”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Metaphors are coherent (vines “brush thoughts like moss”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits reflective beats. Clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of insurgent grandmother, plant-telepathy, and implanted destiny feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (chosen-one seed, wise elder) are inverted: power is dispersed, not claimed. Specificity of glyph-kite and volcanic springs grounds the mythic frame. Risky quiet ending pays off.</comment>
