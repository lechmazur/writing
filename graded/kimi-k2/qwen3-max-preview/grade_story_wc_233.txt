<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—her bare feet remembering palace marble, the apology in each step—but the “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than embodied; the climactic choice to descend as “witness” feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete micro-choice that dramatizes the cost of that renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the grotto’s revelation reconfigures her identity from ruler to vessel, with the starlight’s scorch/soothe as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers memory until the final shift—though the causal trigger (“you chose power over pulse”) is delivered by an expository figure rather than dramatized action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Ember Grotto and bleeding starlight are rendered with tactile specificity—cobalt veins, mercury tears—while the ridge’s frost-cobwebs and lichen-slick stone constrain her climb. The setting’s warmth and ozone scent at the summit materially alter her stance, charging the final image of starlight clinging like living lace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unburying her buried self—escalates through the climb’s physical cost and the grotto’s forced confrontation with memory. The tightening is legible: ascent strips away royal trappings, descent demands a new role. The price (loss of queenly identity) is visible, though voiced more than enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of silencing poets and self is paid in bleeding starlight. The final image—starlight bleeding through her words—reweights the Edict of Silence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (burned scrolls, bare feet) and the grotto’s refusal to punish, only reveal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and a perceptual signature attuned to texture—velvet vs. linen, lichen vs. marble. Syntax modulates with stress: shorter clauses on the climb, cathedral-ruin cadence in dialogue. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “dusk curling its fingers around the kingdom’s spine” compresses time and menace. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial fire”) risks register drift but stays within the queen’s mythic register. No loops or scaffold; each image advances pressure or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The starlight-as-memory conceit feels fresh, reframing cosmic imagery as personal guilt. The queen’s climb-as-unburial inverts the heroic ascent trope. Specificity (cobalt fireflies, mercury wine) grounds the fantastical in sensory truth, avoiding generic fantasy templates.</comment>
