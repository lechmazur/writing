<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is vivid—cassock of tape, palette of indigo—but the possession remains abstract; we feel his doubt yet never see a concrete choice that costs him something palpable. His final renunciation is elegant but emotionally muffled, so the change reads more conceptual than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a precise Conceptual Repricing: the possession is not expelled but dissolved into the very silence it sought to own, and the cost is the priest’s emptied palette and deeper solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rhetorical question layers pressure until the glyph and inverted question-mark suction reconfigure the rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is evoked through texture—gravity whispers, walls shimmer—yet remains spatially coherent; the palette and silence function as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the possession from completing—is signaled early and tightened by each successive question; the cost is the priest’s relinquishment of certainty itself. Agency is exercised through rhetorical deconstruction, and the price is legible in the emptied indigo and deeper silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of epistemology and ontology: the danger of unexamined assumptions is dramatized, not stated. The final image of silence as cathedral reweights every prior beat without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; the syntax mirrors the looping, recursive action. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final glyph and sideways drop of indigo. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and priest-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Minor loop risk in repeated “silence” phrasing is offset by rhythmic variation and high information density. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of loop-pedal priest, indigo palette, and rhetorical exorcism is startling yet inevitable. The inversion of possession-as-answer feels fresh and grounded in the story’s own logic. Risky structure pays off with crystalline closure.</comment>
