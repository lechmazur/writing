<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—fear calcified into purpose, heartbeat synced to tide—yet the girl’s contradictory impulses (listen vs. act) stay submerged; her final retreat crystallizes a stance without tidy epiphany. Motivation is rooted in generational betrayal and embodied through the fob. Micro-choices (dropping coin, dangling brass) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is felt in the silence after trust snaps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV; causality tight: each feint (disguise, stumble, fob touch) narrows options until the brass disc triggers recognition that dissolves the truce. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—trust breaks in silence, girl walks away with earned stasis. No orientation drift; anchors (salt-rotted pier, lanterns) appear early. Cost is legible in Marla’s frozen exhale and Chain’s retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pier Seven’s groaning timbers, singing eels, and moth-eaten sails are selective and pressure-driven; the brass fob itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy skews to tactile (salt, cold brass) under stealth. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—girl’s knee drop, crate edge, gap between dealers. Environment guides choice: crowd noise masks steps, lantern sway times breaths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the deal before sunrise—tightens via each failed disguise and the ticking watch. One meaningful turn: fob’s touch ruptures the truce without violence. Agency is listening-as-intervention; cost is the audible snap of trust and the girl’s self-exile into darkness. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each misdirection buys seconds, final act buys silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited betrayal emerges through objects (fob, shark-tooth coat) and silences rather than statement. Subtext in Marla’s freeze and Chain’s hiss carries the weight of past truces. Final image—girl melting backward into dark—reweights the premise: silence now costs the betrayers, not the betrayed. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-rough, rhythmic, compressed: “laughter laced with menace,” “tar poured over whispers.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through stealth—sound of boot click, weight of brass. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly bounded. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “Lighthouse blood” condenses history and accusation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances stealth or stakes. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates with heartbeats and slows with the final backward walk. No loops or scaffold; “salt-rotted shadows,” “ghost-tick inside” are precise and earned. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar pirate-market trope is transformed by the girl’s non-violent, listening-based sabotage and the heirloom fob as memory-trigger. Risk taken in quiet climax—trust breaks in silence, not duel. Specificity of Harbor Wars blood-truces and lighthouse blood feels lived-in. Fresh angle: betrayal weaponized as silence, not steel.</comment>
