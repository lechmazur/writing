<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira’s spectral presence is compelling, but her interiority remains abstract; the settlers’ shift from refugees to kin is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No single settler is granted enough page-time to embody contradictory impulses or pay a visible cost. The “strangely trustworthy” aura is stated, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the nebula appears as earned Resonant Reconfiguration—collective unity crystallized by bell and chalk. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of messages → bell → nebula holds without contradiction. Cost is felt in the orchard’s “sigh” and the departure itself. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, upside-down orchards, and violet root-veins are vivid yet selective; each detail serves mood or stakes. The Glass Canopy and bell act as micro-settings that constrain the final ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. The nebula’s shimmer recharges the setting as sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—survival via collective exodus—is signaled early and tightened by thinning bounty. One meaningful escalation: bell summons nebula only when unified. Agency is collective, renouncing the orchard with visible communal cost. No reversals, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of chosen family and orchestrated trust emerges through chalk, bell, and nebula—never stated. Subtext in “she reminds. Of who they’d been” carries weight. Final image of walking together reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers: orchard proud yet left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Lyric third-person omniscient stays consistent; perceptual signature is lush, mythic, yet precise (“spectral tears,” “gravity-marbles”). No head-hopping; collective “they” focalization is stable. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest at bell chime. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“chime like liquid glass”) are apt and brief. High information density without clutter. Final cadence breathes naturally into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Orchard planet with upside-down trees and spectral orchestration feels fresh; tropes of ghost guide and sanctuary nebula are transformed through communal agency. Specificity—“petrified root-veins,” “seed-song”—anchors the fantastical. Risk in lyric collective POV pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
