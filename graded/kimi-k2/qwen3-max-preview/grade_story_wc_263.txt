<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears froze on her cheeks”), but the arc leans on thematic exposition rather than a decisive micro-choice; the final surrender is felt yet not a clear renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the aurora-lit release of chained souls reweights the premise with visible cost (her collapse, spent tears). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of meteor-tracing taught early and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archway and aurora constrain her posture and timing; the brass instrument’s warmth and lens become tactile extensions of body. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal fatigue without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—tightens when the chorus of voices turns furious; her tracing action narrows to a single exhausting burst that forecloses her own rest. Cost is legible in her frozen tears and collapse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of liberated creativity emerges through image, not statement; final tableau of townspeople waking to art reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Resonance lingers in “stardust, sky, and silence, finally in harmony.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains moonstruck perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under auroral climax, longer cadences in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control and high information density; occasional stacked metaphors (“cathedral of unfinished hymns,” “cosmic midwife”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the lyric mode. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “star-reader liberates dreams” trope is transformed through the aurora-lit archway and the brass instrument’s ghost-lens. Specificity of baker’s birds and librarian’s sonnets grounds the premise in lived detail.</comment>
