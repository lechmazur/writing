<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from erasure to witness-archivist is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (whispering biographies, kneeling in mud, setting the table). Interiority stays specific and embodied; the contradiction between mandate and empathy is active in-scene. The final refusal carries visible social cost (supervisor frown, permanent reassignment). One hairline slip: “humanity remembers” is a touch grandiloquent for a man who has spoken only quietly till now.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces erasure, accepts permanent exile to the town, cost legible in the supervisor’s frown and new title. Causal chain holds: each photograph found tightens his ethical screw until the gazebo self-portrait forces the stance crystallization. Orientation is clean within 120 words. Lens stays situational-pressure throughout. No meaningful breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cracked asphalt, drowned rooftops “like knuckles,” sapphire label in palm—details are selective, sensory, filtered through Elias’s warden gaze. The midnight ridgeway and resurfacing town constrain every choice: where he sets the table, where locals stand, where the state arrives. Micro-setting (label, gazebo mud) charges the final image. No white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“contain sentiment vs honor memory”—tightens once, decisively, at the gazebo photo. Pressure is coherent under situational lens: each artifact surfaces more ethical weight until silence after the chime becomes the space where truth must speak. Cost is visible: career path redirected, myth left alive. No escalation after that single turn, hence not quite 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: public memory as civic resistance. Subtext lives in gesture—laying photographs beside rusted tricycle, locals’ mirrored hush. Final image of state officials silently yielding reweights power without moralizing. No echo-statements; the sapphire toast reprises with new, quieter meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature vivid in “metallic sigh swallowed by humid air,” “toasted his wife’s portrait every night.” Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences for surfacing town, clipped beats for bureaucrats. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Voice feels singular and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, varied; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“precisely humane,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by bureaucratic POV. One tiny scaffold: “He stood…he carried…he began” triplet could be varied, but it occurs early and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Flooded town resurfacing as memory reclamation is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile relics rather than abstract elegy. Sapphire label, photographs, and bureaucratic mandate synthesize into a singular stance. Risk—quiet refusal instead of rebellion—pays off. Could edge higher if one relic carried an even sharper twist, but already publishable-tier original.</comment>
