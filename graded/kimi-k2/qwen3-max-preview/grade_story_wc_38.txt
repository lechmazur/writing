<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is embodied in her precise, spider-like motions and the tactile memory of her mother’s lullaby; her choice to remain and encrypt the core instead of boarding the submersible crystallizes her arc with visible cost—self-erasure. Motivation is consistently rooted in “encrypt vulnerability as strength,” and every micro-choice (heel strike, wrist flick, dice roll) flows from that trait. The final renunciation lands as Earned Stasis, foreclosing escape for a larger liberation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira’s final dance rewrites the lab’s algorithm and herself, costing her physical presence. Causal chain holds—dice glyphs learned from mother → reroute vents → awaken subs → choose encryption over escape. Orientation is immediate; the trench, algae glow, and flooded corridors anchor by line 3. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early (journal stanzas, dance-as-protocol) culminates in the harmonic collapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is not backdrop; its coolant vents, biometric locks, and reactor chamber constrain every tactic. Phosphorescent algae and silt-choked glass filter perception, narrowing to the red cipher eye at climax. Spatial choreography is exact—distances from console to bay, drone blind spots at 37°C. Environment charges the final image: water surges as veil, not destroyer, reweighting collapse as encryption.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation through encryption—tightens when each dance step narrows options: reroute vents mislead drones, dice purge cores, final dance collapses the frame. Escalation is driven by Elira’s agency under Accumulative lens; each journal stanza and pirouette increases density until the harmonic implosion. Cost is legible: she forfeits her body to become code.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: encryption as resistance, fragility weaponized. The motif of “dance as cipher” deepens from lullaby waltz to final encryption ritual, reweighted at closure. No moralizing; the capsule’s mirrored notation invites readers to decode freedom in rhythm. Subtext resides in silence—Elira never declares intent, only moves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, echoing Elira’s spider-like deliberation: “slow certainty of a spider spinning its web.” Syntax coils and releases like tides; diction stays within her perceptual lexicon (glyphs, vents, sonar). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression taught early—“static hymns,” “salt-resistant ink”—pays off in the mirrored dance notation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function (“corroded consoles whispering in static hymns”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (web, tide, cipher). Rhythm accelerates with coolant hiss and dice glow, then hushes for the final encryption. Line-level control supports closure without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—underwater lab, dance-as-code, hangman’s dice repurposed for liberation—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (dystopian lab, resistance) are transformed through embodied choreography and harmonic collapse. Specificity of lullaby-waltz morse code and mirrored notation creates freshness. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
