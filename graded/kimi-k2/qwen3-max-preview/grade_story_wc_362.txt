<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mystic’s interiority is precise—her fingers “tracing the glass prism’s edges as if reading braille” shows embodied motive. Her refusal to publish crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost (silence as forfeiture). The only drag is a brief diagnostic echo—“emotion is mass”—but it’s offset by prior embodied proof.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frost’s melt reframes the entire premise—objects release what they hold. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory beat tightens the pattern until the final droplets reweight meaning. Cost is legible in the prism’s warmth and her silent vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost on glass are not backdrop but instruments: the prism’s apex aligns with ice-fern to unlock stored memory. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneeling, pressing, sketching—each move tethered to setting. Final image of droplets tracing paths charges the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving emotion lingers in objects—escalates through each refracted memory until the driver’s surrender reconfigures the mystic’s goal from proof to witness. One decisive tightening: she lowers the prism and chooses silence. Cost is the forfeiture of public validation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: “objects do not forget” is demonstrated, not declared. The frost’s melt offers a resonant, non-moral answer—release, not redemption. Subtext hums in the prism’s warmth and the unspoken contract between observer and observed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, each metaphor earned—“mist curling like breath,” “diary, its confession.” Syntax mirrors the mystic’s attentive stillness; no head-hop or register drift. Final cadence—“Let others shatter their assumptions against her silence”— crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“veins of white spreading like capillaries”—never muddled. Rhythm breathes with revelation, accelerating only at the moment of release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise reframes grief as stored data in glass and frost—fresh, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. The “truthful lie” conceit risks gimmick yet pays off through embodied ritual. Specificity of quartz arbor and abandoned car roots the concept in irreplaceable detail.</comment>
