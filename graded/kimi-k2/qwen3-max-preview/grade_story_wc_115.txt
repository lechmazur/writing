<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is sharp and embodied (“drowsy alertness,” “static after sleep”), motives track cleanly from skepticism to self-confrontation. The swallowed-truth motif is dramatized through micro-choices—touching the valve, pocketing the radio—rather than told. A credible Earned Stasis closes the arc: she leaves the valve, accepts the cost. Minor slip: the father-confession backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that edges the 20 % ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift is redefined as psychological machinery, and the cost is the un-erased weight of guilt. Causal chain is tight—radio call → tunnel → valve twist → realization. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“mouth of the forgotten train tunnel”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern holds to the final dust-fall image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through POV priorities—rust, mildew, gravel under boots—each detail pressures action (the valve half-buried in collapsed tiles). The tunnel’s spatial logic is coherent; flashlight beam slices usable darkness. The valve and radio serve as micro-setting objects that constrain the final choice. A hairline slip: the mill itself is off-stage, so textile machinery is heard only as metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I unload this truth?”—tightens when the radio replays her own confession. One decisive turn: twisting the valve redefines the haunting as internal, foreclosing magical absolution. Cost is visible—she pockets the corroded radio, not the valve, accepting permanent cargo. Pressure escalates via accumulating sensory density rather than external threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of the ghost-shift trope: guilt is the unpaid overtime of memory. Subtext is carried by objects (valve, radio) rather than exposition. Final image—“dust falling like silent applause”—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; the confession-to-echo arc stays coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually specific (“beads along its rim dulled by decades of grime”) and rhythmically controlled under stress. Compression (“not ghosts, but recorded voices”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. A single register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in the closing paragraph—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“looms clattering like chattering teeth”) and causally tied. One mixed image—“static after sleep”—is minor. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional crests. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost-shift premise is inverted into psychological machinery rather than literal haunting, a fresh synthesis. Specific lived detail (brass valve etched with 3-7) grounds the trope. Risk-taking in structure—radio playback of her own call—pays off causally. No derivative echoes; the father-confession thread feels particular to this voice.</comment>
