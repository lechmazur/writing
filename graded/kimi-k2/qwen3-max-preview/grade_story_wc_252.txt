<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied contradictions (grace vs callouses, skeptic vs listener) are vivid; the scrimshaw’s warmth and dissolution force a visible cost. Interiority is concrete, though the final shift to “mend souls” edges toward summary. Motivation arc is earned under Accumulative lens. One slip: “tenderness sharpened by the combative edge” is label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the island’s rise and scrimshaw’s dissolution crystallize Lira’s new vocation with felt cost. Pattern is taught early (kelp shimmer, whale hum) and tightens through lyrical escalation. No causality breaks; transitions are legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Lira’s dock-tuned senses; bioluminescent kelp and tide-worn crates constrain movement and mood. Micro-setting (whalebone ridges biting palm) charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—detaching from a life “too small”—is signaled early and tightens through the whale’s call and island’s surfacing. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer deepens the cost of staying the same. Agency is crystallized in the final stance. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: freedom through alignment, not escape. Subtext operates in gesture (kissing the child’s forehead) and silence. Final image of “wounded wave” reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is preserved; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in dock-worker idiom; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“whispered truces”) and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“lover’s reproach”) are precise and character-bound. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is academic, but it lands outside the POV’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime myth and post-war healing; disappearing-island-as-memory is non-obvious yet inevitable. Tropes are transformed through Lira’s specific laboring body. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative arc) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes.</comment>
