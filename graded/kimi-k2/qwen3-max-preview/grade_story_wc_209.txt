<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers tracing brittle edges,” “stained with pigment and pollen”), motives clear, and the final renunciation of explanation carries felt cost. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“gnawing need to reckon”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the artist lays her own postcard on the altar, completing a cycle and surrendering to the mystery. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of discovery and re-presentation tightens to a charged poise. Cost is legible in the “lighter satchel, heavier heart.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cathedral glass and amber pavilion are rendered with tactile specificity; the etched blooms literally constrain her choices as she traces them. Micro-setting (lens, postcard edges) doubles as setting and tool. No orientation debt; every detail is filtered through her biased attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding the nocturnal miracle—tightens through each discovered bloom, narrowing to the final surrender. Agency is attention and renunciation; the cost is the refusal to explain, foreclosing fame. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of tracing hidden flowers; the final image reweights the premise—beauty persists in obscurity—without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence and pigment-stained fingers. Resonant, non-literal answer delivered in the closing hymn of petals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“icicles weeping… reluctant farewells”). Perceptual signature is painterly—color, texture, negative space. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off in the final “umbral tenderness.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One minor loop (“brittle and gold… brittle edges”) but does not obscure clarity. No artifacts in peak beats; final cadence is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope is transformed through the specific lens of nocturnal botany and cathedral glass. The synthesis of postcard, moonflower, and painted mural feels inevitable. Risk lies in quiet surrender rather than revelation, and it lands.</comment>
