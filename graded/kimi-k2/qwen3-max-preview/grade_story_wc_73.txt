<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the die-click heartbeat and the tactile memory of the arcade ground the grim optimist’s regret. Motivation is consistent: every micro-choice (carving proofs, rolling the die, touching the reflection) is driven by the need to “capture the texture” of the missed throw. The final renunciation—climbing on without the die—earns its cost because the staircase has already digested his proofs and the reflection has re-priced the regret. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted more than dramatized in the moment-to-moment climbs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the staircase’s liquid-glass ripple crystallizes the missed throw into usable texture, and the die’s vanishing marks the paid cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each proof, echo, and roll thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early by the recursive ascent; no causality breaks. One tightening beat at 37-step landings suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The staircase is not backdrop but antagonist: it absorbs proofs, keeps moving while he sits, and finally liquefies to reveal the unlived moment. Micro-setting (die in pocket, stone under thumbnail) constrains tactics—he carves with his nail because no tool is allowed. Sensory selection narrows to echo, chill, and the velvet-metallic texture of regret. The final reflection-charged image would collapse if the staircase were generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the texture of what might have been”—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each failed proof and rolled die. The 37-step landings provide rhythmic tightening; the liquid-glass moment forces a stance crystallization: continue without the relic. Cost is visible: the die disappears, the past is metabolized, and the climb becomes the only remaining path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive machinery: regret is not erased but transmuted into propulsion. The staircase’s digestion of proofs literalizes the conversion of intellect into motion; the die’s absence in the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—rolling a die that can no longer total seven—and in the silence after the shudder. The ending’s conceptual repricing (“not to mourn it, but to weave it”) is earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is grim, lyric, and mathematically precise: “each footfall a theorem tested against gravity’s silent dissent.” Syntax stretches and compresses with altitude; fragments (“He laughed then—not joy, not despair…”) mirror breath on the climb. No head-hopping; the single POV is rock-steady. Compression (“brushed dust from his trousers that wasn’t there”) teaches the reader to trust elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers image, concept, and motion. Metaphors are controlled (“metronome of regret”) and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; even the repeated “balancedly daring” is recontextualized each time. Minor tic: “geometry wrapped in illusion” edges purple but is earned by prior mathematical scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The perpetual staircase as regret-engine is a fresh synthesis of Sisyphus and Gödel; the chipped die as compass of absence is specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking—recursive ascent without exit—pays off in the liquid-glass rupture that reconfigures meaning. No derivative templates; the emotional calculus is singular. The final image would fail if any element were swapped.</comment>
