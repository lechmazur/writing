<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and embodied; the architect’s calm, pattern-obsessed stance remains coherent under rising pressure. Her micro-choices—thread tension, step over a nonexistent threshold, release of the thread—are visible and costly. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; all conflict is rendered as serene certainty, so the “internal contradiction” criterion is only weakly met. Still, the final renunciation (letting the thread go) is causally earned and forecloses further mapping, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gallery’s eruption is reversed by the thread’s self-weaving, reconfiguring space and meaning while the architect stands older, quieter. Cost is legible in the single line “eyes gleaming with something between sorrow and satisfaction.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each stitched memory increases ambient density until the fabric tears and is re-sewn. Orientation is deliberately delayed but taught by the second paragraph and paid off at the rupture, so the waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gallery is not backdrop but active antagonist: stairs dissolve into ceilings, portraits weep pigment that becomes navigable river. The sinew thread operates as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining every tactical decision. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices fold angles, pulse-temperature of thread, not tourist décor. Final image reuses the “bruised purple sky” first seen in the peeled painting, recharging earlier material.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens via each stitched memory. Escalation is textural: mirrors spawn hostile doubles, ceiling splits, thread thickens; each intensification raises the cost of continuing. No reversible escape hatch remains once she releases the thread. The price (loss of youthful self, irreversible gallery transformation) is visible in the closing mirror image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating metaphor of stitching memory into space; no character ever names “grief” or “healing.” The final corridor paved with “half-remembered birthdays and unsent letters” offers a non-literal answer: connection is the fabric we keep re-sewing after every rupture. Ambiguity persists—did she master the gallery or merely survive it—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete. No moralizing sentence intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is fevered yet precise: “walls rippled like muscle,” “rational enchantment,” “realistically imaginary.” Syntax mirrors architect’s mind—long accumulative clauses, then abrupt fragment (“This was no metaphor.”). Perceptual signature is consistent: she measures angles, temperatures, pattern periodicities. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; compression under stress (“Still, she did not hurry.”) is intentional and taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are deliberate (“marble cracked into lace”) and stay within gallery logic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breathless sentences pre-eruption, then single-line staccato at release. One minor scaffold: “She believed in rational enchantment—…” could be trimmed without loss, preventing a perfect 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses surrealist gallery with fiber-art metaphysics; not a trope mash-up but a singular vision. The “realistically imaginary” rule is established early and obeyed without late cheats. Risk—letting the environment literally unravel—pays off in a reparative image that feels inevitable. Specific detail (bruised-purple sky, Möbius love) prevents abstraction; removal would collapse the story.</comment>
