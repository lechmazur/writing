<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Molt’s shift from sardonic armor to seed-planting gardener is dramatized through concrete beats: the nail-pinning of Elias’s poem, the candle, the whispered flower names. Interior contradiction is shown, not told, when “the old skin of cynicism peel[s] away” as she kneels in dust. The cost—loss of Elias and of her own protective detachment—is legible and scaled to the word count. Only minor deduction for the off-stage friendship origin that supplies the emotional pivot without on-page micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poem pinned, seeds planted, and voice lifted in lullaby crystallize a new stance whose cost is the abandonment of her former “molted” detachment. Accumulative lens holds: each image (tin, candle, seeds) layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake from survival to sowing. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the transfer of Elias is recounted, not witnessed, so the causal trigger is second-hand, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted library, starlight through shattered skylight, candle wax pooling on a torn poem—each detail is filtered through Molt’s vagrant gaze and constrains her final act of planting seeds in floorboard cracks. The coffee tin serves as micro-setting that hides and reveals, its false bottom a tactile hinge in two beats. Weather (wind that does not snuff the candle) and spatial ribs of roof remain coherent. Slight over-supply of adjectives (“cold, luminous fracture”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—tightens when the smuggled poem replaces coins in the tin, forcing her from passive carrier to active planter. One meaningful deepening: candle lit beneath the poem turns remembrance into endangerment, seeds pressed into dust turn memory into future risk. Cost is visible (arrest risk, emotional exposure). Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; no reversal, but the final lullaby crystallizes stance. Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges through image chain: prison-library marginalia, contraband poem, seeds in ruin—never sermonized. Final lullaby about dammed rivers reweights “broken = seeds” without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: will seeds survive? Complexity preserved. One soft echo of Elias’s aphorism near the end slightly over-articulates the thesis, holding it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Molt’s perceptual quirks—ink-stained fingers, thumbnail prying tin, selective attention to gutter rust and candle drip. Sardonic shell versus lullaby singer registers as rhythmic shift: clipped noir cadence melts into elongated lyric vowels. No head-hop; Elias’s voice arrives only via quoted artifact. Compression (“silvered the library’s corroded gutters”) is taught early and paid off in final “luminous fracture.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “wax pooled like liquid starlight” does double sensory work. Rhythm modulates from staccato shards (“boots crunching over broken glass”) to the legato lullaby without drumbeat monotony. One mixed metaphor—“open ribs of the ruined roof” beside “cathedral” of decay—barely blurs physical logic. No loops, no scaffold, strong paragraph cut-test pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of vagrant-poet seed-bomber with prison-library resistance feels fresh; the coffee-tin reliquary and personality-molt are specific inventions, not stock tropes. Risky lyric escalation (singing in ruin) pays off by recharging earlier “burn a mind” line. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, confirming uniqueness. Slight proximity to eco-poetry trend keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
