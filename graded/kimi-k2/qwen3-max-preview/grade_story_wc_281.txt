<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s embodied interiority is precise and character-specific; the somatic mapping of tremors and pulse spikes grounds her arc. The final choice—to open the studio and invite others—carries visible cost (loss of solitude, risk of exposure) and is earned by the preceding bodily trial. Minor slack: Mateo’s voice is heard but not fully dramatized as external pressure, so relationship crucible is partial.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the studio flares into a starfield of shared memory, crystallizing a new communal path. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each somatic cue tightens the pattern until the final frequency is tuned. Cost is legible: she trades isolation for vulnerability. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The light painting studio is rendered through indigo LEDs, resin-flecked floor, blackout velvet—details filtered by Elira’s sensory priorities. The muscovite geode functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when it warms and pulses in sync with her heartbeat. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. One missed beat: turpentine scent is vivid but not re-integrated at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding a non-chemical path to communion—is signaled early and deepens through each somatic marker. One meaningful tightening: the geode’s pulse aligns with her heartbeat, foreclosing the option of passive reception and forcing active transmission. Cost is felt: she must relinquish private grief to become a bridge. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: artificial telepathy was a prosthesis; true connection is fractal, somatic, and costly. The muscovite’s inner architecture mirrors neural pathways without overt statement. Final image—painting glyphs for “fractured minds”—reweights prior material, offering a non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about the ethics of shared memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and anchored in Elira’s perceptual bias: “fractally precise layers,” “willowglass hope.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during somatic spikes. No head-hopping; POV is stable. Occasional elevated diction (“somatic markers”) is justified by her scientific background.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are coherent—geode as “frozen lightning,” studio as “cathedral tuned to frequencies.” No loops or scaffold. One micro-slip: “willowglass hope” is lovely but used twice without reweighting; minor redundancy.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of neuro-tech fallout, somatic cartography, and light-painting feels fresh and inevitable. The telepathy-pill recall is transformed from dystopian trope into a meditation on embodied knowledge. Risk-taking—using bodily tremors as narrative compass—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “muscovite geode” anchors universals.</comment>
