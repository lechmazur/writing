<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, suspended tears—yet her contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are shown more than enacted; the reunion beat lands with earned cost, but the father’s sudden appearance feels slightly under-motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the doorway forms, she steps through, and the whale’s bones glow—cost is the irreversible crossing. Causal chain from coffee spiral → whale skeleton → doorway holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The salt chamber’s gravity pockets and crystal chandeliers constrain every move; the pressed aster’s final glow charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory hierarchy mirrors Elira’s scientific gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find deleted memories”—tightens when the coffee grounds form the whale skeleton, forcing the crossing. One meaningful deepening; cost is the irreversible exit from normal gravity/time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as displaced gravity emerges through concrete pattern work; the final image of suspended jellyfish-memories reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the aster’s silver pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“salt crystals chimed as she crossed the threshold”—with a perceptual signature tuned to weight and absence. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into the crossing beat. Minor over-modulation in “gleaming silence” phrase, but it serves tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of marine gothic and memory physics; the whale-cathedral and gravity pockets feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
