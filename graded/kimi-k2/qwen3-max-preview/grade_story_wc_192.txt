<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The keeper’s contradictory impulses—yearning to heal yet refusing contact—pulse in every beat; the final renunciation (“stop fighting the shape of your own throat”) is earned by the scar-threading ritual and costs her the sanctuary itself. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the mission’s external stakes remain abstract; the cost is felt but not clearly scaled to anyone beyond the self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each image layers density until the threshold’s surrender reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the sanctuary folds, the doorknocker falls, breath is re-priced. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight”) and anchors hold. Closure lands in the lantern-field image that reweights every prior severance. No causal break or loop touches the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s charcoal dust, starlight pool, and the doorknocker’s cold curve are returned in tactile handling that constrains each micro-choice; the threshold literally dissolves, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to skin-level chill and taste of burnt sugar under crisis. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Just shy of 9 because the broader world beyond the lantern-field remains un-etched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she teach suffocation to breathe without re-entering old dependence—tightens when the threshold groans recognition and she presses palm instead of knocking, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates via accretion of echo-shapes, not causal reversals, fitting the lyric mode. Cost is legible: sanctuary folds, doorknocker released. A hair more external jeopardy would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the scar-threaded curriculum: healing is not rescue but permission to “fumble in the dark.” The final non-literal reweighting—“suffocation ends… when you stop fighting the shape of your own throat”—resonates without moralizing. No symbolic object is harvested late; every echo is earned. Ambiguity lingers yet feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to the keeper’s perceptual filter—cold metal, ash taste, starlight on collarbone—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calm, fragments under pulse, mirroring breath control. Patterned repetition (“She burns bridges carefully”) is taught early and pays off in the lantern-field release. No register drift or filter-verb clutter in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—threshold as ink in rain, smoke that never blinds—without mixed-metaphor muddle. High density: each line advances image or stakes. One minor scaffold (“she returned not to beg, but to offer”) could be trimmed, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The scar-as-thread mechanism literalizes emotional suture in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; the dissolving threshold re-prices sanctuary itself. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without obscuring clarity. Slight echo of “bridge-burning” trope is transmuted through measured silence and lantern-field payoff. Not quite 9+ only because the core metaphor of teaching lungs memory is faintly familiar.</comment>
