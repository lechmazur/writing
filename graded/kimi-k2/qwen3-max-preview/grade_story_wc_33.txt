<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and particular; the mailman’s contradictory impulses—stoic obedience vs clandestine mercy—surface in micro-choices (bowing to guards while hiding the storm). The final renunciation (handing over the bottle) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary pressure from Marla is brief but functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore to the next, culminating in a Charged Poise as the drone lifts. Closure reconfigures meaning—storm becomes signal, not weapon—at undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade’s ozone-and-sugar air and flickering neon constrain tactics (storm interference rig) and charge the final image. Micro-setting (bottle against ribs) functions as setting-as-tool. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver mercy across a lethal border—tightens once when drone interceptors are reported, forcing reroute through ventilation shafts. Cost is visible: relinquishing the storm, accepting heightened risk. Agency drives escalation under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: promises broken and mended by subversive compassion. Final image of thunder that “doesn’t frighten her” reweights the storm from threat to lullaby without moralizing. Subtext in silence and coded coordinates deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet grounded: “rusted trike… skipped heartbeat” sets cadence; compression taught early. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Dialogue between Marla and mailman carries subtext in nervous pinball taps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical. Figurative language is purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm accelerates with drone lift, then exhales in final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weather-as-smuggler, arcade-as-bunker, grief-as-cargo. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (bottled storm) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “ozone and burnt sugar” anchors universals.</comment>
