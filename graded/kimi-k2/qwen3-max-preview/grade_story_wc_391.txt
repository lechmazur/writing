<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapper’s interiority is embodied in lunar-synced breath and chalk-on-iron gestures; her renunciation of spectacle for stillness is earned through tactile ritual. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—only serene resolve—so the arc edges toward monolith. Still, the final kneel carries visible cost: she surrenders the right to claim victory aloud.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the regime’s envoys retreat into silence, reconfiguring power without a shot fired. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each moon-tracked line of chalk thickens the pattern until silence itself becomes the decisive act. Cost is legible in the mapper’s self-erasure: “she did not celebrate.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt, hoarfrost, and rusted iron are filtered through her lunar-tuned attention; the viaduct’s lattice constrains every chalk stroke. Weather and stone guide choice—ice thickness dictates timing, magnetic rails dictate alignment. Final image: palm on iron, moon overhead—environment charges the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—replace conquest with stillness—tightens as each chalk line forecloses the old industrial song. One deepening: soldiers arrive, are disarmed by wonder, retreat. Agency is attention itself; cost is the mapper’s anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: revolution as frost-spread silence, not fire. Subtext in the envoys’ confusion—power unseated by incomprehension. Final whispered thanks to the moon offers non-literal answer: stillness as radical act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, tidal, lunar—syntax mirrors the hush it seeks. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective magnetism and chalk dust. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer breaths during mapping, clipped fragments when soldiers approach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—“unyoked the viaduct’s magnetic song” fuses action and metaphor. Metaphors stay coherent: frost, iron, moonlight. No register drift; diction remains within the mapper’s quiet lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent revolution via lunar cartography—is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Risk: no violence, no manifesto, yet stakes feel world-sized. Transformation test: story collapses if viaduct or moon is swapped.</comment>
