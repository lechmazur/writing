<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The operator’s interiority is rich—grief borrowed, empathy eroded, motives gnawing—but her decisive act (final glyph, fragment relinquished) is slightly under-motivated by the prior causal chain; the cost is felt yet not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glyph’s triple meaning reconfigures reader stance while the fragment’s dimming signals spent empathy; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, pattern taught early, final image reweights all prior pamphlets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Topaz workshop and halo fragment act as micro-setting; the fragment’s glow constrains every emotional equation and charges the final dimming. Spatial anchors clear, sensory detail selective, star-vault collapse tightens the clock.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping emotion’s unmappable math—tightens as each borrowed personality exacts a toll; the final glyph crystallizes the cost of empathy without boundaries, foreclosing further use of the fragment.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as non-Euclidean space emerges from concrete acts: pamphlets, borrowed grief, fragment-induced weeping. Final glyph offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; ambiguity is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, shifting syntax to mirror borrowed personalities; perceptual signature distinct—ink, brass, starlight refracted into glyphs. No head-hopping; compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language patterned, never muddled. No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers information. Final image—“a single glyph that meant ‘beginning,’ ‘ending,’ and ‘bridge’”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—empathy as dimensional shard, mathematics of grief—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (mystical object, cryptic artisan) transformed through specificity; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
