<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—precision vs surrender—are dramatized in the tactile choices (nickel, tuning fork, palm press) and culminate in the earned renunciation of her restorer identity; the cost is felt in the final river-stone heartbeat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural’s disappearance and the stone’s arrival mark an irreversible shift from fixer to vessel. Causal chain (nickel → reflected sound → awakening) holds without gaps; cost is legible in the vanished mural and altered body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden’s resonant architecture (brass petals, echo arches) actively constrains Elira’s method and charges the final image; every sensory detail is filtered through her professional ear and later through her transformed body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for wonder—tightens once when the nickel’s reflection forces surrender; pressure escalates via sonic layers peeling back memory and identity. Cost is visible in the loss of the mural and the hobo nickel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: restoration as self-dissolution. The final stone in B-flat reweights the entire premise—knowledge is not preserved but transmuted—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, sensorially precise voice remains stable; perceptual signature (decibel decay, harmonic resin) is consistent. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the spiral chime.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (ultrasonic blue, subsonic crimson) serve the sonic logic. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the pressure waves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic frescoes as psychic archaeology. The garden’s architecture and the nickel’s transformation feel inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking (conceptual sound-as-substance) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
