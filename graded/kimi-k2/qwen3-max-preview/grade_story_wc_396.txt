<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“shadow-laced,” “boots crunching brittle frost”), contradictions between duty and fragility are dramatized in real time, and the final choice to carry the humming fragment is earned by the preceding beats of resonance and cost. No headcount or relationship pressure to test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s self-reflection crystallizes the shift from enforcing silence to offering witness. Causal linkage holds—each mirror glimpse tightens the internal stake until the final question “What if we choose differently?” lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Orchard, lighthouse beam, ice floes, and mirrors are filtered through the POV’s selective attention; the oldest mirror constrains the final choice by forcing self-confrontation. Spatial choreography is clean, and weather/terrain pressure choices without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reconstituting courage via empathy—is signaled early and escalates through each mirror encounter; the final tightening is the self-glimpse that forecloses the option of remaining an external peacekeeper. Cost is the surrender of anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of pressing the fragment to mirrors; no abstract sermonizing. The final whispered question reframes the entire orchard sequence as a quiet manifesto for mercy over vengeance, resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“calmly intuitive,” “weighted breath”). No dialogue, but the internal monologue carries subtext and rhythmic variation that matches emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are precise (“scar-map of lost futures”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated and never muddles clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—using scavenged mirrors and a broken crystal to reconstitute post-war empathy—is fresh, specific, and fully committed. The risk of quiet lyricism pays off in the final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
