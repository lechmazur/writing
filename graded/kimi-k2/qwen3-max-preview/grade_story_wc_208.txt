<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “scaffold complexity with simplicity” is dramatized through her carving choices under storm pressure; her interiority is salted with sensory specificity and micro-choices that reconfigure her stance. The final renunciation—leaving the sculpture to become communal—earns its cost by the prior accumulation of tactile labor and ancestral trust. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is vivid and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the projected shadow bridge crystallizes a new communal path while foreclosing Elara’s solitary-artist trajectory. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each salvaged plank and lantern pass tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within the single-scene default.</comment>

<comment>Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but active constraint—wind “turbine-hum” vibrates molars, rain needles scalp, dictating carving tempo. Driftwood plank and lantern slide function as micro-settings that literally shape the final projection. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static postcarding.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—turn solitary art into shared shelter—tightens when storm and ancestral slide pressure Elara to relinquish ownership. One meaningful deepening: carving negative-space hands shifts her from hoarding beauty to gifting it. Cost is the forfeiture of personal acclaim, legible in the leaving.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of alliance-as-survival emerges through concrete gestures, not statement; final projection reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext hums in the unspoken contract between Viking, monk, sailor, child—echoed by villagers’ anonymous offerings. Resonance lingers as ambiguity: whose hands are whose?</comment>

<comment>Voice is salt-crusted, rhythmic, tactile—“salt-crusted boots,” “turbine-hum reverie”—distinctive and consistent under pressure. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on lyrical interior monologue that modulates with storm intensity. No POV drift; psychic distance tightens as wind rises.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught (storm = turbine, wood = listener) and paid off in final image. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors carving strokes—cyclical, meditative—without monotony.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: GPS failure + magic lantern slide + driftwood carving = non-obvious meditation on tech vs. touch. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in communal shadow bridge. Specificity of “storm-tossed archway” anchors universals; no template echo.</comment>
