<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her salt-stung knees, the diary’s weight on her sternum—but the final surrender to “living ledger” status feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized in a single micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon’s phosphorescent faces crystallize her new role as witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each debris-message tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and floating zeppelin are not mere backdrop; their tidal pulse and swaying shelves physically constrain tactics and charge the final glow. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, anchoring the witching-hour ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“truth in tension”—is signaled early and escalates through each debris arrangement; the lagoon’s refusal and eventual response force a stance crystallization with visible cost (her sleepless witness).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the parley ritual: history demands embodied listening, not archival extraction. The final non-literal image—“We are not gone. We are waiting”—reweights all prior debris-messages without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (“salt-scarred dunes,” “brine and burnt cedar”) remains consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final luminous tableau.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) is voice-motivated and legible. Metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The encrypted-diary-meets-lagoon séance is a fresh synthesis; the debris-message liturgy transforms a familiar grief-ritual trope into something specific and inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
