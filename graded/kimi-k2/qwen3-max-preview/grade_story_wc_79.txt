<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—“hollow ache lodged beneath her ribs,” “reed whistle tucked against her sternum like a second heart.” Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) coexist in scene. Final resolve to climb the ridge at midnight is earned by seventeen seasons of iterative failure and the watcher’s micro-turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the decision to ascend the ridge at midnight crystallizes stakes—become cartographer of silence or join the lost. Causal chain intact: cracked sequence → watcher’s fractional turn → irrevocable commitment. Cost is the forfeiture of safety and city’s denial. Lens: Causal, held to final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Shell-street grooves, salt-shadow watchers, and the balcony’s scorched plateau are tactile and selective. Micro-setting (reed whistle against sternum) constrains the final choice. Environment guides action: ridge angle dictates climb time; watcher sightlines dictate whistle stance. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—break watchers’ silence or join the vanished—tightens once: watcher’s head-turn converts dread into action. Agency is renunciation of city’s denial; cost is explicit in “she packed her satchel… wouldn’t wait for permission.” Pressure escalates under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-violence emerges from spirals, whistles, and watchers without statement. Final image—her ascent forcing watchers to “choose whether to remain silent—or confess”—reweights premise. Subtext in pattern-language as resistance to erasure. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and compressed: “sun bleached the sky white,” “sound that slipped between buildings like smoke.” Syntax mirrors obsession—long sentences for maps, staccato for stakes. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is cartographer’s (noticing ridges as streets, spirals as questions).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances map, motive, or dread. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “failed lungs” for collapsed spirals. Rhythm accelerates toward the final beat. No scaffolding or register drift. Reed whistle and spirals recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: turtle-shell city, cartographer of silence, pattern-language as insurgent code. Watchers as salt statues reframes colonial gaze. Risk—lyric refusal of dialogue—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: story collapses if setting or whistle removed.</comment>
