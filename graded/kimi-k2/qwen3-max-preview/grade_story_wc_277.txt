<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; the pen nib, telescope, and smoke ritual all externalize a lifelong vocation of “reading margins.” The final micro-choice—emailing the folio—pays off her grandfather’s creed with visible cost (exposure risk). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate isn’t quite cleared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emailed Q.E.D. collapses the official lie and reweights her world. Causal chain (call → scope → documentation → send) is tight; the telescope mod and 2:17 a.m. burn schedule serve as persistent constraints. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass, iron ribs, and repurposed spy optics are lived-in tools, not postcards; they enable the inversion that produces the evidence. City lights smoldering “like embers beneath a blanket of mist” mirrors her regret while supplying the visual proof she needs. Environment directly shapes the final tactic—no scope, no closure—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose erasure—tightens when the rhythmic smoke pattern becomes a countable, timestamped purge she can falsify. One meaningful escalation: she pivots from observation to intervention, forfeiting anonymity. Cost is legible in the email send; persistent constraint is the telescope itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion motif: truth hides in margins, not headlines; orbits return, but paths can still be walked. The final Q.E.D. reweights “orbits of regret” into chosen trajectories without moralizing. Subtext of inherited responsibility is carried solely by the pen nib and ledger quote—no exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains a lyrical, precise diction (“ellipses in official statements”) that feels like her forensic attention. Rhythm swells and contracts with emotional pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Purposeful elision (“She didn’t need them”) teaches the reader to trust pattern recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, metaphor, and causality—without scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined: “smoke… a dark thread stitching sky to earth” charges closure. Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing antique observatory optics with decommissioned spy tech to create an urban microscope is a fresh, specific synthesis. The “proof by contradiction” structural engine repurposes a mathematical method as narrative strategy, transforming a familiar whistleblower arc into something intellectually playful yet urgent.</comment>
