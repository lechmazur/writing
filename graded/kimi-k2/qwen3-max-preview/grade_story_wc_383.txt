<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, specific, and embodied (“dread pooling in her ribs,” “salt-tongued secrets”). The contradiction between skepticism and charmed surrender is active in every beat; the final vow is earned by the prior cataloguing. Micro-choices (kneel, place shell, whisper back) trace a credible shift from witness to sovereign. No other characters on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens until the cadence shift at “I remember you” reweights meaning with undeniable cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—options foreclosed, independence crystallized, shell left as node. Anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the shell’s final silence after harmonic sync makes the cost audible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden, body, shell, and sky are filtered through POV bias; every detail is selective and purposeful. Velvet garden constrains movement (vines curl ankles) and supplies the weeping-willow node that houses the shell—directly shaping the final placement. Micro-setting (shell against temple) functions as the crucible for the archival act. Final image reuses “velvet hush” to charge the exit, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signaled in paragraph 6 and tightened once: the vow converts memory into compass, foreclosing the option to keep carrying the shell. Pressure grows via density of recalled images, each a supernova that collapses into unbearable void; the tightening is felt, not declared. Cost is the shell’s silence and her renunciation of return. Agency is archival attention; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the alchemy of archiving pain into sovereignty; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in the shell’s offer—not pleading but offering—and her vow’s reversal of quarantine logic. Final image of “compass” reweights earlier “lattices of longing” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: independence is fluency, not erasure, leaving fertile counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile and sonic (“petals that sighed,” “salt-tongued secrets”). Syntax mirrors emotional crescendo: longer anaphoric sentences build to the short vow. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Patterned elision (“resonance structures”) is taught early and paid off at climax; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is dense but coherent—vehicles stay within physical logic (supernovas collapse, void afterward). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. No mixed metaphors or therapy-speak in peak beats; final line is clean, propulsive, and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-archiving via seashell resonance—is fresh yet grounded in sensory specificity. Transformation test fails: this exact voice and garden could not be swapped. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without obscuring closure. Synthesis of alchemy, quarantine, and sovereignty feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
