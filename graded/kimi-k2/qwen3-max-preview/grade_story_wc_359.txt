<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; synesthetic gift is shown through action. Motive—"to certify wonder"—is stated, but the final choice to walk away feels slightly under-motivated; no visible internal contradiction at the climax. Still, the character’s sensory lens is consistent and individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc with clear closure: the final chord unfetters wonder, reconfiguring the cavern and the bell ringer’s stance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each chime deepens the auroral pattern and stakes. Cost is felt in the melting amber sheet and the bell ringer’s ragged breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Ice cavern and aurora are not backdrop but active forces: walls bloom, stalactites glow, hush dances. The prism bell and amber sheet function as micro-settings that constrain every strike. Final image—aurora-light tangled in hair—charges the parting beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder”—is signaled early and tightened through each chromatic chime. Agency is exercised in the deliberate strikes; the cavern’s response escalates pressure. Closure shows the cost: the sheet dissolves, the hush is re-sculpted, and the bell ringer leaves forever changed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder as oxygen, not luxury. Subtext lives in synesthetic synapses and auroral glyphs—never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the blizzard beyond.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and controlled; no head-hopping. Rhythmic compression (“breath curling like spectral notation”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final aurora-light. Diction stays within the bell ringer’s perceptual lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances color, texture, or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid sapphire, topaz tremors, molten amethyst”) risk purple, but the pattern is taught and purposeful under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic auroral bell-ringing feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of silence into sculpted hush is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
