<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“curse that showed him seconds before they happened”), but the grandmother’s promise is delivered as exposition rather than dramatized memory; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curse flips from burden to method, crystallized in the final rock placement and eel mandala; causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds, cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frictionless world and aurora are not mere backdrop; they actively constrain action (no grip, no speech) and charge the final image when the eels dissolve into light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming curse into wonder—tightens through each placement of painted stones; agency is visible, cost is the surrender of predictive certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern vs. control; the final image reframes the grandmother’s promise as method, not answer, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“salt fog,” “collapsed star dust”) remains consistent; no head-hopping, compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid mercury on the rocks”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frictionless physics, precognitive herding, and sacred geometry synthesize into a fresh mythic lens; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
