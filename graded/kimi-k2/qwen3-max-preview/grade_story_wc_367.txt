<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The herald’s interiority is lyrically vivid—her laughter as “wind chimes forged from lightning” embodies her paradoxical nature—but her choices remain largely atmospheric rather than tactical. The single decisive micro-choice (blowing the kiss that steers possibility) is under-motivated by prior interior contradiction, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the lantern’s inverted shadow reconfigures the world’s dreaming edge, and the cost is the herald’s perpetual vigil (“three hours of sleep”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly ritual deepens the pattern—though the causal linkage between her laughter and the fisherman’s silver catch is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, salt-slick cliffs, and lantern wick are rendered with tactile specificity; the tower’s meteorite spiral and storm-feather nest constrain movement and anchor ritual. The final image of her “luminous shadow” across the crown re-weights the setting as invitation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reshaping human longing from weariness to wonder—escalates through the lantern’s flare and the glimpse of coral libraries. The tightening is poetic rather than tactical; the cost (her sleepless eternity) is felt but not dramatized as an immediate trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light must “dance with dark to be born.” The inverted shadow as illumination re-prices the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the fisherman’s wordless awe deepens resonance, though the children’s future remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is incantatory, compressed, and consistent: “laughter ringing like wind chimes forged from lightning” teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is storm-borne and salt-stung. Syntax mirrors ritual cadence; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors cohere within storm/light lexicon. Minor loop in “laugh again… climb again” is ritualistic, not redundant. No figurative muddle at climax; final kiss to horizon crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of meteorite lighthouse, neural-stream obsolescence, and inverted-shadow prophecy feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes. The “ancient shadows” motif is transformed through embodied ritual rather than trope.</comment>
