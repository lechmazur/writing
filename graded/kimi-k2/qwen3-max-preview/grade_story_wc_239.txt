<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and specific—e.g., “she absorbed them without judgment”—but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible. Motivation (clarity over salvation) is consistent and intensifies toward surrender. The final renunciation is earned, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the witness becomes “the hush after,” a crystallized Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dissolution and re-coherence tightens once. Orientation is deliberately disorienting but taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Library’s spiral shelves and “domeless sky” anchor space while constraining movement toward the heart. The dictionary’s physical decay and the regret-bound volume act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—e.g., “dust motes hung like frozen stars.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unifying reality through spiral arbitration—is signaled early and tightens once when the dictionary dissolves into light. Agency is renunciation rather than action; the cost is conceptual but legible. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-as-negotiation emerges from concrete dissolution of language, not assertion. Final image of “the hush after” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture—e.g., “she smiled, not with joy, but with recognition.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; patterned elision (“universe’s hiccup”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is distinct—e.g., “books shelved…by resonance.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Syntax mirrors the spiral motion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are precise—“dust motes hung like frozen stars.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating toward dissolution. Occasional elevated diction fits the cosmic register without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of a timeless library where books hum by resonance feels fresh. Spiral arbitration as method older than language is a non-obvious synthesis. Final transformation into “the hush after” is inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (negative-space flicker) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
