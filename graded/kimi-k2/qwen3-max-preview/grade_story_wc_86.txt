<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the drawer pull anchors memory and choice. The negotiator’s “uncommonly thoughtful” trait manifests in micro-listening beats that tilt the final stance. Cost is felt when she trades relics and ghosts. Minor slack: the brother’s fate is backstory rather than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: invitation → meeting → relic exchange → shared path. Closure is a Charged Poise: options reconfigured without tidy resolution, cost legible in the swapped talismans. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-battered parapet and mist are not postcard backdrop; exposure enforces vulnerability as currency. The drawer pull and key act as micro-settings that constrain the final exchange. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Weather pressure is causally active, not decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can two former adversaries trade ghosts instead of prisoners—tightens once when relics change hands. Agency is negotiator’s choice to proceed without guarantees; cost is the relinquished talisman and the unspoken names. No coincidence resolves the tension; pressure remains coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of recycled loss emerges from the drawer pull’s journey and the unspoken list of names. Subtext operates in the silence after “swapping ghosts.” Final image of two silhouettes walking into unmarked path reweights premise without moralizing. Wisdom is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to negotiator; perceptual signature is selective, weather-filtered. Dialogue is spare, subtext-laden, and rhythmically distinct from narrative texture. No head-hopping or register drift. Compression in final paragraph is taught by earlier cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is precise—“mist curled like smoke” is earned, not ornamental. Final line lands with quiet propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prisoner-exchange trope is inverted into a ritual of ghost-swapping; relic exchange feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of Justice-Ministry drawer pull and cell key grounds the concept. Risk is taken in the quiet, anti-dramatic closure that trusts resonance over spectacle.</comment>
