<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vey’s shift from bureaucrat to curator of echoes is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing glyphs, pressing urn fragments—so the renunciation of “counting seconds” carries felt cost. Interior contradiction pulses when their heart restarts only after the urn’s chime, making the final stance earned. Lira’s presence is brief but sufficient to refract Vey’s grief and curiosity, turning the silo into a crucible of shared memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each relic adds sensory density until the urn’s fusion delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—time as accumulated dust, not passing river. Closure lands on the page with the low chime that restarts Vey’s heart, a visible cost paid in timeless stillness. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s refracted glow and humming walls function as micro-setting that constrains choice: only here can the urn fragments fuse. Sensory selection is urgent—mother-of-pearl flecks, scent of rain—filtered through Vey’s texture-seeking gaze. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the texture of time—tightens as each relic adds sensory weight, culminating in the urn’s chime that forecloses Vey’s old metric of seconds. Agency is exercised in the deliberate act of curation, costing the safety of timelessness. Pressure grows under the Accumulative lens without external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the urn’s whisper: time accumulates, not elapses. The final image—Vey writing new listings to summon echoes—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the urn’s warmth and the silo’s hum, never stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Vey’s breathless timelessness: “still hums with the ghost of breakfasts unmade.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Vey notices textures, not ticks. No head-hopping; Lira’s few lines carry distinct grief-sharpened diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing texture or choice. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined to the texture motif. The final chime lands clean, no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic timekeeper turned sensory curator feels inevitable and fresh. The urn-as-echo rather than ash, the capsule as adaptive archive—these transform familiar tropes through specific, grounded detail. Risk in lyric compression pays off.</comment>
