<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlen’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—his fingertip tracing chalk, murmuring dead dialects, micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is specific and textured; no stock phrasing. The final hopscotch-cipher mastery is earned by prior pattern study and carries visible cost: he forfeits anonymity and orphan safety for public discovery. Only minor drift: Captain Veyra’s awe arrives quickly, slightly undercutting relational crucible.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam into clouds reconfigures the ship’s status and Arlen’s identity with undeniable cost. Causal chain—phrasebook clue → hopscotch map → luminance beacon—holds cleanly. One seamless scene, orientation anchored by teak deck and starlings within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Airship’s brass groans and balloon seams are tactile constraints that later channel light; starling murmurations mirror wind currents and luminance shifts, integrating setting into choice. Micro-setting (hopscotch grid on teak) becomes the pivotal tool. Sensory hierarchy filtered through Arlen’s cartographer eye. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—charting blank spaces—tightens when hopscotch reveals a way to steer light; each numbered hop narrows options and raises stakes. Agency drives escalation: Arlen’s three nights of cross-referencing, then public demonstration. Cost is visible: the luminous beam exposes the ship to unknown attention. No coincidence resolves; every turn stems from prior choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of discovery as dialogue with the world emerges through concrete particulars: phrasebook margins, chalk dust, starling spirals. Final image—Arlen whispering back to blank spaces—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in silence when crew stomp through the grid, altering light. Complexity preserved; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: precise cartographer diction (“fractal spirals,” “nodes of that light”) fused with lyrical wonder. Syntax mirrors Arlen’s meticulous yet awestruck mind. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Dialogue minimal but natural when it appears. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during hops, longer cadences at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers map lore, sensory detail, or causal link. Metaphors are fresh (“lute strung with sunbeams”) and coherent. No loops or scaffold; zero filter-verb stacks. Minor elevated diction (“undeniable conceptual cost”) fits reflective beat, not peak action. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses orphan cartographer, polyglot relic, hopscotch cipher, and light-bending airship into an inevitable synthesis. Risky hopscotch-as-map device is fully grounded in chalk wear and bird response. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped. Fresh angle on discovery trope; no close echoes.</comment>
