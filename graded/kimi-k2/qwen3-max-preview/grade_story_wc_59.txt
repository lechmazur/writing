<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the egg cradled “with exhaustion and hope” crystallizes motive. Micro-choices (threading copper veins, calibrating pendulums) reveal hierarchy of values. Final kneel-laugh embodies earned cost. Minor drift: “obsolete” label edges diagnostic-speak but is quickly re-anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the palace awakens, mirrors shatter into living skies, cost is the prince’s years of ridicule and bodily depletion. Causal lens holds—each beat (“therefore” linkage) narrows to the egg’s activation. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: acid rain and bureaucrat laughter shape tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Suspended palace, stalactite chains, and iron plains are selective, purposeful, and constrain every move. Micro-setting (egg cradle of brass petals) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy under stress—acid rain, steam-whistle—mirrors internal state. No spatial drift; chandeliers sway in sync with heartbeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment. One decisive deepening: the egg’s glow re-tunes the world’s frequency, foreclosing the mechanical status quo. Cost is visible: prince’s frayed tunic, dented crown, acid-scarred lungs. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as oxygen, not luxury. Final image of mirrors reflecting living skies reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence: the egg’s dormancy speaks louder than any thesis. Complexity preserved—no tidy redemption for the mechanical world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; “chromatic pulses, like dawn breaking through stormclouds” stays within prince’s perceptual lexicon. Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses under acid rain, longer cadences during lullabies. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Experimental elision (mirrors reflecting other skies) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, stakes, and motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Rust persuaded to bloom into pigment” is precise and character-bound. Minor scaffold: “the reason he still rose each dawn” could trim, but momentum recovers instantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk ruin wedded to lyrical resurrection myth. Tropes transformed—egg not MacGuffin but tuning fork for reality. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final mirror-shatter. Specificity anchors universals; no interchangeable placeholders. Transformation test passes—story collapses if prince becomes generic tinkerer.</comment>
