<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“lilac unease settling into her bones”), yet the decisive change—her smile at the tile’s fracture—arrives with earned cost. Motivations remain consistent: her need to “listen more than draw” drives every micro-choice. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“socially perceptive nature had always let her read crowds…”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked tile and dissolving mandala crystallize a new stance toward noise and silence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer thickens until the final harmonic tone reweights meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 120 words. One minor elision: the exact moment she chooses to leave the mandala untouched is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, damp sand, and limestone scent constrain every gesture; the tile flake itself becomes micro-setting that vibrates through the sand and reconfigures the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (“scent of wet limestone and moss rising like a question mark”) mirrors internal stakes. Environment actively shapes tactics—she kneels, traces, listens—rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how silence could hold intention”—tightens via the emergent hush’s density increase. Agency is exercised through finger-swirls that redirect the mandala’s whispers; the cost is the tile’s fracture and the irreversible dispersal of stored echoes. One clear beat of deepening, no reversals, sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is not fixed but shaped through attentive creation and dissolution. Subtext lives in gesture—the refusal to chalk the city walls that night—rather than statement. Final image of rain “a mandala in motion” reweights the premise without moralizing. Only a whisper of thematic echo in the closing aphorism, but it feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“mist curled like breath around her ankles”). Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic (“lilac unease”) and tactile. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression and elision are taught early (“she wasn’t sketching portraits or sunsets”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or interiority. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “like iron filings near a magnet” is a stock simile, but it arrives early and serves clarity. No loops or redundancy near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sensory magic with quiet epistemology; the “emergent hush” as palpable medium feels fresh. Transformation test: story would collapse if tile flake or mandala mechanics were swapped for generic symbols. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens. Specificity of chalk artist’s unlearning process is non-transferable.</comment>
