<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“dust on fingertips,” “slow erosion of soul”), motivation remains coherent, and the final renunciation—choosing partial visibility without spectacle—carries felt cost. The crawl-space dweller’s contradictory impulses (longing to be seen vs. fear of exposure) act simultaneously in the placement of the tape fragment. Minor deduction for the off-page intern who lacks individuated pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dweller remains unseen yet achieves resonance, reconfiguring the stakes from invisibility to relational echo. Causal chain is tight: discovery of fragment → placement → intern’s reaction → posted note, each beat narrowing options toward the crystallized stance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; pattern of cached offerings taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Library’s “fractured sapphire hush” and crawl-space ducts act as micro-settings that constrain movement and cache placement. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, static cling, wood sigh) is filtered through the dweller’s tactile expertise. The tape fragment as object-setting charges the final image. No orientation debt; anchors clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—visibility versus erasure—tightens through each cached offering until the tape fragment’s placement forecloses total invisibility. Agency is renunciation: she gives away the relic to be felt, not seen. Cost is the lingering ache of partial recognition. Escalation is pattern-break: first deliberate exposure to staff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen, partial visibility emerges from concrete acts, never stated. Subtext in the posted note—“If you’re listening…”—mirrors the reel’s ghost-voice, reweighting the premise: resonance can substitute for appearance. Final image crystallizes without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited dweller POV remains stable; perceptual signature is haptic and sonic (“fingertips brushing dust,” “low thrum of recorded voices”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise—longer cadence in reflection, clipped fragments under tension. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “a broken promise” compresses history and emotion in three words. Rhythm accelerates during discovery and slows during reflection. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Final sentence—“Visibility wasn’t spectacle. It was resonance.”—earns its declarative power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival archaeology as spiritual practice, invisibility as chosen resonance rather than curse. Specificity of reel fragment, 1973 ticket, and boiler-room nest makes the concept unrepeatable. Risk in quiet ending pays off through charged poise.</comment>
