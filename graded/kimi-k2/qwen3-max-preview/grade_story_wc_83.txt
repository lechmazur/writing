<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and trauma-tuned, but the “calibrated desperation” summary edges toward diagnostic label-speak; the final leap into the dark earns cost via the geode’s pulse syncing her heartbeat, yet the absence of any second character keeps relational stakes off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory leaps, the map is accepted, and the cost—utter solitude and irreversible trajectory—is legible in the final image. Causal chain (geode → coordinates → burn) holds; mosaic shards are few and transitions smooth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero-gravity halls, mirrored domes, and the violet geode are vivid and selective; the observatory itself constrains her final choice by being the only vessel capable of the burn. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail narrows under crisis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cartography of lost futures—is signaled early and tightens through each simulation collapse; the final burn forecloses return, paying a visible price. Pressure escalates via algorithmic overload and cooling capacitors, not external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvaging unused potential emerges from the geode’s whispered coordinates and the protagonist’s refusal to let grief ossify; the ending reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence after named whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, trauma-sharpened; perceptual signature filters every detail through loss. Syntax accelerates with thruster ignition; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (crystal “like spilled mercury”) are precise and earned. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt exhilarated”) are brief and do not stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grief-cartography, orbital physics, and violet geode resonance feels inevitable and non-obvious; the risk of a lone mourner mapping quantum ghosts pays off in a final image that reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
