<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling fingers, tide-pool eyes—but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the final act of release is more posture than pressured decision, so the cost feels attenuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seashell’s placement and the blank page crystallize a stance of renunciation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the cameos tighten into cadence—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded nexus is tactile and constraining; the spiral seashell’s final resting place recharges the pier at dawn. Spatial anchors are clear, and the micro-setting (shell, mist, pier) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to collect the shapes of different hopes”—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo. The tightening is the refusal to capture them, but the price (unfinished manuscript) is more abstract than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: the refusal to package truth. The final sentence, “not for an audience… but as an offering,” reweights the entire journey without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (“tide pools at dawn,” “swirling hush”) is consistent. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. No loops or scaffold; minor register drift (“feral nexus”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “solemnizing through cameo appearances” is fresh and non-obvious; the transformation of observation into release feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
