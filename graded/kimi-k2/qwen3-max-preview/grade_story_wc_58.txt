<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the traveler's contradictory impulses—mapping absence to keep the gone present—are dramatized in every micro-choice (folding the crane, tucking it beneath the roots). Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation: not closure, but orientation. The thread-as-memory constrains tactics and charges the ending with felt cost. No slips.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the folded crane under the rosebush crystallizes the reconfiguration—absence becomes vividly present without magic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each obituary layer deepens the pattern until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the thread’s faint warmth and the garden’s deepening shadows. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden, thread, and autumn decay are filtered through the traveler’s biased perception; every sensory detail (lichen tears, ivy-choked arches) constrains the act of writing and the final burial of the crane. The micro-setting of wrist-thread and damp stone functions as intimate geography that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Minor redundancy in “bruised twilight” and “shadowed garden” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence to keep the gone present—is signaled early and tightens through each obituary beat. The final crane-folding is a meaningful deepening that forecloses the option of forgetting; cost is visible in the thread’s glow and the traveler’s renunciation of hope. Agency remains with the traveler; no coincidence resolves tension. Slight abstraction in “geography of healing” softens visceral bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the traveler’s act: grief as cartography, absence as presence. Subtext resides in gesture (folding, tucking) and silence rather than statement. The final image—“every step stitches sky to sea”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is embraced; no tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and character-bound; perceptual signature is selective and biased toward absence. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, winding sentences mirror the act of mapping, then tighten at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor loop—“garden sighed… shadows deepening, autumn asserting”—is offset by rhythmic control. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is high; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. One near-redundant clause (“beauty carved from decay, majesty worn thin by time”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Premise—writing obituaries for the living to map absence—is fresh and executed with specific, grounded detail. The transformation of grief into cartography feels inevitable in hindsight. No stock tropes; the palace-carpet thread and autumn garden are particular to this voice. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the charged closure image.</comment>
