<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s understated competence and embodied memory anchor every beat; her “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tweezers, dynamo, key). Interiority stays concrete, but the final vanish feels slightly unearned—no visible cost or flaw exposed—so the renunciation lands just shy of full resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the broadcast rewrites public memory, and Elira’s disappearance crystallizes the cost of resistance. Causal chain—puddle map → hatch → Archive Engine—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor slack: the blackout’s power-source logistics are elided, but it doesn’t rupture the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lagoon’s mirrored surface and submerged hatch are not backdrop; they guide Elira’s path and supply the final vanishing point. Sensory economy favors reflected light and wet sand, all filtered through her scavenger’s eye. The setting constrains movement and charges the final image—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore erased histories—tightens when the blackout spreads; each splice of tape narrows escape routes. Agency is high, cost visible in sirens and forfeited anonymity. One escalation beat suffices, but the physical stakes never truly threaten Elira’s body, muting the visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: memory as insurgency, silence as complicity. Subtext lives in the Ace of Keys left behind—an unspoken manifesto. No moralizing; the final image reframes the lagoon as both archive and getaway. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, yet grounded in Elira’s scavenger diction—“salt-bleached driftwood,” “oily streetwater.” Syntax modulates with tension; longer cadences collapse into clipped fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, almost no scaffolding. Metaphors are fresh (“mirrors swallowing dusk like a secret”) and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates during splice sequence, then breathes at the end. Minor risk of purple in “auric fire,” but it pays off in closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia is re-energized by analog Archive Engine and puddle-map navigation. The transformation of obsolete tech into insurgent tool feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Specificity of cassette tapes and punch cards roots the concept in tactile detail, achieving non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
