<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers “reading braille left by forgotten gods,” the tear blotted beside the levitation formula—but the decisive change (renouncing formula for wonder) is slightly under-motivated; we feel the awe more than the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flame becomes “warmth held in the air,” a covenant kept; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the pattern of memory-light-starling resonance tightening to a single resonant image with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard, waterfall, and crystal are tactile constraints: the moss-slick stones ground her knees, the chromatic veil guides the starling reading; final image of blossoms unfurling mid-winter charges the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will rigor eclipse wonder?—tightens via the crystal’s hum and the starlings’ dance; the deepening is one elegant intensification, but the price (loss of the crystal) is more symbolic than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pressed petals, levitation tear, murmuration runes; final line “wonder was not the opposite of wisdom—it was its oldest, truest name” is earned, not asserted, and reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation and precise diction (“coaxing blue heat from air and will”); perceptual signature is consistent—scientist’s taxonomy meets child’s awe—without head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional lyric surplus (“living tapestries,” “divine canvas”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum; no loops or scaffold, and the final cadence lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy, memory-crystal, and starling murmuration feels fresh; avoids stock fantasy tropes by grounding wonder in sensory specificity; risk lies in lyric mode, but coherence holds.</comment>
