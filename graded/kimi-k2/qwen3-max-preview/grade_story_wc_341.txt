<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between her scientific past and grief-driven cataloguing is palpable. The final smile is earned by the ledger entries and telescope cradling, showing cost. Yet the “quietly explosive” trait is asserted more than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—her smile crystallizes the new stance that absence is vessel, not void, with felt cost in the thinning cloud. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cloud entry deepens density until the final release. One minor drift: the violin-string backstory arrives late and summarized, not dramatized, but it does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gondola, telescope, and sky function as micro-setting that constrains every choice—height, sway, limited tools. Starlight “clung like powdered memory” charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. Weather is not just backdrop but emotional barometer, fully integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving emptiness remembers—tightens through each cloud classification; the final dissolution of Altocumulus #112 forces the crystallized stance. Agency is observational, yet the act of memorializing carries visible cost in charcoal nub and salt-stained ledger. Pressure escalates accumulatively; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of naming clouds by grief; no moralizing. The reprise of “quietly explosive” in the final cloud reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the fraying coat hem and unshed rain invites reflection on presence interrupted. Resonance lingers in the scent of pine and unfinished conversations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with perceptual signature in meteorological emotion-lexicon. Syntax mirrors sway and hush—“the sky wept in patterns only the broken could read.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression taught early (“spooled wholeness”) and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence advancing image or pressure. Occasional stacked metaphors (“frayed thread,” “powdered memory,” “old lace”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught and serves closure. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with gondola sway. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—grief-stricken meteorologist classifying clouds as emotions—feels fresh and inevitable. Brass telescope and ledger transform from props to relics. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; specificity of Stratocumulus #47 and Altocumulus #112 anchors universals.</comment>
