<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (“her fingers brushing the paper like a prayer”), but the final renunciation is slightly under-motivated: the pivot from shame to self-acceptance feels compressed rather than earned by a visible micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she reclaims the library at dawn with cost legible in the invitation pinned like a declaration. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The library’s frescoes, creaking floorboards, and moonlit aisle constrain her final stance; the “Paradoxes Unbound” shelf is a micro-setting that literally reorders itself, charging the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-acceptance vs exile—tightens once when she smooths the invitation; pressure deepens as midnight nears and books shift, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy as lens, not flaw. The invitation’s reprise reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “enlarged tranquility.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature (“catalogued silence between bookshelves”). No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; only minor loops (“whispering of a world that had tried—and failed—to forget her”) slightly dilute momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: secret library as sanctuary for paradox, empathy as curatorial act. The crumpled self-invitation is a non-obvious engine that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
