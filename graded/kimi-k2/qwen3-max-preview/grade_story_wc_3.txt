<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse syncing with the arbor’s thrum, her smile at the seed’s split—but the “three dissertations” backstory is delivered in summary, not dramatized micro-choice, slightly blunting the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each cuneiform gesture layers density until the seed’s split reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she bows and leaves, foreclosing possession—cost felt in her refusal to claim the new glyph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The magnetic arbor’s light-bending limbs and solidified-memory soil are specific, tactile, and constrain every action; the final seedling’s silver tendrils charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“understand transition without rupture”—tightens through each analogical gesture; the seed’s tremor and split mark the decisive intensification, with the cost of renunciation legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the seed’s germination: transition as lingering rather than leaving. The invented “forgiveness” glyph and final bow offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“threading through the magnetic hum like a needle through silk”—with consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and the cadence modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“not with force, but with patience, with care”) slightly dulls momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cuneiform-as-code premise, magnetic arbor, and “physics of transition” synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole; the invented glyph and refusal to translate it crystallize the risk without gimmickry.</comment>
