<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s reinventions and her mother’s lullaby are embodied through tactile pigeon-work and meteorite calibration; the final refusal to keep forging new selves lands with visible cost when she laughs until her ribs ache and leaves the ledgers open. Interior contradictions (preservation vs erasure) play out in micro-choices—embedding the chip, redesigning harnesses—rather than exposition. The shift from secrecy to open composition is earned by prior pattern of flight logs becoming scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic turns from reliquary to living archive when Argent sings the resurrected lullaby. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mapping of dust, each calibration of the chip layers density until the pattern crystallizes in song. The cost is felt in the cracked-open ribs and the first returned letter that proves the past can answer back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The attic’s cedar scent, leaning shelves, and cracked skylight constrain every action—grain is measured there, dust is mapped there, the meteorite is tested there. The micro-setting of the skylight’s light pool becomes the crucible where gravity and grace are balanced. Final image reuses the same dust motes now settling on the Reykjavik letter, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve songs before they vanish—tightens when the meteorite proves it can resurrect instead of merely record. One decisive intensification: redesigning harnesses to embed the chip, risking the birds and her own emotional safety. Cost is visible in the weeping, the smeared ink, and the laughter that hurts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs self-erasure emerges through concrete objects—ledgers, meteorite, dust patterns—never stated. The final image of dust applauding on the letter offers a non-literal answer: memory survives not by hiding but by sending it outward. Subtext operates in the silence between releases and the unsent letters finally answered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets,” “bruised clouds”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during releases and breathes during mapping. Compression is purposeful: “She wept quietly, ink smearing her latest log” carries entire emotional beat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elara’s cartographer mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture or advances action. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“miniature nebula,” “living archive winging”—without purple overload. Zero loops or scaffold; even repeated motifs (dust, skylight) accrue new meaning each pass.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Pigeon-borne song resurrection tuned by Martian meteorite is a fresh synthesis; the transformation of flight logs into musical scores feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of foxed paper, obsolete trade routes, and child’s dream-song in Reykjavik anchors the fantastical in lived detail. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, quiet ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
