<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror maker’s interiority is embodied and specific—calloused hands, breath-counting, memory of childhood dream—but the final choice to absorb the dream lacks a visible cost that alters her stance; she ends cradling the mirror with no felt forfeiture or change in self-definition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream’s absorption reweights the orchard from ruin to fleeting bloom, and the fog’s return confirms a boundary erased. Causal chain holds—sextant shards → harmonic resonance → dream descent → mirror capture—under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog, frost, and sextant shards constrain every beat: frost pulses with breath, shards levitate and cast light that revives extinct blossoms. The orchard’s ruined state and momentary bloom charge the final image when fog re-thickens, sealing the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—tightens through synchronized breathing that narrows options to one final exhale. Pressure escalates as fog thins and blossoms erupt, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges through image and action: dream flows into mirror, orchard blooms then reverts, fog lifts then returns. No moralizing; the final thickening fog offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the price of permeability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is glass-edged and luminous, with rhythmic control—“inhaling for seven counts, holding for three, exhaling for eleven”—that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: the mirror maker notices through craft, weight, and shimmer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or breath-cadence. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Glass mountains” refrain crystallizes tone without overwriting. Final image—“The fog thickened again”—lands clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: broken sextant as dream-lure, orchard fog as liminal membrane, mirror as threshold. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure. Specificity prevents trope drift; no other story could swap these elements unchanged.</comment>
