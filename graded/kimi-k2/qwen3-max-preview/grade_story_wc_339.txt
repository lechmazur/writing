<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s analytic detachment is embodied through precise sensory cataloguing and micro-choices (refusing food, whispering names). The final release of the globe is earned by the prior pattern of embodied experiments; the cost is the hollow warmth left in his palms. Interior contradiction—logic vs grief—remains active in scene, not summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe’s unmaking reweights the premise from relic to receiver, converting mass to light. Causal linkage holds—each whispered datum tightens the pattern until the final thread snaps. The cost is legible in the “hollow and humming” aftermath. No orientation debt; shards are legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The snow globe itself functions as micro-setting; its temperature and vortex constrain every experiment and charge the final image. Sunken ship library is sketched in two vivid strokes, then abandoned—sufficient for this length. Sensory selection (salt silence, mercury cold) is filtered through the POV’s scientific bias. Environment guides choice: only the cliff wind allows the final release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—tightens through each anomalous reading until the globe’s final unmaking forecloses further study. Agency is exercised in the deliberate release; the cost is the irreversible loss of the object and the analytic project. Pressure grows via pattern accumulation rather than external antagonist; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and surrender; no explicit statement intrudes. The final image of the silver thread dissolving into clouds reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the unspoken comparison between Earhart’s laughter and the narrator’s hollow wave to Death. Complexity is preserved—no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: clinical diction (“thermodynamic laws,” “spectral analyses”) braided with lyrical compression (“salt and silence”). Rhythm accelerates under sleep deprivation—short paratactic bursts mirror pulse sync. Perceptual signature is consistent: the world is noticed as data until the final sensory inversion (warm wind). No head-hopping; interiority stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: each sentence layers information (“mahogany shelves warped by salt and silence”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise (blizzard as pulse). Line-level craft peaks in the final paragraph where diction thins to single stressed monosyllables—“I stood there, hollow and humming”—mirroring emotional evacuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—an emotional receiver disguised as a snow globe—feels inevitable yet fresh. Earhart’s transcendence is reimagined as literal unknotted gravity; the sunken library as engineered ritual. Specificity anchors the speculative leap: 0.3°C drop on whispered name. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final unmaking. No derivative echoes.</comment>
