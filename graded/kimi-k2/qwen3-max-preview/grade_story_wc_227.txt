<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the kintsugi metaphor binds memory to action. The final renunciation (“the version of me I abandoned”) lands with felt cost. Minor drift: “weight of kintsugi intentions” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the workshop becomes an altar, cost paid in tears and dwindling air. Causal chain—each lacquered scar tightens the stake—holds under Accumulative lens. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acid sea and gear-grate vents constrain movement and supply literal countdown pressure. The key ring charm functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (green fumes, trembling floor) never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before the sea dissolves the raft”—escalates with each gilded scar. Agency drives every beat; the final tear-lacquer forecloses retreat. Cost is visible and scaled to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the alchemist’s act: brokenness made sacred without moralizing. Final image of the workshop-as-altar reweights the premise. Subtext in the silent fox charm carries memory and loss without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; patterned elision (“acid sea that hissed like a chorus of dying serpents”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses as the hull splits. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, stakes, or memory. Metaphors are coherent and crisis-tuned. Zero loops or scaffold; final tear-gold line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi alchemy on a dissolving raft. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no stock tropes. The acid-sea workshop feels singular—remove any detail and the spell frays.</comment>
