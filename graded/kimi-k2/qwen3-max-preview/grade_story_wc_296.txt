<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the druid’s contradictory impulses (fear of revelation vs hunger for truth) act simultaneously. The final unbending is earned through the seed’s slow invasion and her micro-choice to breathe, not scream. Flaw: the “mirrors lie” epiphany is slightly abstract; a more visceral cue would sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard collapses into a single point of light she carries away, reweighting her mission. Causal linkage holds—each circle the seed blooms forecloses denial until the vortex stills. Cost is visible on the page: ribs “crack—not with pain, but release.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop; its inverted branches and frozen blossoms physically constrain her steps and later reconfigure into stars. Micro-setting (the seed fused to her brow) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs self-protection—tightens with each expanding circle. Agency drives escalation: she kneels, presses palm, breathes into the invasion. The final thaw of confessions is earned, not coincidental. One visible cost: her guarded heart is literally cracked open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the seed’s method: revelation through patient unbending. Subtext is carried by petals that whisper buried names and by the mirror motif that reframes identity. The ending’s non-literal answer—“the face you are when no one is watching”—reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (“cloak woven from thorn-vines and silence”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under invasion, longer cadences during reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise (“petals like shards of stained glass”) and internally consistent. High information density without overwriting—e.g., “roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins, tracing scars.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “journey to the underworld” into a botanic-psychic inversion. The flesh-eating seed as truth engine is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off: the orchard becomes compass, the lake drains skyward, yet causality remains legible.</comment>
