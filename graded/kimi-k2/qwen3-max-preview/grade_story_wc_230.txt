<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the forager’s contradictory need to speak truth yet shield others charges every beat. Micro-choices—kneeling to the soil, placing the eye—reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the relic crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor: the three newcomers remain functional rather than individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens; closure lands as Charged Poise when she releases the eye, reweighting safety from possession to trust. Causality holds: each beat (finding truffles, offering them, relinquishing relic) tightens the emotional stakes. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the relinquished talisman.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hanging orchard is more than backdrop: swaying bridges and rotting fruit mirror emotional precarity and supply the truffles that drive the plot. Sensory detail is selective—petrichor, moss-slick roots, fungal scent—filtered through the forager’s priorities. Environment constrains the final choice: the lightning-split tree becomes the eye’s new home, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—tightens when newcomers arrive seeking calm. Agency: she chooses to share truffles and then to release the relic, each act narrowing her own protection to broaden others’. Escalation is one deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for length. Cost is the loss of personal buffer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of safety as cultivated surrender emerges through action, not statement. Subtext in the eye’s journey—from shield to gift—reweights the premise: safety grows wild when unowned. Final image of laughter without tears crystallizes the thematic shift. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in the forager’s perceptual signature—mycelial whispers, fungal wisdom. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; compression in “You remember balance” teaches the pattern. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—no purple drift. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“psychological safety”) is earned by context and character lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-viral empathy contagion and truffle-foraged neurochemistry create a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The orchard suspended in a storm-ravine feels singular; relic-as-occlusion-device is transformed from cliché into lived tool. Risk-taking in structure (quiet release over set-piece) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
