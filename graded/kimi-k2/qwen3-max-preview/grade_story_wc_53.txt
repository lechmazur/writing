<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“I must negotiate with my own ghost”—and embodied in the spire encounter. Micro-choices (winding camera, accepting envelope) show hierarchy of values. Flawed ambition is dramatized, not labeled. Final renunciation feels earned by prior regret and cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment and camera click layers density until the drawer opens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ghost dissolves, protagonist sits in Earned Stasis with visible cost of relinquishing film. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cloud-top lagoon is tactile: salt-crusted planks, corroded flash. Micro-setting of camera lodged in calliope ribs constrains later choice to give it up. Twin moons and stilled islands mirror internal stasis. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no floating geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation with ghost—tightens when camera is demanded. One deepening: ghost mimes adjusting lens, forcing shift from collecting others’ ghosts to facing own regret. Cost is relinquishing camera and accepting “frame, not fix.” No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars: expired film, carousel stasis, envelope message. Subtext in ghost’s gesture and final silence. No moralizing; resonance is felt in “I do not regret.” Ambiguity lingers—was the ascent worth it?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent: “boots crunch on salt-crusted planks,” “wind it manually, click by click.” Perceptual signature filters everything through scavenger bias. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors are precise—“like breath caught mid-sigh.” No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates toward final flash then settles into quiet cadence. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Carousel above clouds, expired camera, ghost negotiation synthesize familiar tropes into fresh emotional engine. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity—“child’s voice inside a cracked teacup”—anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
