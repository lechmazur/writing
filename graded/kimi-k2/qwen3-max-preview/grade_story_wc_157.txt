<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—seed under tongue, humming lullaby—yet the shift from solitary rebel to community catalyst feels compressed; Dr. Vex’s pivot from suspicion to ally is credible but thinly dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gourd’s future resonance crystallizes stakes without tidy payoff. Causal chain (seed → vine → coded garden → collective spark) holds; the greenhouse as sanctuary buys time with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse humidity, pinned wings, and surveillance moths constrain every move; the gourd vine’s spiral becomes a living map. Sensory selection mirrors POV priorities—damp moss tiles under boots, dew angles at dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—smuggling banned grammar—tightens when Dr. Vex reroutes moths and neighbors decode vines. One meaningful escalation: rogue scholar’s act becomes communal defiance with visible social risk.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from soil and syntax: language as living resistance. Final image—children singing outlawed lullabies—reweights prior material without moralizing; ambiguity lingers on cost of rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; “candidly cryptic” diction mirrors scholar’s double stance. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sharp—she notices surveillance moths through condensation on spectacles.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: “glass panes rattled with converging chaos” marries sound and stakes. No loops; each sentence layers sensory, thematic, and causal work. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tax on cognition + greenhouse insurgency + gourd semaphore. Risky conceit executed with internal logic; transformation test passed—story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
