<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—trembling hands, aching molars—yet the “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted more than dramatized until late. His micro-choice to dismantle and re-embed the lens is credible and costly, but the shift from resignation to resolve could be seeded earlier to tighten causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lens’s transformation from distress beacon to lullaby of release is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the undertaker’s lifelong exile now becomes infinite custodianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each shard placement deepens the pattern until the final amber pulse reweights all prior grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned library is not mere backdrop; its silted aisles and floating folios constrain movement and supply the literal architecture for the beacon. The marble statue’s hollow eye socket becomes the final prism seat, charging the closing image with site-specific inevitability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering the dead’s unrest—tightens with each shard placed; the cost is the undertaker’s irrevocable commitment to remain below. One clear deepening suffices: the moment he kneels in reverence, knowing he can never leave, forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: rest is not burial but recognition. The lens’s re-tuning from SOS to lullaby enacts this without sermon, letting the final fade of impressions carry the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“salt-crusted package,” “ink bleeding into whispers”—and sustains a consistent perceptual signature of a man who has catalogued silence. No head-hopping; the free-indirect drift into dream logic is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic weight without redundancy. Metaphors (“prisms fractured like frozen lightning”) are fresh and coherent, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—undertaker as engineer of post-mortem Wi-Fi—feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing grief, technology, and theology in a way no trope checklist predicts. Risky deep-sea gothic pays off through specificity and earned closure.</comment>
