<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her pride in the “moss and machine oil” paradox, the tactile memory-work of winters and autumns—but the decisive moment (lifting the final note) is slightly under-motivated; we feel her reverence more than the cost of surrender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the arbor’s song is rekindled (Decisive Change) with conceptual cost—the past chorus dissolves, leaving only living air. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each remembered melody accretes until the Moonroot blooms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor is not backdrop but instrument: dew, creaking wood, and the vine’s pulse constrain every gesture. Final image of the curled wreath charges the setting with future obligation, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore forgotten song—tightens through each refrain; the vine’s glow is the visible price. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the cost is more luminous than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: remembrance as living contract. The final doorway of light reweights earlier murals and lullabies without sermon, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, consistent; perceptual signature (“brass goggles reflected the first amber rays”) stays anchored. No head-hopping; even the child’s voice is filtered through arbor acoustics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; only minor cadence repetition (“how the harvest moon… how villagers… how song…”) nicks momentum. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of clockwork tinkerer and plant-magic feels inevitable; the Moonroot singing under true intent is a fresh synthesis. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
