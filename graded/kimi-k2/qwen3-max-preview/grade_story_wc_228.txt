<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the painter’s contradictory impulses (to return vs. to leave the shell) crystallize in the cave. The final renunciation—leaving the shell—earns its cost through prior beats. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Motive remains consistent and intensifies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the act of painting the cave wall and leaving the shell reconfigures the promise from burden to covenant. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of silence and mineral time taught early and held. No orientation debt; spatial anchors clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the final whisper and stiff legs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coastal cave functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—darkness dictates candle use, wet stone dictates painting with pool water. Salt crystals and kelp-slick steps are selective, purposeful. Final image of tide lapping the threshold recharges the cave’s breath. No credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the promise—tightens when the mirror cracks and the cave demands a new form of witness. One meaningful deepening: painting the wall shifts the promise from possession to enactment. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and atmospheric. Cost is the relinquishing of the shell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence vs. process, reflection vs. motion. Subtext in the shell’s slow burial by minerals reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the shell preserved under time layers offers conceptual repricing. No tidy epiphany—ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through painterly attention. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free-indirect style clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in cave, clipped on dock. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“tide lapping like a tongue”) are precise and earned. Sentence variety supports cadence; paragraph cuts purposeful. No typos or tense slips. Final line anchors earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-to-cave arc is transformed by the painter’s specific covenant and the shell’s mineral fate. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative phrasing or echo of famous lines. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
