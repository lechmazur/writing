<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“smoke in her lungs and silence in her throat”), but the brother-fire backstory is delivered in one reflective block that slightly flattens pressure. Micro-choices (angling prisms, tucking the tooth) align with motives and show earned renunciation. No contradictory impulses in scene; cost is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s “reverence” crystallizes the reconfiguration of hope. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of prism placements deepens stakes. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible. Cost is visible in her aching knees and the rose’s last petal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Harbor moonlight and rusted grating are tactile and selective; the prism-as-tool constrains her choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (the railing, the hook) is leveraged for action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—offering fragile beauty against gray—is signaled early and tightened by each prism placement. Escalation is accumulative; no causal reversals, but each reflection raises the cost of failure. Agency is renunciation: she leaves the prisms to work, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience measured in millimeters of light. Subtext in the lockmaster’s tooth reweights from key to gauge. Final image refracts theme without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature is gardener-pragmatic (“wistfully pragmatic hands”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not purple. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm mirrors oar-stroke patience. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous harbor”) fits lyric mode. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—moonlit prism-gardening on a fire escape—feels fresh and inevitable. Trope of “light in darkness” is transformed through tactile specificity. Risky lyric structure holds. No derivative echoes.</comment>
