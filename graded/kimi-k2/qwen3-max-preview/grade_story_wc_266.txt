<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira and Torvin embody “gently persistent” through tactile micro-choices (moss-touching, ear-to-bark listening), but the collective “guides” remain archetypal; no single interior contradiction is dramatized under pressure, and the final renunciation is felt more as choral ethos than individual cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-punch perforation layers quiet light until the ridge-crest artifacts crystallize the pilgrimage’s meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—courage remembered, not reclaimed—with conceptual cost legible in the town’s dawn doorframes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The veiled ridgeway’s salt-laden wind, moss-slick railings, and star-punch holes leaking light constrain route choices and charge the final image; micro-setting (child’s shoe, rusted whistle) anchors the vigil without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—tightens through reverent detours and the absence of pursuit; the deepening is a shift from seeking to witnessing, paid for by the guides’ lighter, shared burden at descent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of small absences (shoe, whistle) rather than statement; the shoreline lullaby motif reweights from comfort to benediction without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person plural sustains a hushed, collective perceptual signature; diction (“salt and silence on their tongues,” “roots curled like question marks”) modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; no loops or scaffold, metaphors stay coherent, and rhythm breathes with the pilgrimage’s slow cadence. Occasional elevated phrasing (“veiled ridgeways,” “crystallized final moment”) remains within the mythic register taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing ferry-guide folklore with a quiet quest for dormant courage feels fresh; the star-punch as threshold marker transforms a mundane tool into luminous cartography, avoiding familiar quest tropes.</comment>
