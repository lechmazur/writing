<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skimmer’s stillness-as-stance is embodied and specific; the arrowhead’s grooves-as-prayers anchor interiority without exposition. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. Micro-choices are implied rather than shown, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the skimmer’s refusal to move crystallizes the new role of “landmark,” with centuries of waiting as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer of dust and wingbeat tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-tower micro-setting constrains every beat: calcified ribs dictate posture, noon-shadow on the third rib marks passage. Sensory selection is urgent—wind-shift felt in marrow, not air. Canyon “exhale” and obsidian crows charge the final image without ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming the pulse’s keeper—tightens once: the flock’s break west forces the skimmer to accept perpetual stillness. Cost is the forfeiture of motion itself, legible in the closing “would not journey today. Nor tomorrow.” No escalation loop; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refusal: guidance is mirrored, not chased. The arrowhead’s worn facets and the pulse’s wandering embody the idea without statement. Final image—“silence shaped by centuries”—offers resonant, non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary, tactile, and consistent: “marrow of its bones,” “fossilized marrow.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature is skimmer-bound. Compression is purposeful; elisions (“Generations had died…”) are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers density. Metaphors (“physics dressed in reverence”) are precise and non-contradictory. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths for canyon age, clipped fragments for flock turns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the immobile sage into a receiver of aerial physics; the pulse-as-physics-in-reverence is a fresh synthesis. Specificity of bone towers and crow murmuration makes the concept unportable. Risk in stillness-as-plot pays off in closure.</comment>
