<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“her heartbeat syncing with the rustle of ferns”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics. The final renunciation—accepting perpetual guardianship—earns stasis yet the cost feels diffuse rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is not silenced but cradled, reweighting the summoner’s purpose. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the crane’s ascent crystallizes the shift. Cost is conceptual—“she would return tomorrow…”—but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The brook, moonlight, and moss function as micro-setting that constrains movement and attention; the origami wing’s drift and glow charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, though “terrestrially cosmic” edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing a sky that forgets dawn—is signaled early and tightened through the summoner’s shift from silencing to listening. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens; the price is quiet endurance rather than visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: prophecy as plea rather than doom, listening as guardianship. Subtext in the crane’s glow and whispered memory avoids moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, compressed, and internally coherent. Perceptual signature is strong (“water’s murmur flowed not as sound but as texture”). No head-hopping; diction and cadence modulate with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting (“terrestrially cosmic rhythm”) but rhythm remains varied. No loops or scaffold artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—summoner who maps silence to cradle prophecy—feels fresh. Tropes of prophecy and origami are transformed through quiet, attentive stance. Synthesis is specific; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
