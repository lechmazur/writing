<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s color-blind synesthesia and Marta’s shift from merchant to student are embodied through tactile choices; the “bartered awakenings” ethic forces micro-choices that reconfigure their relationship. Interior contradictions (salvage vs spectacle) play out in plant placements and the kiln promise, earning the final stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: reed tongue’s first hum → plant spirals → dusk resonance → shoot emergence → kiln vow. Each beat layers density and reweights the courtyard’s “alive” status; closure crystallizes in Marta’s “we wake the kiln,” a Charged Poise that forecloses passive spectatorship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Courtyard’s cobblestones, ash-patterns, and plant mechanics anchor every move; the reed tongue under the slate tile functions as micro-setting that literally transmits vibration. Environmental details constrain tactics (plant stiffness, root depth) and charge the final image with the kiln’s latent heat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: can broken aftermath yield living beauty? Pressure tightens through each plant arrangement—each spacing a question the courtyard must answer. The green shoots pushing through ash mark the decisive intensification; cost is the labor and risk of tomorrow’s kiln firing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from salvage ethics: beauty in imperfection, value in aftermath. Subtext hums in the reed’s unheard tone and the phoenix’s shadow—images that reweight meaning without exposition. Final image of waking the kiln offers non-literal answer: creation born of ruin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person limited through Elias’s synesthetic perception; Marta’s speech (“Teach me”) and barefoot stance carry distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn description to terse dusk exchange, mirroring rising tension. No head-hopping; POV distance stays controlled.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “green wasn’t green… but the damp velvet of moss” compresses synesthesia and stakes. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances texture or choice. Figurative language stays coherent; mixed metaphors avoided. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blind synesthesia + plant linguistics + post-phoenix salvage. Reed tongue as translator between root and air feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky quiet magic grounded in tactile detail; no genre clichés. Transformation test passed—story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
