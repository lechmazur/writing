<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caretaker’s refusal to breach her crack turns her endurance into an Earned Stasis: she sacrifices volume to keep the ghosts breathing, a deliberate price felt on the last breath of chime-note. Contradiction—the need to name versus her vow of non-summoning—plays out in embodied micro-choices as she sways against resonance, body trembling when names escape the crack.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final aurora-stopper re-opens the museum’s emptiness by echoing Veyra’s unfinished syllable, instantly reconfiguring absence as active memory. Causality holds—every beat tightens from “she whispered the name” to “the light illuminated loss.” The lens remains accumulative/lyric without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal library’s porous ceilings turn vacancy into pressure; petrified grief shelves become tactile constraints when dew-soaked petals stick to fingertips, narrowing choices to listen or smear. The crack in the chime is a micro-setting that reweights meaning in the final image, the fracture glistening like a mouth of ghosts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“preserve sound without restoring life”—tightens with each ghost-light bloom that charges the museum’s emptiness and forbears any resurrection. One decisive deepening: the caretaker’s renunciation transforms rescue into curation, decisively narrowing options when she mouths the last syllable into fracture-light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“To preserve the sound of forgotten names” emerges from the caretaker’s exact refusal to shout louder; it’s never stated, only embodied. Subtext lurks in her gentle sway against chime—gesture and silence imply stewardship of loss, rendering the theme an earned artifact, not an imposed thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice coils around sensory synesthesia (“foxglove regret,” “spider-silk skylight”) and rhythmic compression—short breath-variations match the wind’s sigh. No head-hopping; the caretaker’s stepped, pearlescent floor echoes become her perceptual compass, and interior monologue bonds her grandmother’s warnings to present fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in two-beat window when crack must fracture once in air then fracture again in final image. Figurative imbroglio like “spectral and foxglove regret-hued light” is controlled by sense—color manifests as the cost of naming, so no muddle in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—museum of extinct feelings as curated absence—feels fresh because the caretaker herself is the last artifact, not a curator. The cracked chime’s imperfection-aperture is a non-obvious frame that reweights every ghost-name into light, despite the late introduction of the bamboo tube.</comment>
