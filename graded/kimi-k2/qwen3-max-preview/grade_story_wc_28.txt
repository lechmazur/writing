<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the bite of the tessera, the micro-choice to press it into the magistrate’s palm all embody her contradiction between mercy and justice. The “retrocognitively trapped” trait is dramatized through embodied action, not label. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts the past walking beside her, foreclosing denial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s meaning is renamed, the magistrate’s whispered memory is the pivot, and the cost is the irreversible loss of the old mercy. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of renaming tightens until the final communal act. Transitions are legible; mosaic shards accumulate pressure. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ancient plaza, ash, fractured arches, and the tessera itself function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the plaza’s wounds dictate where Elira kneels, the tessera’s edge bites her palm. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices glaze and fracture because they matter to her mission. Final image of survivors stepping forward recharges the setting with purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redefining mercy—tightens through each renaming beat. Escalation is accumulative: each tessera taken and renamed raises the communal cost of refusal. Magistrate’s demand for silence creates the single pressure point; Elira’s non-violent counter forces his whispered memory, foreclosing old order.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: every renamed word is earned by a survivor’s loss. Subtext operates in the magistrate’s trembling hand—his daughter’s laughter is the unspoken indictment of prior mercy. Final communal act offers resonant, non-moralizing answer: mercy is practice, not plea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical but grounded: “ash clung like powdered grief,” “mercy must break doors.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short imperative bursts at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elira. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual; magistrate’s single whisper carries weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“tessera,” “retrocognitively”) fits Elira’s reflective intensity. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor purple flourish in “doctrine’s heavy robes” but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—mercy as active, steel-wielding force—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of ruins into “cradle unbroken” is specific to this voice and moment. Risky lyric structure pays off: communal renaming scene could have slid into sermon, but stays grounded in individual voices.</comment>
