<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the painter’s contradictory impulses (solitude vs outreach) remain active in scene. Motivation is clear and escalates from private ritual to communal act. The final gesture—accepting the girl—earns a credible renunciation of isolation with visible cost. Minor drift into abstract “kindness” labels keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the painter’s stance shifts from solitary transmitter to mentor, crystallized in the wordless invitation. Causal chain (glyph → barista → note → girl) is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the shared silence and the handing-over of the ritual. One transition (girl’s arrival) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse, smog, moonlight, and brush form a micro-setting that constrains every stroke and breath. Soot-streaked glass and meteorite ink are tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene. The moon’s path literally guides canvas placement, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving encoded kindness can awaken empathy—is signaled early and tightened through each glyph’s ripple effect. Escalation is accumulative: each painting widens the circle of influence. The final beat forces a choice: keep the ritual private or share it. Cost is felt in the loss of sole authorship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the painter’s actions: memory and kindness survive linguistic extinction. Subtext lives in the brush’s whisper and the strangers’ offerings. Final image of two figures painting under moonlight reweights the premise—empathy is not solitary. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a painter’s perceptual signature—colors, textures, lunar angles. Syntax modulates with ritual pacing; no head-hopping. Distinct diction (“saffron quiet,” “moon-tipped brush”) remains consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final shared silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers pigment, scent, or resonance. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“silence pooled like spilled ink”). No loops or scaffold. Minor risk of overwriting in “ghosts of scribes” line, but rhythm justifies it. Closure line is clean and unadorned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses extinct languages, lunar calligraphy, and urban empathy into a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode sustains momentum without gimmickry. Specificity of Vaelish and Sky-Weaver glyphs anchors universals. Final reprise of glyph on a billboard feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
