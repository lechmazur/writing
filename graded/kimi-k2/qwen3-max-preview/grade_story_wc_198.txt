<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied grief; the saxophonist’s micro-choices (softened embouchure, letting notes dissolve) foreclose fame and forestall prophecy with felt cost. Motivation is consistent and intensifies through the final breath. The absence of secondary characters limits relationship crucible, but single-POV depth compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the prism’s silent shatter reconfigures meaning and stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (prophecy → cipher → song → silence) is tight; no orientation drift. The final dewdrop crystallizes the before/after without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, saxophone, and prism constrain every tactic; grotto walls pulse in rhythm, prism scatters light that the melody drains. Sensory economy is purposeful—dewdrops as lenses, moss as breath. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing a prophecy—tightens via each phrase; agency is exercised through renunciation of volume. One meaningful deepening: the hush thickens until even dripping water pauses. Cost is visible in the shattering prism and the saxophonist’s vanishing exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between sound and silence, beauty and erasure. Final image of the lone dewdrop reweights the entire premise: some silences must never be broken. No moralizing; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed lyricism with tactile specificity (“brass muted by the damp”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the saxophonist’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final whisper is cadence-perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise (“curling like smoke around silence”) and internally consistent. High information density without overwriting; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecy-silencing jazz ritual inside a living grotto. Tropes (fog, prophecy, prism) are transformed through sensory specificity and causal integration. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
