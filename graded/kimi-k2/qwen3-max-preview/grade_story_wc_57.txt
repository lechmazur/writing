<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent; the collector’s shift from seed-gathering to “collecting hands” is earned through patient mimicry and tactile learning. Havel’s gnarled driftwood fingers and rasping voice give him weight without cliché. The only drag is the slightly over-articulated “I’m collecting hands,” which edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: her request → his teaching → her embodied mastery. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she leaves with rope-coiled knowledge and a promise, the cost being the time and humility paid in snow. Orientation is crisp by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and tarred hemp are filtered through the collector’s soil-stained gloves; each detail constrains posture and attention. The fulgurite glint in the final shaft of sun recharges the storm-memory motif. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preservation of living craft. Pressure tightens as silence and snow accumulate; the “storm’s eye” knot becomes the decisive micro-turn that crystallizes readiness. Cost is the collector’s prior certainty—she now carries the rope’s weight, not just seeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gesture and fiber: memory is not stored but braided. The final image—rope coiled “like a sleeping serpent of wisdom”—reweights the fulgurite’s violence into patient continuity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the fog.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside the collector’s perceptual bias—snowflakes, salt-sting, rope tension. Havel’s dialogue is spare, weathered, distinct. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic, propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Occasional lyrical flourish (“sky’s broken tooth”) is earned by context. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the oceanic hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor trope is inverted: the apprentice offers the gift (fulgurite) and the elder accepts only after testing her hands. Knot-language feels newly minted, not folkloric pastiche. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no storm, only fog—and it pays off.</comment>
