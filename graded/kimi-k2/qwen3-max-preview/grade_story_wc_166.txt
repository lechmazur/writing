<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied in lunar pulse and bleeding soles; the contradiction between outlawed memory and bodily inscription drives every micro-choice. The final “to fledge” stance is earned by cumulative sacrifice—salt, sweat, blood—foreclosing return to the ban. Only the villagers’ sudden appearance feels slightly under-motivated, shaving the top tenth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dance completes the cosmic verse on her skin, turning exile into compass. Causality holds—each beat of motion is because/therefore linked to the moonstone’s resonance and the ban’s pressure. Cost is legible in torn feet and permanent asterisk. Track A single-scene default is cleanly met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden’s velvet hush and dew-laced moss act as micro-setting that constrains movement—no walls, no clocks, only tidal pull. Spatial choreography is exact: barefoot spirals, petals leaning in. The moonstone speck fuses to skin, becoming setting-as-constraint. Slight deduction for generic “constellations aligning.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory versus erasure—tightens through each choreographic beat; the nostalgia ban’s pressure grows as her body becomes parchment. One decisive deepening: moonstone speck re-ignites banned lullabies, forcing the final inscription. Cost is visible in bleeding moss and tremoring muscles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the body’s refusal to forget; no explicit thesis, only the obsidian grace of scars as text. Subtext lives in silence between villagers’ wildflowers and her open palm. Final image—child’s dandelion clock—reweights exile from isolation to transmission without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is tidal, syntactically swelling and ebbing with lunar cadence. Perceptual signature—“gravitational sighs and stellar sighs”—is character-bound and consistent. No head-hopping; even the child’s whisper is filtered through her ear. Rhythm modulates under fatigue without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cosmic verse on mortal skin”) risks register drift but is earned by mythic stakes. One mixed metaphor—“velvet hush of petals folding”—keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: outlawed nostalgia + tide-dancer physiology + body-as-manuscript. Moonstone speck as memory fragment is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off; the story commits fully to its conceit without gimmickry.</comment>
