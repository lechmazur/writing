<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—burned spy seeking redemption vs. gardener of justice—are embodied in the trembling hand that both hides and plants the microfilm. The final renunciation of retrieval for legacy is earned by the prior causal chain of betrayal and the embodied cost of her burns. Interiority is concrete and specific; no stock phrases intrude. One slip: the phrase “ghost of justice” edges toward abstraction rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the act of planting truth reweights the entire premise—survival becomes legacy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of snow-ciphers and rust imagery tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no drift. Cost is legible in the empty pillbox left to rust—“it would rust…that was the point.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, and tilted earth constrain every tactical choice—wind shifts dictate footholds, thaw dictates burial depth. The engraved pillbox becomes micro-setting that charges the final image when its etchings catch the last light. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a spy notices wind veils and antenna angles. One minor redundancy: “zephyr bluff in mist” repeats in opening and closing without new inflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—legacy vs. survival—tightens through the deepening choice to bury rather than retrieve. The prudently daring trait forces micro-choices: testing footholds, calculating wind, choosing silence over handlers. Cost is visible in the emptied pillbox and the literal burn scars. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: justice as compost, truth as seed. The final image of the pillbox rusting into the bluff’s bones reweights all prior betrayal without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the trembling hand, the silver hush—never in thesis. The motif of “unused courage” is redefined from weapon to legacy in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors the protagonist’s cautious ascent—“not reckless, not timid.” Perceptual signature is spy-specific: coordinates etched in silver, antenna “crooked like a broken promise.” No head-hopping; POV remains tight. The final cadence—“disappeared…into the turning of the world”—earns its elevation through prior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every image advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh—“snowdrifts shaped by seasonal winds”—and never mixed. One minor loop: “rust on the blade” / “rusted hatch” repeats the rust motif within two sentences without new inflection. Otherwise zero scaffold or redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The burned-spy-planting-truth premise is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes are transformed: the pillbox is not a MacGuffin but a burial vessel; the bluff is not a vantage but a grave. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—“coordinates only she could decipher”—grounds the concept in lived detail.</comment>
