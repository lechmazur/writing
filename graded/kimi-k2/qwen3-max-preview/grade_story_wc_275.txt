<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist stance and embodied micro-choices (sheathing the knife, gifting cuttings) are vivid and consistent; the final beat with the child crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but the “senselessly perceptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized in scene. Relationships remain off-stage, so status crucible is N/A. Closure choice is earned and renunciatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard layers ballast cloth, knife-sheathing ritual, and plant-gifting until the final image reweights continuity as quiet resistance. Orientation is immediate; transitions are legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s stance crystallized with felt cost in the girl’s departure. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass dome, red soil, and ballast scrap are selective, tactile, and return in the final gift; the dome’s refracted light charges the last image. Spatial anchors are clear; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting (planter lined with scrap) constrains the ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus despair—tightens through each gift of rooted memory; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is accretive: each visitor tests the vow of gentleness. Cost is visible in the knife’s unused edge and the rationed water. One deepening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuity through quiet cultivation emerges from concrete acts, never sermon. Subtext in the locket, ballast cloth, and rusted locket reweights loss into living memory. Final image of dirt under nails offers non-literal answer. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature—“tremor in a petal before wind arrived.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with ritual pacing. Dialogue sparse but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors (“secret whispered against the sky”) are purposeful and coherent. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm mirrors ritual calm. Occasional elevated diction fits Elara’s meditative stance. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic garden trope is transformed through Elara’s refusal to hunt and the ballast-cloth continuity ritual. Specificity of bounty-hunter lineage versus pacifist practice feels inevitable. Risk in quiet ending pays off via Charged Poise. No derivative drift.</comment>
