<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. reverent listening—surface in embodied micro-choices (gripping throttle, cradling arrow). The final renunciation of “fixing” is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost: she commits to return each inversion, foreclosing other missions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: arrow fused to Grandmother bark reconfigures the orchard’s song and Elira’s purpose. Causal chain (arrow → vines → pulse → planet-wide harmony) is tight; felt cost is the perpetual obligation to listen. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, inverted dew-trails, and the Grandmother Canopy actively constrain flight paths and final placement of the arrow. Sensory hierarchy (scent of nectar, humming bark) is filtered through pilot priorities; environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding resilience—tightens when arrow’s resonance forces a choice: exploit or commune. One meaningful deepening: discovery that resilience is memory, not biology. Cost is the open-ended commitment to echo with the orchard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as resilience. Subtext in “whirling silence” and arrow’s thrumming avoids moralizing. Final image of fused arrow reweights prior material without explicit statement, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—liquid memory, sky-groves, corkscrew vapor—sustained under pressure. No dialogue; perceptual signature remains consistent. Compression (“She wept. Not from awe. From recognition.”) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density lines (“vines erupted…blooming instant orchids”) advance plot and atmosphere simultaneously. Metaphors stay coherent; rhythm modulates with gravity inversion. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—orchard planet with capricious gravity and memory-anchoring arrows—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (arrow as seed, dew-trail navigation) transforms familiar eco-SF tropes. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
