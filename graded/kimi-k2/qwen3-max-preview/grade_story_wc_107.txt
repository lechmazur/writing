<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“molten silica just before it finds its final shape”), but the arc is more symbolic than causal; the glassblower’s renunciation is felt yet not driven by contradictory impulses in scene. Motivation is consistent, but the cost is poetic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spheres and bookmark crystallize a before/after of abandonment and invitation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each beat deepens the pattern of renunciation—held cleanly to the final image with visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and selective (“brittle air… rusted dials… slush-laden streets”), anchoring early. The control room and melting ice constrain the ritual and charge the final image; the spheres refract the thaw, making environment integral to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—abandoning control to craft safe inquiry—is signaled early and tightens through each sphere placed. The deepening is a cadence shift from sweeping to sealing the bookmark; cost is felt in the irreversible exit, not in higher jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of thawing assumptions emerges organically from glass, ice, and silence; the final image reweights the bookmark as “fossilized prayer” without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and light invites reflection without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature—glassblower’s furnace-eye view—and rhythmic control that modulates with heat and cold. No head-hopping; narration stays within her sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Minor loop risk in “drip-drip-drip” and “thoughtfully spirited” refrain, but these serve cadence and do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic salvage with meditative craft feels fresh; the spheres as “refuge for questions” is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in quiet lyric closure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
