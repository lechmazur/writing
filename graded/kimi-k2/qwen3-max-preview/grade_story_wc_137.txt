<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s skeptical kindness is embodied in her tactile handling of the tile and her refusal to force a solution; the interior contradiction between doubt and wonder drives every micro-choice and is paid for in the quiet cost of leaving the mystery unresolved yet shared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each remembered echo layers density until the final “score” crystallizes the stake; the closure is a Charged Poise where the cost is the unspoken solitude she accepts by archiving the unheard symphony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower’s salt wind and whale-song are not backdrop but active forces that vibrate through stone and tile, constraining her posture and pacing; the velvet dais and brass instruments ground the micro-setting and charge the final image of moonlit waves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to honor entangled memory without claiming it—tightens as each harmonic memory raises the ethical cost of appropriation; her renunciation to archive rather than possess is an earned narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the quiet refusal to extract meaning: memory is not property but shared resonance; the final parchment-tied-with-sea-grass reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving the reader in charged silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person limited voice is consistent, with rhythmic control that syncs sentence pulse to whale-call cadence; perceptual signature is sharp—she notices salt crust on brass, not constellations, grounding the skeptic’s gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “salt winds that carried the distant songs” does triple sensory work; no loops or scaffold, and the metaphor of the tile “breathing” is precise, not purple, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of whale-song, star-maps, and empathic archaeology feels inevitable; the magic-square-as-conduit rather than spellbook subverts genre expectation, and the unheard symphony motif is a fresh, non-obvious angle on memory.</comment>
