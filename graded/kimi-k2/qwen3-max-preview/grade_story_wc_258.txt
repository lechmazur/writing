<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the cartomancer’s curiosity is dramatized through tactile ritual. Yet no internal contradiction or visible cost charges the final beat—her stance merely crystallizes. Secondary pressure from the visitor is too brief to test her values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map pinned to the wall reconfigures the cultural future without overt triumph. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each measured card adds density until the pattern becomes undeniable. The final invitation to the visitor tightens the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and ink-stained fingers anchor place and body early. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining how meaning is quantified. Weather and loft details filter through the POV’s obsessional noticing, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering emergent cultural grammar—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure deepens via accumulating evidence (phoenix stencil, chalk equations) but never narrows options; the cartomancer’s agency is observational, not confrontational. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: post-collapse societies recompose through shared symbols rather than capital. Subtext hums in the silence after algorithms “once screamed.” Final line “remembering forward” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control and sensory specificity. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—“liquid runes,” “dormant serpent”—sustains tone under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Minor scaffold: “steady, like the drip of rain” repeats the earlier rain motif without new pressure. Otherwise clean, vivid, and free of loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cartomancy with cultural forensics in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. QR-code phoenix and #FeedTheFuture equations feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
