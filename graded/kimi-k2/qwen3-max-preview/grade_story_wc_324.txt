<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tracer’s interiority is embodied in her sensory attunement to “syncopated ache” and her micro-choice to kneel, tune, and extend a steadying hand. Contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. the knowledge that “unanswered echoes fester”—drive every beat. The girl’s vulnerability is rendered through gesture rather than label, and the tracer’s final act of walking her out is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the girl’s stance shifts from frozen waiting to walking away, the tracer’s choice to broadcast warmth forecloses her solitary path. Causal linkage holds—photograph summons, hearing-aid pulse guides, assurance re-tunes the echo. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by marble, mist, and twilight; no drift occurs. Cost is legible in the tracer’s damp knees and the photograph now “calm,” its duty discharged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium is not mere backdrop: condensation drips onto the photograph, marble veins echo histories, and the cracked fountain’s lilies become surrendered hands that cue the tracer’s kneel. The hearing-aid’s brass casing and dead battery function as micro-setting that constrains her method. Spatial choreography is clean—planter, colonnade, exit—tracking bodies and objects without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescuing a stranded child’s memory—tightens when the pulse flutters “like wings against glass.” One decisive deepening: the tracer chooses to broadcast a counter-pulse rather than merely trace, narrowing her options from observer to participant. Cost is the emotional toll of telling the girl “they’re not coming back,” paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: love’s persistence beyond death is dramatized through the photograph’s vibration and the tracer’s re-tuning, not stated. Subtext resides in the girl’s silent tears and synchronized heartbeat. The final image—two figures walking toward glowing exit—offers a non-literal answer: love changes frequency, not existence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“bruised twilight,” “falling ash”—with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to urgency. POV remains tightly focalized through the tracer; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: she notices emotional frequencies, not décor. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual—“It’s yours, isn’t it?”—carrying more in silence than speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. No loops or scaffold; “syncopated ache” and “liquid gold puddles” serve immediate pressure. Grammar and tense are flawless; spatial tracking is transparent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh, non-gimmick reframing of psychic medium tropes, grounded in tactile procedure. The decades-old hearing aid as emotional Geiger counter feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final image crystallizes without exposition. Transformation test passed—plot and arc could not survive renaming.</comment>
