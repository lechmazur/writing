<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the inspector’s contradictory impulses (duty vs. longing) play out in micro-choices like pressing the pearl into the shell. The final renunciation—becoming conduit rather than owner—earns its cost through prior confessions. Minor slip: “envied the dead their release” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl dissolves into her, caves glow, walls between hearts dissolve—felt cost is the emptied shell and vanished pearl. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each confession layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain movement and acoustics; the nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that literally holds the stakes. Final image recharges the cave’s glow, tying environment to transformation. Selective sensory detail (salt-crusted shale, trembling halos) never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing isolation via pearl activation—tightens with each confession; the harmonic vibration marks the decisive intensification. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is the emptied shell and irreversible internalization of others’ hopes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-through-vulnerability emerges organically from the ritual; no explicit moralizing. Final image of glowing caves and self offers non-literal answer: isolation dissolves when hope is mirrored back. Subtext operates in silence after the last confession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the inspector’s tactile awe. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate. Compression (“Time here wasn’t measured in minutes…”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual freight (action + atmosphere). Metaphors are coherent—“cathedral of compression” reweights despair into radiance. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for awe, clipped for confession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic bunker inspector meets mythic pearl ritual without genre cliché. Specificity of “Bureau of Emotional Contingencies” grounds the fantastical. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
