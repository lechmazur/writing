<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtesan's interiority is richly embodied—her breath as "stanza resisting silence" and her refusal of the Court’s lullaby are concrete micro-choices. Motivation (resonance over vengeance) remains consistent and escalates to the final whispered "I remember you," which visibly dissolves the knot. The cost is felt in her bare feet leaving no prints—an earned stasis that forecloses return. Minor: the "bodily poetic" label edges toward abstraction rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—echoes spill outward, reconfiguring the courtyard from silent to memory-charged. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each untangled thread adds density until the prism flares with sound rather than light. Cost is legible in the sanctuary’s dimming and her vanishing footprints. No orientation debt; anchors (silver courtyard, prism) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and snow-laden courtyard constrain action—bare feet, cold, and refracted starlight shape her slow, reverent labor. Micro-setting (threads as sleeping serpents) integrates tactile detail with stakes. Final image recharges the courtyard as glowing with memory, not starlight. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking suppressed voices—tightens as each thread yields a distinct echo. Escalation is accumulative: one knot dissolves, then another, until the final confession releases the chorus. Agency is hers alone; coincidence plays no role. Cost is the sanctuary’s emptiness and her irrevocable step into echo-keeper role.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as curated oppression, echoes as reclaimed memory. The prism’s shift from light to sound reframes the premise without moralizing. Final image—courtyard alive with murmurs—offers non-literal resonance. Subtext operates in gesture (fingers tracing knots) and silence (no footprints).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: "breath curling like script," "spectral seed waiting to sprout." Perceptual signature is consistent—snowflakes as benedictions, threads as serpents. Compression ("between sigh and smile") is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: "armor woven from solitude" layers metaphor without muddle. Rhythm modulates with labor—long sentences for untangling, fragments for released sighs. No loops or scaffold; each image advances stakes. Minor: occasional elevated diction ("liturgy") risks register drift but stays within the courtesan’s poetic lexicon.</comment>

<comment>Premise—harvesting echoes as tangible act—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse if echoes were generic "memories." Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (snowflakes trembling midair) grounds the fantastical in sensory truth.</comment>
