<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“serene upheaval humming in her marrow”), but the dreamer’s contradictory impulses remain largely implicit; the final choice to “begin again” is credible yet feels more iterative than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the obsidian disc triggers a resonance cascade that reconfigures timelines with visible cost (child laughs, ceasefire holds). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of create-launch-recalibrate tightens stakes without causal rupture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto’s tide, salt crystals, and bioluminescent anemones constrain placement of patterns and gauge; obsidian disc’s warmth and harmonics charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping hope’s architecture soluble—is signaled early and escalates through each pattern and balloon; the silver balloon’s return tightens options by 0.7 degrees. Cost is felt in the dreamer’s relentless iteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as a structure of variables, grief transmuted into lift. Final image of the multiverse exhaling offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the dreamer’s logical lens. No head-hopping; diction stays within lexicon of equations and tides.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (silk scarves, slow fireworks) are controlled and purposeful; rhythm accelerates with pressure. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hope as iterative equation, trial balloons as speculative probes, grotto as timeline nexus. Risky lyric structure pays off; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
