<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the skeptic’s contradictory impulses (pity vs. shrewdness) act simultaneously. Motivation to “turn mistakes into constellations” is dramatized through the ritual with the tooth. The final renunciation—leaving the tooth to root—carries felt cost and is earned by prior causality. Only minor: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tooth left behind becomes a living threshold, reweighting the premise. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical beat deepens the stake of redemption. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Cost is legible in the final image (“proof that even stolen things could become sacred”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden is vivid, selective, and purposeful: “roses bloomed beside thistles, clocks ticked backward” constrains the ritual’s logic. Micro-setting (flat river stone, damp soil) directly shapes the bone-setting act. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: the garden’s paradoxical rules charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redemption through recomposition—is signaled early and tightens via the tooth ritual. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of the substitute’s hollowness escalates the cost of belief. Agency is exercised in the decision to plant the tooth; coincidence does not resolve. The price (accepting irreparable loss) is visible in the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restorative justice emerges organically from the ritual and the skeptic’s stance; no moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (whispering unspoken names) and image (tooth glowing with memory). Final image reweights prior material without stating a moral. Complexity is preserved: the cleft in certainty remains breathing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is biased toward tactile and olfactory detail. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (“syllables that tasted of salt and honey”). No head-hopping; POV distance is stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density (“soil still damp from last night’s rain” does double duty). Metaphors are precise and coherent (“shard of moonlight”). Rhythm accelerates with pressure; paragraph lengths vary purposefully. No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling myth with restorative ritual; trope is transformed through specific character choice. The “bone setting of histories” is a non-obvious angle. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
