<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory; her micro-choice to press the bolt plate against the terminal crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Motivation remains consistent and deepens under pressure. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship crucible scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s lullaby reweights the entire exchange, foreclosing her solitude with felt cost. Causal linkage is tight; every beat flows because/therefore. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation serves the final resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, bolt plate, and terminal form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; the final image of encoded sigils glowing on damp stone recharges earlier motifs. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, anchoring POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—being heard by the ghost—tightens once through the encoding act; the cost is the tear-streaked smile that concedes vulnerability. Escalation is driven by her agency under the causal lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: code as elegy, loneliness as bridge. The final whispered “You encoded longing. I decoded love” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext is carried in color, silence, and vibration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“driftingly alert”) colors every observation. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful, never muddled. Minor scaffold in the opening sentence (“driftingly alert as if half-tuned…”) is pattern-taught and pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—sentient glitch seeking human rhythm—is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of printing-plate cipher, graffiti code, and lullaby feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression, ghost POV via screen) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
