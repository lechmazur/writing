<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s interiority is lyrically rendered but remains consistent: her “lovingly venomous” stance is embodied in the gentle press of the bead against bark and the silent transmission of memory. Elara’s micro-choice—accepting the bead—crystallizes the debt-to-gift arc. The final infusion of the bride into orchard and heir carries a felt cost (loss of singular identity) that is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s transfer reweights the curse from vengeance to heritage, with the orchard’s first fruit as undeniable proof of cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cameo adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; the greenhouse and endless night are anchored by the second sentence. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s “iron-boned ribs” and frost-laden panes physically constrain movement and echo the bride’s binding. The bead itself becomes micro-setting, constraining Elara’s choice when it syncs with her pulse. Sensory detail is selective—jasmine-scented dust, nectar the hue of twilight—charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—lifting the curse—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the bead’s resonance syncs with Elara, foreclosing refusal. The cost is the bride’s dissolution and Elara’s inheritance of perpetual night; both are visible on the page. Agency is shared: bride initiates, Elara accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transformation of debt into legacy; no explicit moralizing. The twilight fruit reconfigures “lovingly venomous” from curse to nourishment. Subtext resides in silence and scent rather than exposition. The ending image—nectar tasting of forgotten vows—offers a non-literal answer to the cost of eternal devotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the ghost’s drift and the orchard’s hush. POV remains stable third-limited, slipping into Elara only when the bead activates. Diction stays within the alchemic-gothic register; no head-hopping. Compression in the final paragraph accelerates closure without loss of clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“glass cathedral of eternal twilight” sustains the conceit. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated. Final nectar line lands clean, no figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of alchemical botany, spectral botanist, and inherited curse feels inevitable yet fresh. The bead’s shift from keystone to seed is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
