<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"calloused fingers tracing the cool curve"—but the glazier’s contradictory impulses remain largely implicit; the final act of carrying the prism to Widow Hargrove crystallizes his stance with visible cost, yet the father memory feels slightly grafted rather than organically earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glazier’s decision to consecrate the mundane reframes the entire morning’s ritual. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each ring and refraction layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Causality holds cleanly from stone-drop to prism-cradle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay’s mist, tide pool, and prism-light are filtered through the glazier’s selective attention; the environment constrains his ritual and charges the final image when the prism refracts dawn across wet stone. Spatial choreography is precise—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding sacred geometry in the ordinary—escalates through the stone’s rings and prism’s refraction, tightening until the glazier commits to sharing the vision. Cost is felt in the kneeling protest and the relinquishing of solitary witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glazier’s acts: value is not found but made visible. The final image of spectral shards on cobblestones offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence between splash and fade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, attentive, tactile. Syntax mirrors the glazier’s observational rhythm: long clauses for mist, staccato for droplets. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers texture without loops. Metaphors (“spectral shards that danced”) are precise and earned. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; final paragraph maintains clarity and charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—ritualized attention as consecration—feels fresh through specific lived detail: tide charts, cracked tavern glass, heron hesitation. Synthesis of physics and mysticism is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
