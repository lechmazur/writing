<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the gazer’s recognition of her own unmailed letters crystallizes her motive. Yet the decisive act—gathering the letters to mail—feels slightly under-motivated against her established role as witness rather than courier, blurring the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds; psychometry triggers the discovery, the hidden compartment tightens stakes, and the final release earns a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with felt cost: the theater exhales, the gazer steps into rain carrying the weight of carried grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projection booth, rain, velvet, and rusted canisters are tactile and selective; the film strip itself becomes micro-setting that constrains and charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating and witnessing unused love—escalates from passive reading to active release. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of the oilcloth bundle narrows options from observation to responsibility. Cost is visible in the gazer’s trembling fingers and final burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence and transmutation emerges organically through objects and action. Final image of lanterns on a river offers non-literal, resonant closure without moralizing. Subtext in the unmailed letters deepens the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, textured voice remains consistent; perceptual signature (“loneliness pooling in corners of frames”) is character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly from immersive memory to present release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor filter-verb clusters (“she could feel… she could hear…”) that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors; imagery sustains momentum to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of psychometric archaeology of celluloid grief feels fresh; transformation of forgotten artifacts into living testimony avoids cliché. Specificity of 1947 romance strip and wax-sealed letters anchors originality.</comment>
