<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is vivid—trembling palms, weeping for beauty—but the story withholds any concrete micro-choice under pressure; witnessing is passive, so the arc feels observational rather than earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized; the keeper’s stance is static, softened wax rather than altered by cost. The final smile is resonant yet unmotivated by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper returns altered, “softened like wax,” and the final image of letting truth slip through fingers reconfigures the stake from preservation to release. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of seasons and decay tightens toward silence—yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge’s cool pulse and mirrored quietude actively constrain the keeper’s action—kneeling, touching, stepping into folds—charging the final image. Micro-setting (origami swan, beetle wings in shelves) is tactile and specific, anchoring POV bias. Environment guides choice without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early and reweighted at closure, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by agency; the drift of seasons deepens texture without narrowing options. The keeper’s only “choice” is to return, a renunciation without visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of non-intervention, beauty in impermanence. Subtext lives in gesture—ink released, river murmuring—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights premise without statement: letting truth slip becomes the resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is biased toward synesthetic decay (“moss clinging like forgotten thoughts”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long spirals of clauses, then clipped release. No head-hopping; focalization remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are precise (“eras pooled like ink spilled across parchment”). No loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes cadence. Minor elevated diction (“regenerative silence”) reads intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: entropy as dance partner, archive that celebrates forgetting. Familiar tropes—hidden library, obsidian monolith—are transformed through sensory specificity and non-linear time. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
