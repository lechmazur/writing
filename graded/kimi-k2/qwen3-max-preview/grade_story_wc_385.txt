<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echo-singer’s interiority is concrete and embodied (throat raw, soul lighter), motivations progress from personal question to sacrifice, and the final choice of renunciation (not destroying) is earned. The mute child and harvested entity remain functions more than secondary beings, so relationship/status axes remain undeveloped, but the core arc is driven and credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses to sing rather than destroy, returns resonance to the wind, and forecloses her own silence; cost is visible in raw throat and fulfilled shell. All anchors (who, where, when) are oriented before the ~120-word mark through ritual kneeling and serpentine nexus under starlight. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: intensification of emotional resonance reweights stake without external plot reversals. No structural slips touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment and shell (“whispering seashell half”) function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices and charge the final image; the canyon mouth and twilight cues dictate ritual timbre and resonance harvesting rules. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward sound over visual, reflecting the singer’s vocation; spatial staging stays coherent throughout the kneel-sing-shift. No credence strain; modern realism rules are met because the piece is fabulist but internally consistent. Tone supports grief without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—return stolen emotional resonance—tightens from legend to personal theft once the shell delivers the final layer. One clear escalation: when “progressive disclosure” reveals entity nesting in nexus, stakes narrow from curiosity to life-mission; the final choice crystallizes cost (voice for song). Coincidence (mute child) complicates but does not resolve. No extraneous reversals, pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through the specific: grief’s persistence, resonance-as-life, and the cost of carrying the unheard. Final lullaby reweights the earlier pretty-trick echo into sacred responsibility without moralizing. Subtext dwells in the shell’s salt-crusted silk and the sigh in the willow root—image rather than statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers as earned melancholy. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, cadenced, and wholly fitting to a singer-mystic; diction (“wind-carved hollows,” “veins of silver”) remains character-bound and never becomes purple because the density charges theme. No dialogue appears, so no register clash; interior monologue modulates from trembling to reed-blown lullaby without lapsing into lyric cliché. Perceptual signature—sound over sight, resonance as palpable weight—is maintained to the final sigh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density yet crystal clear; every sentence advances mood, stakes, or sensory layer. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors. Line-level rhythm mirrors singing itself: long sinuous phrases that coil and release. Occasional heightened adjectives stay purposeful under the lyrical frame and never obscure causality at closure. Zero text artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question>
<comment>Synthesis of singer myth, echo-theft, and embodied grief yields a premise that feels inevitable and startling. Risk: lyric accretion could drown plot, yet the piece converts poetic density into pressure itself. Transformation test: swap singer for another mourner and entire resonance engine unravels. No derivative premises; bold quiet ending (renunciation of vengeance) remains rare in quest tropes.</comment>
