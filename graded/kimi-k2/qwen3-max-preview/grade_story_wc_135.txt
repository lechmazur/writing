<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her “salt clinging to her woolen shawl like forgotten prayers” anchors motive. Micro-choices—matching a widow’s melody to the valve, cross-referencing tide logs—show reactive vision in action. The final renunciation (no statues, only spoken names) is earned and carries visible social cost. Interior contradiction is implied but not dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s new rite crystallizes memory into ritual, foreclosing memorial-building. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each shard widens the pattern of absence until the final chord of names. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. A hairline slip: the council’s agreement feels slightly under-motivated on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivory harbor’s fog, gulls, and brine are not backdrop but collaborators—constraining Elira’s methods and charging the final image. Micro-setting (the customs-house attic) functions as crucible. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her archival gaze. One minor drift: “bruised sky” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor absence without erasing it—tightens through each interview and deduction. The final rite is a meaningful deepening that narrows options (no physical memorial). Cost is felt socially but could be sharper on the page; hence not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: absence as geography, memory as compass. Subtext lives in gestures—offerings left on Elira’s desk, the untouched rust on the valve. Final image (“That’s how we learned to sail through silence”) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with salt-stung diction and tidal cadence. Compression (“staggered intervals—sometimes days, sometimes weeks”) teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. One elevated phrase—“cipher—a key to gaps”—slightly lifts register beyond Elira’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers archive, body, and tide. Metaphors are fresh (“tide-silt in estuaries”). No loops or scaffold. A single mixed metaphor—“absences like constellations only she could chart”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—mapping grief via a corroded trumpet valve—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of loss and archive are transformed through Elira’s reactive method. Specificity of pitch-matching and tide logs grounds the concept. Risk in quiet ending pays off.</comment>
