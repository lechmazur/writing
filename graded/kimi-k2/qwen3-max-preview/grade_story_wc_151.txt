<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“aching need” felt in the kneeling posture), yet the single POV never crystallizes a decisive choice on the page; the final stance is more reverie than action, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn ritual reconfigures the meaning of “delivery” with visible cost—ephemeral chalk vs. stamped mail. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, payoff legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden arcade’s brass chutes and marble floor constrain her kneeling posture and chalk ritual; the honeyed light charges the final image of pastel smudges awaiting resurrection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—no message lost again—tightens through the widow’s last words encoded in chalk; cost is the deliberate delay and fragility of rain-washable medium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “meaning hides in margins” emerges through chalked childhood games; final image of dawn light on smudges reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through a postal-archivist lineage, with rhythmic control that modulates from hushed dawn to playful rhymes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density (“hopscotch alphabets, hop-and-dot numerals”) advances both world and stakes; occasional elevated diction (“emotionally calibrated”) fits the archivist voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing playground innocence with adult grief via chalk codes is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
