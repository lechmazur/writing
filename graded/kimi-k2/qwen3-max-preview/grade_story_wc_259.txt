<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the historian’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs. annihilate memory) play out in micro-choices like the off-key humming. The loss-of-child backstory is anchored to present action and tilts her stance. Final renunciation of nostalgia’s hold is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV, causal lens: every beat links because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she releases the motes, foreclosing the comfort of forgetting. Cost is palpable in her bloodied palms and salt-soaked veil. Orientation is clear by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The archive’s fractured dome, bronze prism, and drifting motes are tactile and constrain choice (she must physically touch the pagoda). Twilight’s color shifts mirror internal stakes. Micro-setting (veil, prism) functions as charged object. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: break the cycle of sanitized forgetting. Pressure tightens as nostalgia atoms swarm her; agency is her refusal to follow expected mourning rituals. The humming is the decisive tactic that narrows options and forces release. Cost is felt in physical pain and irreversible release of memories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s poisoned sweetness, the cost of curated silence. Subtext lives in gesture (nails biting palms) and silence (daughter’s unshed tears). Final image of drifting embers reweights the premise without moralizing. Anguished joy is embodied, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to historian’s perceptual signature—dust motes “like trapped fireflies,” bronze facets scattering light “in wrong directions.” Syntax mirrors emotional cadence: long lyrical lines collapse into staccato fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; voice consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Metaphors are precise (“molten regret,” “broken ribs” of shelves). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates during the humming climax then exhales with dust settling. Minor elevated diction is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory atoms as tangible, weaponizable nostalgia—is fresh and fully committed to. The inversion of “purification” as release rather than erasure feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
