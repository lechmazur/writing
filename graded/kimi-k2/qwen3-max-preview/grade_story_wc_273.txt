<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tracker’s interiority is vivid—“quiet, molten fury”—but the final disappearance risks unearned epiphany; cost (vanishing body) is legible yet motivation for total self-erasure remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absolute clarity of lens—Accumulative/Textural, driven by pattern—and closure lands in the disappearing act; the before/after reconfiguration of time-phenomenon and witness is explicit with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved tents, cracked clay, titanium wings anchor space and charge final emptiness; minimalistic objects (ink, drone) are micro-settings that directly constrain choice and disappear in the same motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single tightening beat: discovery of subjective time dilation → deliberate self-erasure under pressure; no redundant reversals, yet agency drives escalation and visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Concept—time slows only for the witness—makes theme of interior refuge vs mockery; ink-fractal mirroring neural collapse gives resonance without thesis-statement drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and perceptually skewed—“raw, pale eyes,” “tingle of ink on temples”—taught early and kept to final dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet precise; no padding, loops, or mixed metaphors. Images like “trembling horizon” and “negative space between moments” earn their place and rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Uncommon synthesis of hard-SF drone + ink-metaphor + trauma-time. Non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; freshness held through closure without gimmick.</comment>
