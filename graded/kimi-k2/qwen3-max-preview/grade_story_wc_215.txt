<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tranquil perception and refusal-to-open crystallize a quiet renunciation; sustained embodiment (kneeling, tracing glass) reveals hierarchy of duty over self. Interiority avoids therapeutic label-speak while sustaining contradictory impulse: serve covenant yet ache for release. Ghost gaze beats (“met her gaze... with gratitude”) validate keeper’s stance—cost paid in eternal charge, not dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A single, continuous accretive arc (mourning → preservation vigil → earned stasis) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a crystallized bow: covenant upheld, yet gratitude redoubles its burden—visible price in final stained-gold glyphs on dust. No orientation debt; spatial timeline stays legible. Tension compresses rather than releases, landing earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scorched dunes + derelict hives provide tactile grit that constrains pacing; beekeeping props (smoker, wax-crusted frames) anchor choices. Final light-splash from stained glass is the setting weaponized against silence—charging the ending, not décor. No world-rule contradictions; sensory focus stays locked to POV attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Single dominant stake: keep covenant vs. desire to unseal grief. Pressure rises through ghost visibility and nightly storms, tightening to the final glance-exchange; no options widen, only deepen in cost. Agency is renunciation; cost is perpetual guardianship. Micro-turn of gratitude reframes burden without resolving it, fulfilling escalation criterion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme (“the architecture of silence”) emerges through embodied ritual, not statement; subtext resides in ghost gestures and withheld murmurs. Final honey-gold glyphs reweight the initial wasteland bleakness, yielding a non-moralizing answer: preservation is love’s bleak form. No thematic echo statements in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lush yet austere syntax mirrors recluse’s muted vigil; rhythmic control avoids lyric clutter. Perceptual signature (noticing grit patterns, humming memory instead of sound) stays coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance locked to single stance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Few loops; sentences advance image, tension, or atmosphere with each pulse. Occasional stacked modifiers “sun-bleached wood, half-buried in ash” teeter on overwriting but remain within POV’s heightened sensory mode and do not cloud closure. No filter-verb stacks in late beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Premise (post-apocalyptic ghost-prioress of failed apiary) avoids cliché via sustained sensory metaphor and ethical complexity. Fresh angle: beekeeper covenant translated to afterlife archive—original without gimmick. Minor deduction for thematic terrain that nods to familiar memento-mourning trope, though specific execution grounds it.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Beat 1: silent choice to kneel nightly. Beat 2: shields glass box in storm, spine as brace. Beat 3: bow acknowledges keeper-master closure. Causal arc: astonished vigil→physical guardianship→earned gratitude. Slight swappability: another quiet ascetic could serve role, but specific bee-hospice devotion is near-irreplaceable. Integration high but not absolute.</grade>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Present at setup beneath fractured roof; functions as sacred tabernacle. Shielding during storm and traced fingertip hum provide second functional beat. Final image: catches dying light, casting honey-gold glyphs—reweights meaning into wordless scripture. Object is integral to covenant symbol, yet conceivably another reliquary could substitute, toning score.</grade>
<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</question><grade>Covenant repeatedly invoked (“binding her to... long after...,” “covenant demanded she hold”). Drives middle choice to never open box and nightly ritual; cost crystallized in final stance. Integration strong, but covenant nature remains slightly abstract rather than concrete rule, limiting ceiling.</grade>
<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</question><grade>Tranquil perception enables decoding of ghosts’ mute semaphore, framing entire observational mode. Trait is embodied—silence read as scripture—but manifests in steady gaze and ritual motion rather than dynamic challenge. Thus pivotal yet subtly static; trait supports rather than pivots stakes.</grade>
<question>9 E</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>Gaze is central: watching ghosts’ “tilt of a spectral shoulder,” then returned ghost gaze in closure. However, gaze functions mainly as receiver, not initiator—it decodes rather than alters outcome mid-scene; reweighting occurs through stance change (bow), not gaze itself. Swappable sensory focal point, slightly dampening score.</grade>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Clue-gathering mechanics taught early (“deciphered... contextual clues”) and sustained through ghost vignettes, shaping which stories remain unspoken. Final moment relies on prior accumulations; method is story engine. Slight abstraction keeps score capped below perfect.</grade>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Wasteland provides bleak canvas that heightens isolation, yet geography itself exerts minimal direct causal force—storms are occasional punctuation, terrain mostly atmospheric. Setting enforces physical decay around relic, supporting theme without altering tactics. Still indispensable atmosphere, limiting higher band.</grade>
<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</question><grade>After ghosts turn visible is the framing time clause, yet temporal momentum remains dream-elastic—no ticking clock or specific countdown pressures choices. Interval is evocative but low-stakes chronology. Time marker serves mood more than engine, limiting integration.</grade>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Purpose drives every nightly choice, from kneel to storm brace to final renunciation. Motive threads through ghosts’ memories, crystallizes in bow: preserve unspoken weight forever. Conflict between desire to unseal and duty to mute is dramatized—cost is visible, making motive essential.</grade>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Tone suffuses every line; quiet eloquence in stillness is maintained through ghost tableaux, breathy wind, bow of wordless thanks. Modulates subtly under storm stress but retains cohesive restraint, reinforcing theme. Could be replaced with another hushed register without structural collapse, albeit with diminished resonance.</grade>
