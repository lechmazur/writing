<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The violinist’s interiority is vivid—her blistered fingers and aching arm embody cost—yet the grandmother’s vanishing remains an unmotivated cipher, slightly thinning the causality of the locust gift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s pulse rekindles, statues kneel, and the violinist walks on—cost paid in dust and juice. Causal chain (soft A → statues freeze → sapling sprouts) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky-bridge, orchard, statues, and locust shell all constrain tactics; the violin’s scarred wood and the single real apple charge the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens via each resonant note; the statues’ spear-lowering marks a visible trade-off. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and the shell’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through husk-to-flight imagery; the final bite of apple reweights “tarnished wonder” without moralizing. Subtext hums in stone dew and root-humming statues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with perceptual signature—“resonantly soft pressure,” “tactile ghost”—never breaks POV; patterned elision (e.g., seven-year silence) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“cold luminescence, metallic tang”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope transformed through husk-as-instrument and statues-as-gardeners; synthesis feels inevitable, risk (soft music vs. stone guards) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
