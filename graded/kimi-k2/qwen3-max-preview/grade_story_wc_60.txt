<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skeptic’s interiority is sharp—her “realistically imaginative” stance is shown through micro-choices like mapping acoustics instead of worshipping ghosts. The final insertion of the key is a credible renunciation of her own detachment, costing her the box’s weight and her observer role. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the shift from skeptic to enabler is asserted more than embodied, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the geese tilt, the city’s silence deepens into “reverence of remembering,” and the oldest fountain sighs—an undeniable reweighting of the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breadcrumb adds density until the final cadence shift. Causality remains lyric rather than sequential, but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Cost is legible in the box’s new lightness and the skeptic’s sidereal witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fountain Twelve’s shattered tile, pigeon droppings, and brass key form a micro-setting that directly constrains the key discovery; the stained glass box functions as mobile setting whose weight and hum guide stance. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—she notices condensation patterns, not tourist landmarks. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. The final “single drop” recharges the entire cityscape without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation of trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the box clicks open, foreclosing the option to remain detached. Pressure grows accumulatively: each breadcrumb increases density until the geese listen and the city’s silence flips from absence to presence. The price is the box’s emptied weight and her transition from observer to midwife. No causal antagonist is needed; the conflict is between forgetting and witnessing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not mystic but material—condensation, brass, lilac—yet its return carries communal grace. The final image of the single drop reprices the entire city from ruin to reverence. Subtext operates in gesture: she closes the box lighter, not triumphant, honoring cost. No moral is declared; the tilted geese are the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to the skeptic’s perceptual signature—“sidereal patience,” “scientific ghost”—with rhythmic control that breathes under pressure. No head-hopping; the city’s people receive only surface impressions consistent with her witness stance. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she noticed condensation patterns”) and never dull immediacy. The final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the city’s inhalation of memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“dry throats choked with moss”—and never clutters the climax. The single drop sentence is crisp, propulsive, and free of scaffold. One near-mixed metaphor (“trapped auroras” inside stained glass) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “realistically imaginative” ghost-hunter who refuses both credulity and dismissal feels fresh; the memory-box as condensation-collector is a novel synthesis. Risk is taken with paused geese and a city that exhales memory—yet the lyric pattern is taught early and lands cleanly. No trope is recycled without transformation: the brass key is not magical but indexical. The concept commits fully, no safety hedging.</comment>
