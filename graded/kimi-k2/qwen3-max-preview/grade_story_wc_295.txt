<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“ink-stained fingers tracing constellations that pulsed like living veins”), motivation rooted in quiet redemption is consistent, and the final renunciation—accepting the burden-chain—earns its cost. The only minor drag is that the guardian’s dialogue slips into explanatory mode, slightly diluting the micro-choice moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronicler’s stance crystallizes into perpetual redistribution of sorrow, cost visible in the covenant with the daylily. Causal lens holds—each beat follows “because/therefore” logic—though the telegram’s arrival is a mild coincidence that complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Observatory glass, star charts, and pressed daylily are tactile anchors that constrain choices (charts guide alignment, telegram triggers departure). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the final image of “meteor showers of mercy” recharges the setting as active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to continue the burden-chain—tightens once the telegram arrives and the guardian’s plea crystallizes the cost. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal, but the narrowing of options is palpable and the price (perpetual service) is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared sorrow emerges organically from star-pulse receipts and the chronicler’s song; no moralizing, only the resonant reweighting that grief becomes grace when redistributed. Final image of “midnight solace” offers non-literal answer without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“syllables that shimmered like dew on petals at midnight”) that escalates under pressure. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the lucid-dream shard.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, character, or pressure. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful; no register drift. High information density—“constellations that pulsed like living veins” does world-building, character, and theme in five words.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of star-worship into star-listening; the burden-receipt premise feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of “variable stars blinked their cryptic morse” anchors the concept; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
