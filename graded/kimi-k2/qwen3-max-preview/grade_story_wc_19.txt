<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The child’s claustrophobia is embodied in trembling ribs and the doll-anchor; interior contradiction (hunger for silence vs. fear of it) drives every beat. Micro-choices—whispering to the doll, climbing upward, letting go—escalate stakes and foreclose return. The final renunciation (falling sideways, not back) is earned by prior longing and costs the safety of walls. Only slight abstraction in “tasted of thunderstorms” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation is immediate (“low ceilings of reinforced steel”). Gravity inversion is the inciting beat; each therefore-link (“so they dreamed… then came the hour…”) tightens toward the hatch breach. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: letting go of fear while clutching the merged doll reweights silence from cage to sustenance. Cost is legible in the irreversible sideways fall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bunker’s metallic drip and “too-close walls” anchor early; the xenial trellis later constrains movement via curling vines. Sensory hierarchy shifts from echoing steel to “gilded hush” that tastes like spun sugar—details filter through the child’s awe. The doll-as-micro-setting evolves from relic to living stitch in the lattice, charging the final image. No spatial drift; every detail pressures choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape curated silence to taste wild silence. Escalation occurs through gravity inversion (external) and the child’s decision to climb rather than retreat (internal). One decisive tightening: the moment they choose to climb higher instead of returning, foreclosing the bunker path. Cost is the irreversible fall through sky-fold; luck complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the child’s embodied struggle: curated silence as starvation vs. wild silence as nourishment. The doll’s sprouting threads literalize gratitude and reweight the bunker’s silence from security to suffocation. Final image—garden where silence tastes of thunderstorms—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (taste, hush, sprout) returns charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is consistent and taught early (“starvation” for silence). Perceptual signature is child-specific: noticing condensation, chipped paint, “silver beads” of droplets. No head-hopping; interiority stays within the child’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from bunker’s clipped dread to trellis’s honeyed elongation, mirroring emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “threads of gold, fine as spider silk” does triple duty (image, motion, metaphor). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s syntactic elongation mirrors the child’s surrender to new silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses bunker dystopia with inverted-gravity pastoral; the synthesis feels inevitable. The “tasting silence” conceit is fresh and grounded in sensory detail. Risk—letting the doll literally merge with sky—pays off emotionally without gimmickry. No stock tropes; every image is particular to this child’s longing.</comment>
