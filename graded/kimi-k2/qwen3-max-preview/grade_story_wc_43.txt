<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s serene vocation and “decisively kind” trait anchor every micro-choice; the broken vinyl functions as embodied memory and tool, but interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene ascent framed as Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Charged Poise where shard dissolves into motes, reconfiguring the haven’s stillness with felt cost—no causal gaps, orientation clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Haven’s scent and cloud-light are tactile constraints that shape hymn acoustics; the vinyl shard’s micro-setting governs the final act, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reunifying presence with peace—tightens through each mundane hymn; agency is renunciation/witness rather than reversal, cost legible in shard’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: brokenness sanctified, not erased. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, resonance carried by scent and sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains a hushed, devotional cadence; perceptual signature filters every detail through hospice-trained attention, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; figurative language is purposeful, no loops. Minor density in “scent of hope” repetitions but never muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice lullaby as afterlife hymnal, broken vinyl as sacrament. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
