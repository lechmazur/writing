<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“humming in her bones”), but the decisive shift from bewilderment to awakening is compressed into a single beat; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: “field to be harvested” reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image (orchard, cameo, bathroom) tightens the pattern without causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is more than postcard; its petals etched with unborn memories and shifting trees constrain perception and later choice. Micro-setting (bathroom) functions as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding nonlinear inheritance—escalates through sensory density and charged objects. One deepening beat in the bathroom crystallizes options; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: gaps in catalogued lives, cameo’s emptiness, petals of unlived selves. Final image reframes inheritance as resonance, not legacy, without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“brightened disquiet”) is consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop (“remembered failing… remembered burning…”) is earned by the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival sci-fi meets metaphysical orchard, bathroom epiphany as structural node. Risky choices heighten stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
