<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “quiet companion folded between folders”), but the decisive shift from cataloguing loss to “magnifying small kindnesses” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully enacted in a visible micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each artifact (button, dust handprint, crayon drawing) tightens the pattern until the final Charged Poise—her new logbook “Magnifications” crystallizes the reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Transitions are seamless and closure lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>File-room micro-setting is tactile and selective; dust motes, slanted light, and shelf shadows constrain how she reads the past. The button as micro-setting object charges the final image and anchors the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming institutional erasure into living memory—escalates through each discovered artifact. One meaningful tightening: the moment she maps dust patterns, options narrow from passive archiving to active memorializing; cost is the emotional exposure of her own unspoken loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “quiet, stubborn love surviving institutional indifference.” Subtext in dust and button avoids moralizing; final image of the button as “compass” offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in archival precision. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (“her breath catching,” “throat tightened”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs without scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“tactfully hopeful curiosity”) stays within archivist’s lexicon. Zero loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—rescuing forgotten foster histories via dust forensics—feels fresh yet inevitable. Button-as-keystone and dust-as-text transform familiar archival grief into specific, lived stakes. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
