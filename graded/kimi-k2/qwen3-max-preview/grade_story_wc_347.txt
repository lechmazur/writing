<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“he hated this duty—not the labor, but the silence”); contradictory impulses (resignation vs refusal to let the chorus grow) play out in micro-choices. The nut-hand-off is a credible renunciation with visible cost: he forfeits his private map and accepts more ghosts. Status dynamics are minimal—only a single line of dialogue—but the caretaker’s voice remains distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he turns back into the frost, path foreclosed, cost legible (“he never did”). Causal chain is tight—because the girl is lost, therefore he assembles guidance, therefore he sacrifices the nut and returns alone. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. Lens holds causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost-feathered branches are vivid, selective, and pressure the route. The nut-as-micro-setting constrains choice and is handled tactically. Sensory hierarchy reflects the caretaker’s fatigue and urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent one more ghost—tightens when the girl appears; the tightening choice (hand over the nut) narrows his own escape options and carries immediate cost. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for length. No reversals beyond the one decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant stewardship emerges through action and image; no moralizing. The final image of frost feathering branches while he sighs “offhandedly exact” reweights the premise: caretaking is endless, unrewarded, yet chosen. Subtext in the nut’s silent transfer carries the cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and character-specific—“offhandedly exact,” “clockwork currents.” Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but voice-distinctive (“Ground’s earned it”). Compression and patterned elision (“he didn’t run. He didn’t shout”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud smooth; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“sun bled orange into violet.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor elevated diction (“viscerally felt”) is consistent with lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clockwork orchard, nut-as-memory-key, and invisible guidance system feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail and character cost. The risk of a quiet, anti-heroic ending heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
