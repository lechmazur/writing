<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific; the vow “to share light without using fire” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—surrendering the shard to communal gaze—carries visible cost (her silence, her knees, her exile) and is earned by the entire accumulative pattern. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, keeping her just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polishing stroke adds density until the final prismatic projection reweights the stake from private vow to communal solace. Closure is a Charged Poise—basin lit, path foreclosed, cost legible in her creaking joints and refusal to speak. Orientation anchors arrive by line 5; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and sea-glass function as micro-setting that constrains every action: damp dictates polishing rhythm, condensation supplies the only light. The shard’s evolving surface tracks time and stakes; its final refraction is inseparable from the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound—salt, moss, mineral—without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—tightens through each polishing beat; the glass’s growing clarity is the visible escalation. One meaningful deepening: when droplets fracture dimness into constellations, the option of private grief is foreclosed; communal witness becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in her bodily surrender and permanent silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of strokes and reflections: stillness as active resistance to consumptive fire. Final image—child cupping “sky”—reweights the pearl motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture and silence; no thematic echo sentences appear. Complexity is preserved: light is shared, yet exile remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a stable psychic distance, tightening to skin-level under friction, widening to mythic only after the shard is surrendered. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long swells, abrupt drip—without losing clarity. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice is unmistakable: “the pearl you form around what the world could not digest.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative layering is purposeful—mist as sleeping dragons—paid off when mist “breathes” at closure. One paraphrase loop (“memories resurfaced” twice in open) prevents 9+. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-to-light arc is transmuted through gem-polishing mechanics and the refusal of fire, yielding a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken with accumulative lyric structure rather than causal reversals; payoff is legible. Specificity of grotto ecology and grandmother’s pearl idiom keeps it from template drift.</comment>
