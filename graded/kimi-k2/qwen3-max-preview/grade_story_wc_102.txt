<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the artist’s breath-counting and trembling hands under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation (“where is unused love stored?”) is consistent and intensifies to the climactic surrender. The pilgrim remains a silhouette, so relationship crucible is absent, but the single POV sustains depth. Final permeation feels earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear unfurls into silver mist that reconfigures the artist’s stance toward love’s reservoir. Causal chain—scent memory → viaduct → obscura image → breath-guided pursuit → kneeling sync—is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is felt in the irreversible permeation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct, bioluminescent vines, and lantern-flowers are vivid, selective, and braided through action. The obscura itself functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and choice. Final image of brighter-blooming viaduct recharges earlier motifs. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightens through breath-guided pursuit. One meaningful deepening: the tear’s unfurling reweights the stake from search to embodied reception. Agency is renunciation/acceptance with visible cost (permeation). Pressure escalates via breath modulation, not external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: unspent love is not stored but sung, a choral dimension between heartbeats. Subtext operates in gesture and silence at the kneeling beat. Final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurrent petals, breath, and tear accumulate meaning that reconfigures at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is camera-obscura inverted and breath-attuned. Syntax modulates with emotional tide—long sentences for twilight drift, shorter fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored. Diction stays within artist’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (petals → faces → mist). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Rhythm mirrors breathing cadence. Minor elevated diction (“spiritually curious”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—pilgrim collecting ungiven love via breath-trail—is fresh synthesis of myth and techne. Transformation test: story collapses without obscura, tear, and breath method. Specificity of jasmine scent and grandmother’s 7-11 count anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
