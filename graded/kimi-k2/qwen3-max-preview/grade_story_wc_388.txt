<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory sorrow-smile at the orchard’s beauty shows simultaneous awe and grief. Micro-choice—pressing the diamond into soil—directly reconfigures stakes and forecloses safety. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies with each discovery. Only minor: competence edges toward too-perfect recall of radiation charts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint radius opens, the plaque reveals a network, and the cost is the lifelong burden of reassembly. Causal chain—letters → diamond → orchard → next coordinates—holds without gaps. Mosaic shards (orchard, embassy safe, future trek) are taught early and converge. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is tactile: irradiated soil crunching, glowing petals, gamma winds. The orchard itself constrains her choice—only here can the diamond activate—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and object states track. Sensory hierarchy mirrors her scientific gaze, narrowing under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate truth despite danger—tightens when the diamond’s true purpose is confirmed and the plaque reveals larger stakes. Escalation is driven by her decision to plant the gem, narrowing her path from lone seeker to network reassembler. Cost is felt: she trades safety for burden. No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as living root that must be dug, not declared. Subtext in the “Stillborn Star” myth—fear weaponized to control scarcity—reverberates without exposition. Final image of the diamond beating like a second heart reweights prior cursed lore into life-giving tool. Complexity lingers: truth hurts, yet refusing it hurts more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: scientific precision braided with lyric sorrow. Syntax mirrors her observant stance—long clauses cataloging data, then abrupt fragments under awe. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Register remains within her plausible lexicon; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line layers sensory data, backstory shard, and forward motion. Metaphors are controlled—“petals drifting like embers”—and never muddle causality. Zero loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates at the diamond activation, then exhales into the final orchard image. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic scavenging with biophysics resonance farming—fresh synthesis. Trope inversion: the “cursed” gem is a life-giver, the orchard is engineered sanctuary. Specific detail—growth rings aligned with storm cycles—anchors the concept. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final heartbeat image.</comment>
