<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and idiosyncratic—her lullaby to headstones, ivy behind cherubs’ wings—but the decisive shift from caretaker to “stitcher of intentions” is slightly under-motivated; the silo’s “call” is poetic yet abstract, so the needle choice feels gifted rather than earned. Still, her embodied grief and micro-gestures (threading her own sleeve-dusk) keep contradiction alive in scene. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of lullabies for the unrest of questions. Just shy of 9 because the causal hinge between sovereign case and needle could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry’s border dissolves into airborne “almosts,” reweighting her prior tidiness into perpetual stewardship of unfinished echoes. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each unraveled thread deepens pattern until the meteoric final image. The sovereign case’s shift from empty to “heavier, humming” is the on-page cost. One micro-turn: lullaby → question. Orientation is taught early (dew-damp grass, cobalt silo by ~100 words). No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cemetery-as-classroom and silo-as-womb are not backdrop but tools: the curved wall literally drinks moonlight, guiding her candle placement and thread visibility. The sovereign case’s brass serpents constrain her thigh-weight and temperature, charging the moment she opens it. Micro-setting (tapestry nailed to warped beam) dictates her bodily posture—kneel, palm, stitch. Selective sensory triage (rust, ivy, candle-blue) mirrors her narrowing focus. Environment directly shapes the final image: meteor through the open crown becomes the stitched “shape of intentions.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep the dead neatly silent or awaken their unfinished voices?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the first thread burns umber beneath her finger. Each decoded knot forecloses the comfort of anonymity; the seafoam strand’s sigh costs her tears and forfeits the lullaby habit. Agency is continuous: she pulls, hums, threads her own dusk-yarn. No external coincidence; pressure is purely accumulative density. Cost is legible (sovereign case grows heavy, silo exhales), but a second tightening beat could push it to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: intentions are not graves to tend but frayed filaments still vibrating. The border’s illegible myth mocks the human hunger for tidy epitaphs; her final whispered questions enact the refusal to seal meaning. Subtext lives in gesture—tucking ivy behind stone wings is revealed as the same impulse that once buried letters or swallowed joy. The meteor streak re-prices the entire night: light is fleeting, therefore stewardship must be ongoing. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a consistent perceptual signature: she hears “liquid twilight,” feels the case “sigh,” sees “colors only felt.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath—long lullaby cadences collapse into needle-punch fragments. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free indirect slips are clean: “she didn’t know why she’d brought it here” stays within her uncertainty. The final shift from humming to whispering is mirrored in sentence rhythm, earning the 9-territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: every metaphor (serpents swallowing tails, tapestry as tangled nerves) recurs and pays off in the closing spiral image. No mixed vehicles; liquid twilight and velvet gloom share aqueous register. One scaffold spot—“she opened it. Inside, no coins. No confessions. Only dust—” could compress, yet the staccato serves breathless reveal. Filter verbs are absent; verbs are kinetic (curled, sighed, whispered). Read-aloud rhythm accelerates down the silo ladder and slows with each stitch. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fuses war relic, embroidery, and cemetery caretaking into an organic conceit; none feel grafted. The “chess clock” metaphor for death is fleeting yet fresh, never reduced to gimmick. Transformation test fails if gardener is swapped—her specific lullaby habit and sleeve-dusk yarn are irreplaceable. Risk distinction: the story dares a lyric, almost static climax (airborne threads) yet lands conceptual cost. No recognizable pop-culture echo. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: graves become looms, intentions become warp.</comment>
