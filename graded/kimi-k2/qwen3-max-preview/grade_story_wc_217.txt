<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is lyrically embodied and consistent; the feather-as-compass anchors her choices without overt exposition. The micro-choice to weave the kite rather than “fix” it crystallizes her values under pressure. Minor: the boy’s interiority is sketched more generically, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patched kite rising “differently” reconfigures the stakes without tidy repair. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each lyrical shard adds density until the final image reweights loss into possibility. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon’s trembling surface and bruised sky constrain mood and mirror internal fracture; the drake feather operates as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One hairline slip: “wet sand” and “wet stone” echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—tightens when the snapped kite threatens to harden grief into permanence. Elira’s act of weaving forecloses the option of full restoration and exacts the cost of visible asymmetry. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the asymmetrical kite’s flight: incompleteness as generative. Subtext resides in gesture—the feather laid atop wreckage—rather than statement. Final whispered line reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic, rhythmic, and controlled; perceptual signature (“salt-cured silence”) is character-specific. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but tonally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors are precise (“bruised sky,” “jubilant ghost”). No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with scene pressure. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she begins to gather”) barely registers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “woven dawns” practice reframes the familiar broken-kite trope into a fresh ethic of asymmetrical repair. Specificity of locale and feather lore prevents template drift. Risk lies in quiet lyricism; it pays off in the final image.</comment>
