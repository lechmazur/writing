<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied; the rosette-touch anchors memory and motive. Her “expectant resignation” is dramatized in the choice to stay and the final invitation. Micro-choice—humming into silence—forecloses retreat and carries felt cost. Only minor drift into gentle abstraction keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer tightens the stake of “will anyone remember?” Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she keeps teaching, renouncing solitude—cost legible in the last maple leaf and the girl’s frayed strap. Orientation crisp by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Velvet library, amber light, and autumn leaves filter every beat through Elara’s selective attention. The rosette and drapes absorb sound, literally constraining the method of “subtracting noise.” Final image—leaf trembling—mirrors the charged poise. Micro-setting (table grain, dust motes) is tactile and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will the last student return? Pressure escalates via silence thickening, footsteps absorbed, leaf about to fall. Agency crystallizes in Elara’s low hum—an act of endurance that risks permanent obscurity. Cost is the acceptance of remaining unheard if no one comes; closure reweights that risk into possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmony as subtraction emerges through concrete rehearsal imagery and the rosette’s silence. Subtext in the girl’s frayed strap and Elara’s “you haven’t learned how to get it wrong” reframes failure as opening. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the hush after the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—velvet, dust, vibration. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her diaphragm, then tightens at the girl’s voice. No head-hopping; dialogue sparse, subtextual. Voice modulation under pressure is precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; metaphors (burnt parchment, single breathing instrument) serve character stakes. Rhythm accelerates in the leaf tremble, then exhales. One paraphrase loop (“expectantly resigned” twice) is minor. No overwriting at climax; final line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor-pupil arc is refreshed by the acoustic metaphor of “subtracting noise” and the zither rosette as silent altar. Specificity of choir practice—twelve-year-olds matching pitch before prejudice—grounds the concept. Quiet risk: ending withholds triumph, choosing weathered stillness.</comment>
