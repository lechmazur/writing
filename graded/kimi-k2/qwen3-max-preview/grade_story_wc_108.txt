<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—“move like fear given legs,” “trembling certainty is my armor”—but the mentor remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation (burning the reel) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Flaws (phobia, hypervigilance) complicate tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: burning the reel crystallizes stance and forecloses revenge. Causal chain—decoding cast → shell whisper → projector fire—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the ember-lit final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rusted library, shell, and reel are tactile, selective, and constrain movement. Micro-setting (splintered floorboards, projector base) guides choices. Final image—embers rising through rusted rafters—recharges the “forgotten stars” motif with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation from mentor’s betrayal—tightens once: decoding the notes forces the burn-or-keep choice. Agency drives escalation; coincidence is absent. Price is the loss of physical proof yet gain of self-definition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: betrayal’s velvet poison, shell’s soft truth. Final whisper—“the softest parts hold the sharpest truths”—reweights premise without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers: is liberation complete or ongoing?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and pressure-responsive: syntax tightens under stress (“knees cracking like dry kindling”). Perceptual signature—fear-filtered attention—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“cursed sensitivity”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar revenge arc is transformed through stunt-double specificity and shell-whisper device. Fresh inflection: liberation via burning evidence rather than exposing it. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
