<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulse to “harvest insights from failure” while honoring the Council’s “Never again” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—leaving the flute as monument—earns its cost through prior causal chain. Only the apprentice’s late question feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the keeper’s refusal to repair the weave reweights the entire premise with visible cost—she becomes “keeper of thresholds,” not relics. Causal lens holds: each driftwood angle, exhaled note, and recorded collapse tightens toward the final stance. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thunder-echo Range’s silence and the lichen-creeping flute constrain the keeper’s tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the amphitheater’s cracked stone and wind memory guide harmonic calibration. Setting evolves from active workspace to silent monument, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor failure without repeating it—tightens through each beat: uncase, breathe, record, renounce. Agency is renunciation with felt cost; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ethics of weaving refracted through three collapsed realms. Final image of offerings left at a silent flute offers non-literal answer—“some doors stay open by staying closed”—without moralizing. Subtext in driftwood arrows and lichen growth is rich.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (“ash-colored sand,” “canyon hush”) stays consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—no muddle in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates during the seam-crossing, then exhales into the final cadence. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of studying collapsed realms via autopsy rather than restoration is fresh and inevitable. Risky structural choice—quiet refusal instead of heroic repair—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of Verdantis, Silmara, Khyren failures grounds universals.</comment>
