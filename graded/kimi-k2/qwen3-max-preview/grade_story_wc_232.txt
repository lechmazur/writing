<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—solitude vs. the vow to his sister—are embodied in his tactile handling of maps and the chip; the final step through the arch costs his lifelong refuge, earned by the sister-memory that has silently steered every micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip’s pulse → ants → hidden door → arch → rewritten present. Closure is a decisive change with unmistakable cost—shop abandoned, identity remapped—delivered in the Lisbon letter on the counter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust-hung shop, phosphorescent cavern, and the creek’s rising murmur all constrain action and mirror Elias’s inner tide; the matrix chip itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem the broken promise—tightens when the arch forces a choice between maps and sister; the creek’s audible rise supplies external pressure, and the price (shop, past life) is on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remapping regret into action emerges from the concrete journey; the Lisbon letter reweights every prior map without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about which life is the margin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, dust-soft, and antique-leaning; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s cartographer’s eye, sustaining lyric compression without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured—"dust-hung quiet," "lodestone pull"—with rhythmic variation that accelerates descent into the cavern; no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar portal-fantasy bones are re-fleshed with map-dealer specificity and ant-oracle logic; the sister-resurrection twist feels inevitable yet fresh, earned by Elias’s lifelong cartography of loss.</comment>
