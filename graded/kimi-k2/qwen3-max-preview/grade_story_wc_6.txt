<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“black sand clings to her knees, gritty and grounding”), but the final “runs toward fire” beat is slightly too compressed to register the full cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the coin’s submersion and the lagoon’s harmonic response crystallize her stance without tidy resolution. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every beat reweights legacy vs. redemption.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Black sand, obsidian lagoon, and copper coin are handled with tactile specificity and return in the final image to constrain her choice; the setting literally sings back at her, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she graft her father’s wild mercy onto her disciplined compassion—tightens once: the coin’s descent forces a public witness and audible cost. Pressure is coherent, no extraneous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the coin, the fire, and the water: scars can sing if given breath. No moralizing; the lagoon’s harmonic ripple is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in firefighter precision (“helmet strapped tight”). Patterned elision (“no sirens, no smoke”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional poetic stacking (“thick as kelp-drift”) is purposeful and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of firefighter procedural, volcanic myth, and elegiac lyric feels inevitable and fresh; the obsidian lagoon as witness is a risk that pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
