<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—grief etched in tactile muscle-memory, guilt embodied in the ruined-village flashback. Motive rings coherent: preserve trust by calibrated silence. One flaw: the village failure, while sharply recalled, is stated retrospectively; a micro-choice within scene would have tightened causality and earned the burden with live weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A Single continuous scene above the clouds lands closure through Charged Poise: final silent-chime reconfigures communal stance with felt cost—she will bear solitude vigilance for others’ sleep. Causal chain holds: tremor → she feels the low-frequency → chime → lanterns blink → trust kept. No Orientation drift, beats advance without lapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arbor as micro-setting (ironwood rail, bioluminescent vines) constrains every move—she strikes the rail with buckle, wind-chimes hum, villagers respond via lantern pulse. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, causally integrated. One wish: single sensory hook from other-than-visual could tighten further.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of communal trust under silence—escalates through one meaningful turn: the tremor that demands chime-not-jump choice. Coincidence is complication, not rescue; cost is isolation she steps toward on sky-bridge. Tension narrows options and charges final image.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Themes of responsible silence and revision emerge from embodied gestures, never stated abstractly. Closure chime re-weights prior motif (buckle, hush) into an understated answer: vigilance is gift and burden. Sentiment stays earned via concrete risk.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice blends lyric compression with tactile precision: “silence shaped into reassurance”, “the wind rose, cool and clean”. Syntax ebbs and flows like breathing. No head-hops; POV locks to Watcher with perceptual signature that notices hush between breezes.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, dense: every line earns space. Rhythm breathes with scene beats—“tap”, “re-clipped”, single clear chime. No loops or scaffold; once mild redundancy “because trust depended on...” could be trimmed but nothing obscures closure clarity.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sky-whale, sideways-rooted trees, wind-chimes carved from branches—specific, non-troped inversions of familiar fantasy elements. Risk remains internal: no spectacle for spectacle’s sake. Fresh angle: the Watcher as guardian of silence rather than knowledge.</question>
