<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied, contradiction-laden interiority is vivid; the kerosene rag knot and mosaic sequence externalize her wager against despair. Motivation intensifies from chant to dance, culminating in the renunciation of the rag—cost paid on the page. One character, one crucible; no relationship pressure needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star’s reappearance reweights the premise, cost is the absorbed rag and the open sky. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each step thickens resonance until the chord cracks the clouds. Orientation is taught by sensory cues; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fortress’s bioluminescent architecture is not backdrop; its petals, vines, and tesserae constrain footfall and supply the harmonic code. Micro-setting (rag, tiles) and macro-setting interlock to shape tactics and charge the final image. Vivid, selective, character-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—tightens through each resonant step; the final chord forces irreversible change. Agency is every footfall; cost is the surrendered rag and the opened sky. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of combustion and silence: hope reclaimed not by spectacle but by listening. The star’s blink reframes prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—laying down the rag—carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is pyrotechnic-poetic, compressed yet precise; chant syntax mirrors chemical ratios. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices temperature shifts and petal-fall, not labels. No head-hopping; lyric elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and pressure. Minor purple tinge in “heaven’s hearth” but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks as prayer encoded in footfall-choreographed mosaic. Risky lyric mode commits fully; payoff is the sound-born star. Specificity of “phosphorescent dust” and “harmonic dissonance” anchors the fantastical.</comment>
