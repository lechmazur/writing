<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s curiosity and engineering mindset are vividly embodied—she measures footfalls, repurposes steam, and sketches questions rather than blueprints. The internal contradiction between stoic observation and creative intervention drives every beat. Her final recalibration of the sextant shows earned endurance with visible cost: she foregoes rest to keep adapting the ruin. One hairline slip: the “new equations for hope” verge on label-speak, though the embodied work mostly redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s “breath” redefines ruin as living system. Causal chain—geothermal rupture → steam redirection → communal return—holds without gaps. The sextant’s final refraction crystallizes the before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terminal’s cracked skylight, ruptured steam line, and kinetic tiles constrain every choice; even the sextant becomes micro-setting atop the spire. Sensory detail is selective—prismatic shards, fogged windows—filtered through Elira’s engineering gaze. Environment actively guides tactics: steam dictates duct paths, footfall energy powers LEDs. One minor drift: “cargo annex” appears only at the end, slightly diluting spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can decay be rechanneled into habitation—tightens when geothermal steam offers either hazard or warmth. Escalation is one deepening: each redirection (steam, light, footfall) raises the cost of failure and widens communal stakes. No external antagonist; pressure is systemic. The felt price is perpetual upkeep—walls still crack, slope persists—visible in the closing image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: entropy redirected into architecture equals hope as process, not destination. The equation H = Σ(ΔI • R) is earned through prior material, not asserted. Subtext lives in gesture—origami birds, traced constellations—inviting reflection without moralizing. Final image of breathing ruin reweights “abandoned” to “adapting.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elira’s perceptual signature—stress fractures read like poetry, light bends around columns. Syntax mirrors her functional creativity: precise, clipped clauses under pressure, then lyrical expanses during reflection. No head-hopping; even crowd murmurs are filtered through her data-collecting stance. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “steam curling like breath against the cold concrete” does triple sensory, metaphorical, and causal work. Rhythm accelerates during welding, slows during skylight refraction. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. One strained simile—“gravity conspires with neglect”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-carnival ruin revived via thermodynamic poetics feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Sextant repurposed for structural angles rather than stars is a specific, irreversible transformation. Risk—quiet communal reclamation instead of spectacle—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; the voice and premise cohere as singular stance.</comment>
