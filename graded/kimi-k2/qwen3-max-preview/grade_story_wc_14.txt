<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stationer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her ear to the lamp, trembling notepad—yet the final choice to leave the book open feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is implied rather than dramatized on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the discovery that the mountain is a chorus reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost; the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the open notepad crystallizes the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and flickering lamp are not mere backdrop; they constrain her posture, supply the hum that refracts history, and charge the final image when the lamp “flickers approvingly.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—ownership of invented pasts—tighten when an alien texture bleeds through; the escalation is one deepening beat, but the cost (shared authorship) is legible only through implication, not on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as collaborative palimpsest. The final image of the open notepad offers a resonant, non-moral answer—history is communal grafting, not solitary archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through her studious sensorium. Patterned elision (“graphite ghosts of eras that never were”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; only minor figurative excess (“incandescent restraint”) edges toward purple. No loops, clean grammar, and the final sentence lands with rhythmic poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—bonsai forests as living archives of fabricated dynasties—is startling yet inevitable; the fluorescent lamp as conduit for communal fictions is a fresh synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
