<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the pacifist’s motives (avoid bloodshed via cunning) drive every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses—rage vs pacifism—co-exist in the same beats. The final renunciation (melody migrates inward) is earned by prior embodied memory work and carries visible cost: the pin stays broken, the box is left behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the melody’s migration reweights the premise. Causality is interior but legible: broken pin → failed release → cellular memory retraining → internalized song. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of the external mechanism. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Soundless sanctuary is rendered through shifting walls, moss floor, and dissolving edges that mirror interior dissolution. The music box functions as micro-setting and constraint; its broken pin alters tactics. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“cold marble,” “jagged metal tooth”). Final image—box on moss—recharges the setting as a reliquary for others’ rage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can she release resentment without violence? Pressure tightens when the box fails; she must retrain her own cells. One decisive deepening: melody migrates inward, foreclosing reliance on external device. Cost is the irreversible loss of the trusted object and the permanent labor of internal maintenance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: pacifism as active, bodily labor rather than passive refusal. Subtext resides in silence, broken metal, and cellular memory. Final image reweights the premise—resentment is not forgiven but metabolized. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the humming marrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic (“thick and suffocating” silence). No dialogue; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak. Patterned elision (“reappears when needed”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops. Metaphors are coherent (ink bleeding into water). No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting: “She turned and walked into the mist, humming.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist strategy reimagined as bodily engineering. Broken music box as pivot rather than MacGuffin. Conceptual risk—cellular memory as literal mechanism—lands because anchored in embodied stakes. Transformation test: story collapses if box is merely fixed or replaced.</comment>
