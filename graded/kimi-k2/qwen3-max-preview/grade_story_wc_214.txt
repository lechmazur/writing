<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the janitor’s shift from cataloger to witness is credibly rooted in prior trauma. The final tearful recognition is earned by the comet’s efflorescence and his sustained micro-choice to keep sweeping. One hairline slip: “called it awakening” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor trace layers density until the rogue comet’s silent bloom delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—stillness as earned stasis. Cost is legible in the unrecorded moment and the janitor’s solitary tears. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s analog dials, wind-chime sensors, and yellow lantern glass form a micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the lantern’s warmth and curve guide the climactic gaze. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to vulnerability—tightens when the unlogged comet appears; the janitor’s choice to observe rather than record forecloses archival certainty. Cost is felt in the archival silence and his solitary tears. One beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges through the comet’s efflorescence and the janitor’s tearful gratitude; no moralizing. The final whispered “Thank you for remembering how to be still” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext in gesture and silence is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—“star-dust whispering against eternity’s quiet” sets cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Lantern glass as lens is a taught pattern that pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers texture without loops. Metaphors are precise—“hymn to impermanence sung in fire and silence.” No overwriting in peak beats; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic janitor as spiritual witness, lantern glass as empathic lens. The comet’s efflorescence into “flourishing stillness” is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
