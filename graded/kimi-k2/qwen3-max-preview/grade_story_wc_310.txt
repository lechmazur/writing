<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor in her molars,” “itch behind her eyes”); motivation evolves from surrender to reclaimed agency. The final choice to step forward without drawing lots is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—she foregoes the safety of chance. Minor drift: the child-vision epiphany feels slightly abstract, but the embodied warmth of the static surge compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she renounces lot-casting and claims agency, cost legible in the drachma’s toss. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of coins, static bursts, and visions tightens into the final image. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One transition (vision flash) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ambered deck, cracked glass, and residual heat constrain her posture and choices; the drachma’s metallic chime charges the final toss. Micro-setting (her body, the coin) functions as setting when it shapes the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Minor: “honeyed light” edges purple but is earned by the amber star motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to surrender to entropy or reclaim agency—tightens when the unbidden vision forces a stance. Escalation is accumulative: each coin, burst, and vision adds pressure until the decisive renunciation. Cost is felt in the “stellar doubt” that softens but remains. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is distilled, not found. The backwards prophecy motif reweights from fatalism to self-authorship without moralizing. Final image—“echo that outlasts the song”—offers resonant, non-literal closure. Avoids thematic echo; insight is embodied in the coin toss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“listening with bone, with breath”) is character-specific. Compression and patterned diction (“cycles,” “static,” “wavelength”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful (“dying pulsar,” “sugar in hot tea”) and never muddles clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor purple in “honeyed air” but contextually earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy, divination, and self-authorship. Backwards prophecy and coin-divination feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of coins (drachma, yuan, doubloon) grounds the cosmic frame.</comment>
