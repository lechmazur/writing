<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s layered memory and atomic skin are embodied in concrete micro-choices (pressing palms to brass, flaring cobalt), but the interior contradiction between mourning and midwifery is more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels slightly unearned given the prior weight of extinction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive re-alignment from mausoleum to loom is on-page, cost is felt in the bodily strain to steady the hum, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal library, brass sundial, and stone-circle hum are not backdrop but active constraints: the sundial’s crooked shadow literally points the next choice, the vapor-flood forces sprint and touch, the hum’s faltering demands bodily sacrifice. Sensory specificity is selective and stakes-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into sovereignty—tightens when the tide floods and the hum stutters; Veyra’s agency (channeling atomic resonance) forecloses the path of passive remembrance and pays a visceral cost (marrow vibration, skin flare).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete re-weighting: extinction’s coordinates shift to genesis without moralizing. The final whispered coordinates of “possible ones” crystallize the thematic arc through image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Veyra’s memory-soaked attention. Patterned elision (“she did not mourn aloud”) is taught early and paid off in the final breath of ozone and possibility.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers memory, sensation, and world-rule without redundancy. Metaphors (library as loom) are coherent and earned, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of extinct-species archivist, cloud-tide library, and brass sundial as navigational tool feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the transformation of echo into genesis is a non-obvious reconfiguration that deepens on reflection.</comment>
