<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vine dresser’s interiority is textured and embodied; her tactile communion with soil and marbles reveals a lived, contradictory stance toward data-driven gardening. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies through the quiet refusal to replant, culminating in an Earned Stasis that costs her institutional standing. The single on-page relationship (with the intern) functions as crucible, forcing her stance crystallization. Minor slip: the “wisely pragmatic” label is stated rather than dramatized in one beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: her refusal to replant forecloses the path of compliance, cost legible in the intern’s retreat and the garden’s wild spiral. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each polished marble layers testimony until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are seamless. One micro-turn (the breeze parting the canopy) tightens the cadence without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden maze is not backdrop but active agent: vines knotting paths, jasmine shivering in recognition, fireflies spiraling in answer. Micro-setting (altar of river stones, cracked marbles) constrains her ritual and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—damp earth scent, warm pulse under palm. Weather and growth patterns evolve causally with her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proof that reciprocity trumps metrics—is signaled early and tightens when the intern delivers the 12 % compliance order. Agency is renunciation: she refuses to replant, paying the cost of bureaucratic censure. Pressure escalates through the lens of Accumulative/Textural testimony; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One clear tightening beat: the intern’s ultimatum forces her public stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: trust and mutual recognition versus quantified control. Subtext resides in gesture—the petal tucked beside marbles, the vine curling like a question mark. The final image of glowing cracks offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is honored; the garden’s “consent” remains ambiguous yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that breathes with scene needs. Distinct perceptual signature—soil memory, frost lullabies—remains consistent. No head-hopping; intern’s dialogue is spare and subtextual. Occasional elevated diction (“commemorate small victories elaborately”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Minor mixed metaphor (“mended deception” as truth reassembled) is brief and coherent. Final cadence shift—fireflies blinking in spirals—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise of measurable luck versus unquantifiable reciprocity feels fresh and specific. Tropes (rebellious gardener, bureaucratic botanist) are transformed through tactile ritual and mutual masquerade with the garden. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
