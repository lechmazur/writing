<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s guilt and vocational shame are embodied in tactile micro-choices (bare feet on tiles, vomiting into surf). The withheld-truth motive intensifies cleanly to the final renunciation. One slip: the “ballast” epiphany edges toward tidy summation rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes from forger to sieve, cost paid by the dissolved carvings and silenced watch. Causal chain holds: because she touches the carving, therefore the memory floods, therefore she redefines her craft. Orientation is swift; driftwood mechanics are taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and tide-worn carvings constrain every beat; the warm, humming wood literally channels memory. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—salt, splinters, ticking—mirroring interior narrowing. Final image of smoothed blank shore recharges the opening bruise-colored tiles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth’s unbearable weight—tightens once: the carving’s revelation forces irrevocable redefinition of self and vocation. Cost is visceral (vomit, dissolved relics, silent watch). No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices and escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the driftwood’s literal function: truth must be sea-tumbled before it can be held. No moralizing; the final image of the blank shore reweights the premise without dictation. Subtext in the father’s softened carving face carries the entire emotional arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“sieved hush,” “salt and bile mingling”—with rhythmic acceleration during the memory flood. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in Elira’s guilt-sharpened attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Occasional lyrical reach (“bruise against the horizon”) stays within POV’s poetic register. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph avoids explanatory drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—shore, driftwood, watch—are transformed through the genealogist’s specific guilt and the “sieved hush” mechanic. The father’s carving revelation feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
