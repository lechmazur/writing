<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the laser button while seeking release—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing, thumbing, offering). The final renunciation is earned by the prior spatial attunement beats and carries visible cost in the dissolution of the familiar stranger. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock therapy-speak intrudes. Only the absence of on-page secondary character pressure keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laser click reweights the button from relic to key, and the stranger’s dissolution reconfigures “letting go” from loss to expansion. Causality is accumulative/textural—each glow-pulse and spatial readout tightens the emotional stakes until the harmonic resonance beat crystallizes the stance. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift. Cost is legible in the final motes sinking into soil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mushroom farm’s bioluminescent pulses act as both sensor array and emotional barometer, constraining Aris’s choices (dimming when intent shifts). Micro-setting—the worn laser button—functions as charged object-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the burnt-sugar scent cue anchors memory without cataloguing. The final image of dust feeding roots reuses setting to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chasing the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightened through each glow-shift and spatial read. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the decisive act is allowing dissolution. Pressure escalates via the mushrooms’ color geometry and the stranger’s softening silhouette. A visible price is paid: the stranger is gone, the diode still dead, the stance irreversibly altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: letting go as expansion, not surrender. Subtext resides in the dead diode that never lights yet unlocks resonance, and in the silent watchers who embody failed release. The final image of motes feeding roots offers a non-literal, conceptually reweighted answer. No moralizing statement intrudes; meaning arises from embodied particulars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited remains tightly anchored to Aris’s spatial perception; no head-hopping. Syntax and diction mirror her calibrated sensorium—precise, tactile, faintly scientific. Compression is purposeful (“thresholds destabilized—not with alarms, but with color shifts”). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, accelerating toward the harmonic beat, then exhaling in the final sentence.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence layers image, character, and world-rule. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“threading,” “swelling,” “folding”) replace modifiers. The burnt-sugar scent and “quiet wildfire” phrase are earned by prior sensory logic. Final paragraph maintains propulsion while opening into resonance.</comment>

<comment>The fusion of quantum mycology and grief-work feels inevitable and fresh. The bioluminescent farm as intrusion-detection medium is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from character need. Transformation test: swapping names or settings would break the specificity of spatial grief. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
