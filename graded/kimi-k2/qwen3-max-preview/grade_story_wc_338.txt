<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the grandmother memory anchors motive without overt exposition. The final act of witness is earned by prior pattern of micro-choices (yarrow sprig, tripod alignment). No contradictory impulses in scene, but the absence of visible cost at closure caps the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chapel silhouette crystallizes meaning with felt cost—she weeps, foregoes excavation, leaves yarrow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of shadow shifts reweights the map’s tear. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vault, henge, and map are tactile constraints that guide camera placement and bodily stance. Condensation droplets and moss narrow perception under urgency. Final image of shadow-chapel is charged by the central menhir’s last light. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing the chapel’s silence—tightens through each footage comparison until the spiral path forecloses excavation. Agency is exercised in the decision to wait and witness; cost is the renunciation of proof. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: erased villages, negative space, silence as vessel. Final silhouette reweights prior footage and map tear without moralizing. Subtext in shadow choreography and yarrow token carries generational grief. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in cartographic metaphors and weather-filtered attention. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments during discovery. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Metaphors (vault weeps, map’s cartographic wound) are precise and integrated. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph cadence mirrors breath held then released. Minor elevated diction in “liturgical scrolls” is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drone archaeology meets erased chapel via migrating shadow. Trope of lost sacred site is transformed through video forensics and negative-space architecture. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in final silhouette. Specificity of 1953 botanist reels anchors invention.</comment>
