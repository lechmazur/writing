<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—curating catharsis—drives every action; the locket’s grief and her humming are embodied choices that cost her anonymity and time. Leo’s interiority is sketched rather than dramatized, but the final renunciation (letting the locket go home) is earned by the four-day ritual. The micro-choice to sit and hum, not knock, crystallizes her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mailbox’s organic click reconfigures meaning without mechanical contrivance, and the cost is Leo’s public tears. Causal chain—locket hums → Elara follows → humming summons Leo → mailbox opens—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jasmine-scented courtyard and locked mailbox are tactile, selective, and filter through Elara’s curator’s eye. The mailbox constrains the final choice (no external key) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across four mornings on the stoop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can unspoken grief be safely heard? Pressure tightens each dawn as Leo’s silence lengthens; the fourth-morning door opening is the decisive narrowing of options. Cost is Leo’s public vulnerability and Elara’s surrender of the locket—both on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the humming refrain and mailbox ritual: listening as communal healing. Subtext in Leo’s “You’re the curator” and the seashell’s whispered “thank you” resists moralizing. Final image of empty mailbox awaiting the next story reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—objects “whisper,” envelopes “flutter like trapped wings.” Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Leo’s “I hear things”). No head-hopping; Leo’s interior is inferred through gesture, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic: “tarnished silver with a hairline hinge fracture” packs sensory and symbolic weight. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Occasional lyric lift (“wind catch the edge… like a trapped wing”) serves pressure without purple drift.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “curator of stories” premise and locked-mailbox ritual feel fresh yet inevitable; the locket-as-vessel-of-grief trope is transformed through Elara’s non-intrusive method. Specificity of Cedar Hollow and Mrs. Chen’s Tuesday dawn drops anchor the concept in lived neighborhood texture.</comment>
