<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chronicler’s guilt, methodical grief, and micro-choices (playing the accordion, mapping, pressing palm to graffiti) all track. Motivation to self-forgive is clear, but the sister-abandonment backstory is delivered in one expository lump rather than dramatized choice, muting the cost scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the final image of leaving without a note, accordion echo and ivy “slightly rearranged,” is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the station from archive to threshold. Causal chain (graffiti → map → song → departure) holds; only minor ellipsis between graffiti discoveries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station, ivy, accordion, and graffiti are textured, selective, and pressure-bearing. The ivy’s “tendrils like script” and the patched bellows constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each graffiti clue and musical confession. One clear escalation: “Point Zero” at the sink crystallizes the inward turn. Cost is felt (raw weeping, cramped fingers), though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as unearned unfolding emerges from concrete particulars (graffiti, ivy, wheezing accordion). Final image avoids moralizing; the rearranged ivy and lingering echo reconfigure meaning without statement. Subtext in graffiti silences is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“breathed air thick with moss and memory”). Perceptual signature—reading ivy, timing echoes—is consistent. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; occasional lyric excess (“river deltas where tears had pooled”) stays within pattern. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors cohere; final chord “shuddered…like a confession” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: flood-guilt mapped via abandoned-station archaeology and bathroom koans. Risky method (graffiti wisdom) is fully committed and integral. Specificity of ivy-as-archive and taped accordion prevents cliché; transformation test passed.</comment>
