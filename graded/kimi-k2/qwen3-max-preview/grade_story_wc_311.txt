<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"echoes clung to his ribs like frost," "hollow between heartbeats"—but the reaper’s moment of crystallizing grief is slightly under-motivated; we sense the ache but not the precise trigger that makes *now* the time to act. The final stance (heart-carrier) is earned by prior refusal to let fear stay faceless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas page crystallizes, the reaper becomes "heart-carrier," and the cost is the perpetual burden of memory. Causal lens holds—because he listened to the recordings, therefore he must name the fears. No orientation debt; anchors (observatory, dusk, prism) are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory’s cracked dome and prism actively constrain the method; the atlas page itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail—“cloak whispering like regret,” “vine-choked dome”—mirrors interior state without cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming nameless terrors into named witnesses—tightens once when he begins the naming ritual. The cost is the emotional weight he must carry thereafter; pressure grows under causal lens as each naming stiffens the page and crystallizes memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: naming as an act of mercy that transmutes terror into companionship. Final image—“crystallized atlas page pulsed once, softly, warmly”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the silence after her final note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—“wind tugged gently at its corners,” “ink shimmered like stones into deep water.” No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision (“echoes forgotten phrases”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddled. Minor loop risk in repeated “echoes forgotten phrases” is offset by rhythmic necessity. No scaffolding or synonym churn; every sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—reaper who names sea-monsters to lighten others’ dread—is fresh synthesis of mythic and emotional registers. Specificity of “whirlpool-eyed kraken” and “copper cylinders” prevents generic drift. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
