<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the recollectionist’s tactile seed-reading and trembling delight reveal contradictory impulses. Motivation (carry the mystery, not solve it) crystallizes in the final renunciation, earned by prior emotional transliterations. No secondary character pressure, but the grandmother memory anchors stakes without exposition drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “She needed to carry it” reweights the entire quest from discovery to stewardship. Causal chain—seed → emotion → transliteration → crater-glass revelation—tightens once, then pivots. Cost is felt in the grandmother’s swallowed voice and the vanished bird’s gift. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from shimmer density to final scattering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Geode walls, crater glass, and moon-kelp pouch are not backdrop; each constrains action (seed placement, palm contact, future planting). Sensory selection skews prismatic and saline, mirroring the “cheerful gloom” paradox. Spatial choreography is clean—barefoot skip, crouch, exit through fissure. Final pendant image recharges the glass’s starlight memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“before memory fades”—is signaled early and tightened by each seed’s emotional residue. Agency: pressing seeds to temple and later choosing to plant rather than hoard redefines the path. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological. Cost is conceptual: accepting that paths vanish by gift, not loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of joyful vanishing; no moralizing, only the final image of scattering conjectures like confetti. Subtext in “giddy sorrow” and “cheerful gloom” layers without labels. The bird’s self-scattering reframes absence as generosity, resonating beyond the page. Closure reweights premise without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“salt-crusted skin,” “kelp-paper”—with rhythmic skips matching the barefoot gait. No dialogue, yet internal monologue carries subtext (“Laughter… then silence… then wings folding inward”). POV remains tightly anchored; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“they said”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are controlled—“bubbles popping against stalactites” is fresh, not purple. No loops or scaffold; occasional alliteration serves cadence. Final line “before memory fades” echoes opening without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory cartography via bird-seed emotion is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names change—specificity of geode, moon-kelp, crater glass is integral. Risk in cheerful gloom tone pays off by charging the final image. No derivative echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
