<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied ("moved like a sigh," "heart pounding not with triumph but tenderness"), but the thief’s contradictory impulses remain static; no new internal friction is forced by the final beat, so the arc feels complete yet unchallenged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the thief’s stance crystallizes into "invisible, essential" translator of fate. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each moonbeam release and flower code deepens the pattern—while the half-empty jar signals felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The emerald station’s moss-cracked tiles, ivy-wrapped pillars, and spectral moonbeam bench actively constrain placement and visibility; the setting is both cathedral and accomplice, charging the final image of the service gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to press your ear against destiny’s door"—tightens as the jar empties and choices narrow to one last placement; the cost is the irreversible expenditure of moonbeams and the thief’s vanishing agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: revelation over theft, translation over control. The final image of the "soul brimming" while the jar cools reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and POV-stable; compression like "quietly savvy, always watching, never seen" teaches the pattern early. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths for set-ups, clipped fragments for reveals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors ("shadows pooled like spilled ink") are precise and internally consistent. Final cadence mirrors the thief’s fading footfall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The moonbeam-as-memory lens and flower-cipher mechanics feel inevitable and fresh; the premise synthesizes magical realism with quiet urban fantasy without cliché. Risky lyric structure pays off in a charged, non-literal ending.</comment>
