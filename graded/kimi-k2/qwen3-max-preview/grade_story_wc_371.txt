<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the bread-handling, seed-pressing, and shawl-dropping all carry contradictory pulses of grief and reclamation. The final stance—cross-legged sipping cold tea while water awakens—crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is felt. Yet the “creeping normality” lens is declared more than dramatized; we rarely see her actually mis-read the world, so the flaw feels named rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drip of the hidden spring reweights every prior desolation and makes the guerrilla seeds feel like plausible insurgency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (stale bread, moss, wisteria, candle shadow) deepens the stake of “permission to feel sacred” until the final drip re-prices it. Cost is legible in the still-untouched bread and the soil under her fingernails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard’s micro-ecology—ivy-muffled footsteps, cracked fountain basin, warped tea-house floorboards—actively constrains her choices: she gardens in cracks because the marble is otherwise impassable. The bread’s hardened crust and the candle’s tremble are returned in the final image of dripping water, creating a charged object loop. Spatial choreography stays clean across barefoot moves and seed placements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“permission from the earth to feel sacred again”—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory accrual. The middle deepening occurs when she uncloaks: the wheat-colored dress exposes her to the courtyard’s judgment and re-opens the wound of the vanished bakery. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological, and the cost is the bread left to rot and the seeds that may never grow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversals: absence (boarded bakery) → offering (stale bread) → defiance (seeds in cracks) → possible renewal (drip). No character moralizes; the sacred is redefined as a quiet rebellion against erasure. Final image avoids sentimentality by keeping the bread untouched, implying absolution is tentative, not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature favors haptic detail—“moss muffles,” “crust hardened like old promises.” Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then compresses during seed-planting, mirroring the heuristically gentle pace. No dialogue appears; voice sustains itself through rhythmic variation and concrete sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—“ghost of laughter absorbed by ivy”—and never collide. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line withholds naming the star, creating resonant negative space. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks dull the immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “creeping normality noticer” trope is refreshed by making her tool not surveillance but guerrilla gardening; the stale bread as relic converts loss into seed-offering. Overgrown palace + secret tea house could feel twee, yet the text treats them as sites of erosion, not whimsy. Risk taken: no plot twist, only accretion—yet the accretion pays off in the spring drip that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
