<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the worker’s shift from technician to pilgrim is credible. Motivation (arboreal witness) is specific and sustained, but the final beat of “remembering for them” feels slightly abstract rather than a concrete choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sextant’s reconfiguration from broken tool to dream-mapper crystallizes the arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of sitting to sketch dreams is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with felt cost—she renounces fixing and accepts bearing witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit tower and moonlit forest are selective, tactile, and purposeful; the mossy root that splits to offer relics constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (sextant on root) functions as charged object-as-setting that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring sorrow via trees—is signaled early and deepens through each dream fragment. One meaningful tightening: she stops repairing and starts mapping, foreclosing the “fix-it” path with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of arboreal witness emerges from concrete dream fragments rather than statement; the final image of sketching sorrow onto rings offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the oak’s silent offering and the lock of hair—no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the worker’s tactile perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“mossy root,” “hollow bone” chime). No dialogue, so no register drift; free-indirect texture holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“grief etched in hairline fractures”). Zero loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Minor risk of overwriting in “quantified sorrow” phrase, but it lands early and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—sextant that measures arboreal sorrow—is fresh and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse without the specific arboreal witness angle. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
