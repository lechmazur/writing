<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the liberator’s tactile relationship with soil and seeds grounds her motives. Contradictory impulses—patient strategy vs. urgent sowing—play out in micro-choices (pressing keys, planting arrow). Final renunciation (leaving the acorn key) crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vault opens, seeds scatter, and the wall’s fall becomes inevitable. Causal chain (key cipher → vault → dispersal) is tight; each beat advances goal or cost. Final image of “green” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Abandoned carnival is rendered through purposeful, selective detail (dust-choked gloom, broken ticket windows) that constrains movement and supplies the piano lock. Micro-setting (piano bench, mural) directly shapes tactics. Final arrow planted in dirt charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—breaching the vault before the wall falls—is signaled early and tightens through each beat. Agency drives escalation: decoding keys, scattering seeds, accepting capture risk. Cost is visceral (chains, dawn raid) and alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from concrete acts—seed dispersal, arrow marker—never stated. Final image of “music instead of plunder” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (arrow as beacon, not weapon).</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to liberator’s perceptual signature; diction is earthy, rhythmic, and purposeful. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Compression (“Dawn was a rumor”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops. Metaphors are precise (“dust motes danced like pollen”). Sentence rhythm accelerates toward vault opening, then exhales. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—seed vault hidden in carnival piano—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (post-apocalyptic raiders, chosen one) are transformed through botanic specificity and non-violent strategy. Risky lyric cadence heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
