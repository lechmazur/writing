<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris’s porous receptivity is shown through the immediate planting of the seed and the vow whispered to it, a concrete micro-choice that costs him years of nightly vigil; the interior contradiction between seeking beauty and embracing rot is present but stays summary rather than dramatized in scene, so the final “never meant to flower” renunciation feels conceptually earned yet not viscerally paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density—seed, room, spiral root—until the final journal line reweights the whole myth; transitions are legible, causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, and the Conceptual Repricing (“never meant to flower”) lands with undeniable cost to the reader’s understanding of Aris’s life wager.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook, willow shadow, and obsidian shoot are specific, sensory, and return in the final image; the seed-as-setting constrains every design choice, charging the closure; only the “storm-born silence” phrase edges toward abstraction, but the mossy kneeling grounds it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard space for the grotesque—tightens when clients hallucinate and when the root spirals downward; the price is visible in the obsessed returnees and in Aris’s lifelong deferral of bloom; escalation is accumulative, not causal, but the final reconfiguration makes the cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the seed’s refusal to bloom: innovation demands submission to slow rot; no moral is stated; the final journal line reweights all prior rooms as exercises in patience rather than revelation, creating resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to Aris’s perceptual filter—moonlight as mercury, soil read like braille—without head-hop; rhythmic control heightens toward the spiral root moment, then relaxes into the quiet final line; diction remains within the character’s artisanal lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is dense but patterned early (“moonlight skimmed the water like liquid mercury”) and pays off in the obsidian shoot; one mixed metaphor—“time coil around it like ivy”—barely touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed as non-blooming muse is a fresh inversion of creation myths; the orthogonal puzzle mechanics and scent-based riddles feel specific to this voice; risk is taken in the refusal of payoff, yet the choice is inevitable in hindsight, reweighting the entire genre of escape-room narratives.</comment>
