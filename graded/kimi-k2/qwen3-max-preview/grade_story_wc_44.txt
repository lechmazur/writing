<comment>Elira's quiet deliberation is embodied in steady ink-stained fingers and meticulous nightly ritual; paradoxes compel rather than paralyze her. The choice to "become noon's opposite" at climax is foreshadowed by her refusal to flee or scream earlier, a cost foreclosing ordinary scholar life. Interiority blends scholarly rigor with visceral awe, contradictions intact. Character-specific perceptual stamp—"shadows as liquid night"—remains consistent.</comment>

<comment>Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira's stance crystallizes as "keeper of thresholds" while maintaining the seal. Because-sequential linkage holds—key→orrery→resonance→interstitial vault→new role. Time is the felt cost: she will nightly walk the seam forever. Causality loop closes with ΘΑΛΗΣ-9, rendering spoon-induced noon legible as altered rule-set.</comment>

<comment>The "underside-of-drifting-rock" observatory and "skeletal orrery" are not postcard scenery; they dictate limited angles of access and force rooftop-to-dome maneuvering. Cracked dome by never-landed spoon constrains possible movements and echoes spoon logic. Spatial anchoring remains coherent across 17-night arc with no impossible positions. Micro-setting orrery becomes literal tool for harmonic reopening—constraint and climax in one prop.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—"where shadows go at noon"—tightens from curiosity to stewardship under spiraling paradoxes. Tension escalates each night via resonance pulses erasing temporal distortion, narrowing paths to acceptance of sealed awakenings. Agency is repeated choice to wind key despite burns, cost visible on her spine. Lucky coincidence avoided; every complication sourced by spoons and key mechanics.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Thesis of balance restored through measured loop-closure emerges wordlessly from ritual and inscription ΘΑΛΗΣ-9; shadows "remembered" as partners not prisoners. Metaphor of key-as-serpent-eating-tail threads causality without overt symbolism. Subtext avoids moral statement; final reweighting speaks in image of shadow on time itself. Subtle reframing of exile into cooperation feels earned rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is cool, precise, and tactile: "ink-stained and steady," "lunar frost." Compression and patterned repetition ("quietly deliberate," "closed loops") teach early and pay off at closure. Syntax tightens with stress: final paragraph collapses time through apposition. No head-hopping; all sensation routed via Elira-specific perceptual filter that notices shadows by texture and clocks by taste.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for contemplation, tight fragments for resonance bursts. High information density without metaphor muddle: "hummed through the floor, vibrating up her spine like a struck tuning fork" layers physical and harmonic sense. No loops, synonyms, or scaffold. Closing line's "shadow on time itself" crystallizes prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of spoon-caused "shadow noon" is non-obvious and pursued to full implication. Risky concept—physics exposed seams—not retreated from; key mechanism reconciles rather than resolves. Synthesis feels inevitable: rune scholar plus mechanical key equals threshold stewardship. Specificity of sealed awakenings, ΘΑΛΗΣ-9 inscription, and "noon is the seam" are irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
