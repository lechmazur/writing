<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—hands trembling, stone pulsing against his chest—but the pivotal guilt flashback is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the micro-choice that links past lie to present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single-scene, single-POV, causal lens holds; the stone’s wilt/glow pivot is a clear Decisive Change that reconfigures options. Orientation is immediate, closure lands with felt cost (tears, song in bones).</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Resonance chamber is micro-setting as crucible: copper pipes and glass bells vibrate in response to song, literally constraining how the repairman can “tether” the chip. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is signaled early and tightened by the stone’s honesty test. Escalation is causal: because the stone wilts, he must sing, which reclaims light and repels shadows with visible cost (weeping).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-through-decay emerges organically from the covenant of rust; no explicit moralizing. Final image of song seeping into walls offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—humming lullabies, “tinkersong wonder”—sustained throughout. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent; free indirect style clean. Prose modulates rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density, vivid verbs (“coaxing memory from metal”), no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“devoured by silence”) fits the fairy-tale register without drift. Final cadence earned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale tropes transformed through specific craft detail: philosopher’s stone as honesty detector, covenant of rust as revelation not decay. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric mode pays off.</comment>
