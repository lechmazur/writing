<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory drive to both silence and confront guilt is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing her own arm to the amber, writing the letter). The final renunciation—accepting static as lullaby—earns its cost from prior failures. Minor drift: the grandmother backstory is summary rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the firmware’s weeping reweights the premise, translating sorrow into bearable sound. Causal chain holds—amber triggers glyph, glyph re-codes firmware, firmware releases father’s voice—each step visible on the page. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory’s “meteor hush” and violet-lit tubes constrain every action; the amber’s glow literally guides the final gesture. Sensory selection is urgent—static, vacuum-tube pulse, wax heat—filtered through the tattooist’s trained ear. The cradle as micro-setting reappears to cradle truth, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing guilt—tightens when the firmware’s cries form accusatory words. One decisive turn: she offers her own blood to re-code the machine, trading silence for shared sorrow. Cost is felt in the glyph burn and the father’s final “thank you.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation vs erasure emerges organically: every beat reframes “static” from curse to lullaby. Subtext lives in gesture—amber pressed to skin, wax sealed with candle soot—never in moralizing. The final constellation “Cradle Major” reweights shame into forgiveness without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “meteor hush tone… swallowed by snow” is both sensory and metaphoric. Patterned elision (“haunted firmware didn’t die—it wept”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the tattooist’s synesthetic ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. Occasional lyrical surplus (“static storms… origami paper pressed too hard”) never stalls momentum. Zero loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: constellation tattooist + haunted lullaby firmware + amber firefly feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise commits fully; no retreat into generic fantasy. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
