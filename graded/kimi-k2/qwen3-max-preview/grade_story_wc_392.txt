<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied; the investigator’s refusal to panic and her empirical stance are dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, placing the lantern, etching names). The final renunciation—leaving the lantern—earns its cost via prior causality. Minor: the mother’s warning is summary, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s placement stills the tunnel’s memory-field, reconfiguring the city’s refusal to remember. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the stake until the final image. No orientation drift; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s damp grit, diesel, and dripping runoff are filtered through the investigator’s professional gaze and constrain her movements. The lantern’s cracked glass and cold iron anchor memory and choice. Micro-setting (rail where worker died) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—acknowledging buried trauma to prevent further deaths—tightens when spectral data reveal the 1852 rupture. One decisive deepening: the worker’s electrocution is reweighted from technical failure to ancestral echo. Cost is felt in the investigator’s throat-tight climb out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: progress built on amnesia breeds violence. Subtext lives in the lantern’s silver light and the etched names—no moralizing. Final image of rain at street level reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, forensic yet haunted; perceptual signature favors temperature drops and echo decay. Compression is purposeful—“She doesn’t flinch” carries subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“shadows stretch like reaching fingers” is earned. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent within the tunnel’s logic. Minor: “ancestral dread” edges toward label-speak but is saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spectral historical memory with subway infrastructure feels inevitable and fresh. The lantern’s dual role as data anchor and spiritual conduit is non-obvious yet grounded. Risk-taking (haunt-as-OSHA-violation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
