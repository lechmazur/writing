<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (fear vs. surrender) play simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to hum the lullaby under stress crystallizes her arc and earns the final shift from shame to story. Scars as waypoints is a fresh, non-generic reconfiguration. Only a hairline slip: the “story” epiphany edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single vertical stroke “breathe” reconfigures stakes and releases the held-breath world. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rune adds density until the cadence shift unlocks resonance. Cost is legible in the shimmer of still-present scars reframed as narrative waypoints. No orientation debt; pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock, ink, tea surface, and wrist scars function as micro-settings that constrain posture, tool use, and emotional focus. The crystallizing ink and mirror-still tea charge the final image when they soften and ripple. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Elira’s tactile priorities; no white-room syndrome. Could edge 9.0 if altitude had sharper tactical bite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into living story—is signaled early and tightened through each rune stroke. Agency is exercised in the decision to surrender control rather than force mastery; the cost is the irrevocable visibility of scars now reweighted as ballad. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pain alchemized into rhythm rather than erased. The final sip of tea reflecting sky offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext hums in the lullaby, ink behavior, and held breath. Complexity is honored—scars remain, yet meaning shifts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is rune-scholar-meets-child-witch. Syntax modulates with stress—long breaths calm, short clauses crystallize. No head-hopping; POV distance stays intimate. Compression (“ink crystallized when stressed”) teaches pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image, action, and interiority. Rhythm mirrors held-breath tension then release. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. High information density without clutter. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of geomantic tea ceremony and scar-alchemy feels fresh yet inevitable. Youth superstitions braided with scholarly rune craft create non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Only a faint echo of familiar “write pain into art” motif keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>
