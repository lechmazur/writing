<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses (sell certainty vs. doubt) are embodied in the cloak’s weight and the shard’s tremor; the unhooking choice is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible cost (exposure, loss of client-ready armor). Interiority is concrete, but the “conscience for hire” label is slightly expository rather than dramatized in speech or action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: promise to act → shard’s whisper → chime translation → unhooking → new stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final barefoot descent crystallizes options and stakes with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse balcony, salt wind, cold rock, and rusted chimes are filtered through Elira’s body and choices; the cloak itself becomes micro-setting that constrains movement and must be shed. Final image of the seashell recharges the tide’s erasure motif. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether Elira will keep selling certainty or allow doubt. Pressure tightens when the chimes translate to “unhook,” forcing a single irrevocable act that forecloses the old business model. Cost is the literal shedding of protective identity; escalation is causal and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects (cloak, shard, chimes) and action: the ethical necessity of embracing uncertainty. Final question to future clients offers non-literal thematic resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the chimes’ wartime code deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric compression and rhythmic control (“salt and silence,” “polished smile hid fractures”) match Elira’s profession and emotional state. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Wind-chime language is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops, strong verbs (“slithered,” “threading”), and varied sentence rhythm. Occasional elevated diction (“benediction”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: moral-arbitrator-as-lighthouse-keeper decoding wind-chime wartime ethics. The cloak of doubt as literal garment is an inventive metaphor that drives action. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
