<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The penny-poet’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“measured meals by syllables”), but the decisive shift from hoarding to gifting the sounds is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s renunciation of hoarding jars for communal listening reweights the premise with visible cost (“emptied vessels”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the pattern of jarred voices → released harmony tightens stakes without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The feral loft, dunes, and jars are rendered with tactile specificity; the music box on the sill becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment actively guides the act of opening jars to the tide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bridging generational silence—escalates as each jarred note re-enters circulation. One meaningful tightening: the widow’s recovered song forces communal listening, narrowing the protagonist’s role from keeper to conduit with felt social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation-as-redemption emerges through concrete action (uncorking jars) rather than statement. Final image of open windows and ticking box offers non-literal answer: listening itself is the redemptive act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (“windproof shadows gathered like commas”) remains consistent. Patterned elision (jarred voices as currency) is taught early and paid off at closure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“salt and sawdust,” “sea sugar”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative texture. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of bottled weather-memories as currency feels fresh; transformation of grief into communal song avoids cliché. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
