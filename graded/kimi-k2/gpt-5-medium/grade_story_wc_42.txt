<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sage repairer’s tactile patience and stubborn listening are embodied in micro-choices—thumb on mirror, palm on capacitor—that reconfigure the telescope’s fate. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: certainty is a “luxury” yet he dares “to hope.” The final renunciation—unlearning the Moon’s silence—carries felt cost in the memory of the fleeting leaf. Voice remains singular and vocationally specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronometer’s pause and the sharpened Moon image reweight the premise that noise can be message. Causality is tight: quake → misalignment → smeared photons → iterative micro-adjustments → pulse revealed. Orientation is immediate; no props teleport. Cost is legible in the “weakest tea” drunk at dawn, acknowledging exhaustion and fragile hope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lunar observatory above cloud-sea is rendered through tools—cooling lines that “breathe,” a spinning hand that “paces”—each constraining the repairer’s tactics. Micro-setting (sensor ribs, regulator whine) replaces panoramic exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: cracks crawl, pedestal sighs, bearings feel tides. Final image of “braided shadows that looked like writing” charges the closure with new legibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral heat signature before it disperses—is signaled early and tightened by the quake’s misalignment. Escalation is accumulative: each adjustment narrows the blur until the pulse emerges. Agency is iterative micro-tuning; cost is the sleepless night and the tremor risk. No coincidence resolves; the director’s silence is pressure, not solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as ethical stance against imposed silence. The leaf motif threads from memory to guiding principle without overt statement. Final reconfiguration—“the Moon spoke… our work was to answer”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the spinning hand’s plea and the tea’s weakness carries understated cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, tactile yet cosmic: “luminous ache,” “pale claws,” “glass touched with a wet finger.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths during calibration, clipped fragments at the reveal. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the repairer’s perceptual signature. Technical diction is accurate and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled—“gray coin refusing to spend itself”—and never muddle causality. No loops, no filler; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar seismology meets artisanal instrument care. The spinning chronometer as metronome for cosmic rhythm is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity. Specificity of occupation and place prevents template drift.</comment>
