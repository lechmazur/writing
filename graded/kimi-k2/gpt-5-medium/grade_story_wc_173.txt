<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Chaste courtesan's motivation—harvesting suppressed voices—is visible, body poetic but her interior lacks contradiction mid-scene; choices follow a single arc without tension; Earned Stasis in last lines “learning refuse and still sing” forecloses obedience with felt cost, securing score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal linkage intact: ritual threads → bowl → loom → city awakening each ‘therefore’ chain without leaps; orientation granted by early prism anchor; closure “city inhaled differently” is Decisive Change under Causal lens with on-page cost paid by guards’ dropped pikes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silver courtyard glints under starlight in opening stanza, prism prism sanctuary returns in ending image—setting constraints choice path through grate lock—meets 9+ gate, cap 8.3 because prism constrains but courtyard stays decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: free collective voice vs. palace conformity; pressure escalates single beat “guard patrol arriving” narrowing timeframe; cost visible as bowl set and grate click; no secondary reversal, but single tightening suffices at 600-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—voice against institutional silence—arises from actions rather than thesis; final moment “the city inhaled differently” offers resonant, nonliteral shift; avoids sermonizing, achieves Charged Poise without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush lyric third-person retains tight perceptual signature—frost, lanterns, snowlight filtered through courtesan’s tactile ritualist lens; rhythms mirror choreography; no head-hops, sustained diction “alarming serenity” threads from open to close, earns high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dense musical sentence craft almost flawless; occasional metaphor stacks in mid-scene (“tiny suns onto marble veins”) flirt with purple but clarity preserved; closure sentence clean; avoids loops or scaffold, reads aloud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Transforms familiar rebel-in-palace trope into luminous voice-harvest ritual; synthesis feels inevitable given prism, courtyard, looms; specificity of silence-thief courtesan and thread-loom mechanics grants originality above mere ornament.</comment>
