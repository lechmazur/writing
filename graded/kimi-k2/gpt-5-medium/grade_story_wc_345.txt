<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collective “we” POV is consistent; micro-choices (sharing water, knotting ropes) show communal values under pressure. Interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; no single embodied emotion anchors the final drift. The shift from fear to collective trust is credible but diffused across the chorus, muting individual cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula appears only after collective exhaustion is shared, reweighting prior quarrels. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of bell, chalk, gifts tightens until the final image. Causality is loose but coherent; drift into the air-river feels inevitable in hindsight. Cost is felt in the communal bruises and forfeited solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, mothweed, and moss sidewalks are vivid and selective; the bell garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (where to meet, how to signal). Spatial choreography during the rescue is clear. Environment guides tactics—rafts must be woven from orchard materials—charging the final image. One slip: “orchard planet” remains abstract; no sensory anchor to planetary scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective survival versus individual grievance—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when the arch shard strands families; the braided alarm forces coordinated action. Cost is visible in raw hands and traded apologies. One tightening beat suffices, but the price is communal rather than personal, slightly blunting urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of interdependence emerges from bell, chalk, and shared thirst; no explicit moralizing. Final image of mist on faces offers non-literal answer to “how to enter respite.” Subtext in chalk commands and Lio’s wind-fingers sustains ambiguity. Complexity is present but diffused across the chorus, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, collective voice is consistent; syntax modulates with urgency (“threaded the arches like a humble comet”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is communal yet distinct. Occasional elevated diction (“respite,” “nebula”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; few redundancies. Metaphors occasionally stack (“humble comet,” “orchard of bodies”) but pattern is coherent. Information density high—each line advances image or stakes. Minor filter-verb clusters (“we kept finding,” “we spoke”) do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost-run orchard colony on floating rocks—is fresh yet grounded in tactile detail. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without bell, chalk, and nebula mechanics. Risky collective POV succeeds without gimmickry. One near-echo: “orchard planet” feels generic sci-fi, slightly undercutting specificity.</comment>
