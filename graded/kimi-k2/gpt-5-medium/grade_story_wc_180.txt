<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender is vividly particular—his quartz eye, daughter’s tin, and wariness of goodbyes shape every move. Interior contradiction (repair mastery vs fatherly failure) is embodied in his refusal to open the tin and his choice to weave the ribbon. Mira functions as apprentice and proxy family, forcing the redefinition of fatherhood through her questions and final playful shove. Cost is visible when the ribbon knot graft holds like an answer, closing a path of silence and guilt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard breathes, debts are discharged, the raft of unspent intentions is pushed downstream in a single beat (“the cathedral learned to breathe on purpose again”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ritual acts accumulate until the canopy shivers loose, leaving space for future. Causality stays coherent within this lens, and the contract breach remains an economic loss that reweights personal gifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gothic orchard is compressed with tactile specificity—“ribs heavy with peaches and pears” and dangling roots poked by Mira. Every detail is filtered through the mender’s repairer eye; rafters groan, sap slurs, the pew becomes bench once more. The graft above the nave is the moment where setting literally closes the arc, constraining the final promise. Setting never drifts from the mender’s immediate toolshed of perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake is the mending not of wood but of broken father-daughter covenant; this is signaled early (“for money, quieter and sharper”). Tightening occurs when the mender ties the knot, a single decisive act that risks Mira’s trust and whatever forgiveness the daughter may or may not grant. Cost is visceral: the ribbon holds like an answer, leaving the tin still unopened. No off-stage fixations—every escalation is earned on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of letting go to keep alive—“some economies grow from gifts the books cannot tally.” Subtext operates in the silence of the tin and the ribbon’s second use, never spoken aloud. Final image of readable rustle implies that inheritance works only if the prior page is allowed to turn; no moral is delivered, only the price acknowledged. Complexity accepted: maybe the ribbon returns, maybe it becomes Mira’s, refusal is its own kind of closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is compact, sinewy, textured: technical diction of mending collides with orchard lyricism—“branches arched like ribs” and “sap slurs.” Syntactic compression serves pressure: “We walked… into a day that could forgive the breach of contract by harvest.” All metaphor is character-specific—the orchard is a body, vows are fruit that must be pruned. No head-hopping; POV confidence remains humble craftsman.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sentences are clean, rhythmic, dense with double duty (“branches arched like ribs, heavy with peaches and pears and a small ache of neglect”). No loops or scaffold phrases; every clause tightens or charges. Line propels—syntax breathes when the orchard inhales again. Minor near-gem but no clarity blur: line-level craft flawless under micro-scope and closure intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>The orchard-turned-cathedral and “deciduous vows” premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of contract failure into ritual gift economy risks sentiment but lands earned. Specific tools used non-literally yet convincingly: hair ribbon as graft, bell as lung. Stakes feel individual not archetype; fatherhood fissure could not be transplanted to another plot skeleton. Bold, singular vision without gimmickry.</question>
