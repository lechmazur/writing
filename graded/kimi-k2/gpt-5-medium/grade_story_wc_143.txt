<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the inspector’s contradictory impulses—scientific duty vs. personal memory—play out in micro-choices (flicking the ampoule, slowing breath). The final endurance/renunciation (letting the moth go, accepting the hush) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “purposefully curious” is stated rather than dramatized in one beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shutter click crystallizes both preservation and loss, reweighting the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each timed flame tightens the cadence toward dawn. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the moth’s vanishing and the narrator’s throat “clean and still.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Moonlit crater, basalt mosaic, and ancient snow are filtered through the inspector’s professional eye and personal grief, constraining movement and camera placement. The radio array’s red blink and the moth’s lantern abdomen charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency. One minor drift: “space age” is named late but serves closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture proof before extinction—is signaled early and escalates via the timed chemical countdown. Each colored flame narrows options; the final white vial forces the decisive shutter press. Cost is visible: the moth escapes preservation, the hush claims the song. Agency remains with the inspector throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of witness versus possession emerges through action: photographing the last song becomes an act of love and theft. The glacier moth as “folded page” and the hourglass grain reweight meaning without moralizing. Final image—the hush belongs to breath, not archive—offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: precise scientific diction braided with lyrical mourning (“pepper of the space age,” “soft-bellied tide”). Perceptual signature is consistent—every detail is filtered through the inspector’s lantern-trained eye. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“cathedral where the only sermon was the sound inside my ribs”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. High information density without clutter; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the dawning hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar glacier moth’s final song witnessed by a legacy timekeeper—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Familiar tropes (last-of-species, archive vs. memory) are transformed through specific lunar tech and personal lineage. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
