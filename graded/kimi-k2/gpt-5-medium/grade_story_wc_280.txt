<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—synesthetic perception, tactile memory of mother’s hands—yet the ghost remains a cipher whose choices never truly test the narrator; the final “letting go” is more gesture than crucible, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the timeline shivers but holds, the orchard door reconfigures what “tomorrow” can be, and the cost is the nightly return itself. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained; only a faint causal gap—how the coin actually steers the maze—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the hedge corridors literally rearrange under the echo-work, the lantern fruit cues the final image, and the mossy stage constrains every footfall. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true and the orchard’s breathing reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchoring the fractured timeline—escalates through each echo and blue chord until the orchard’s door crystallizes the cost: perpetual caretaking. One tightening suffices, but the ghost’s stakes feel vicarious, muting the visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship versus release emerges through concrete particulars: spilled-music paint, brass-cold coin, mother’s tip-counting hands. Final image of “home” as sound reframes nostalgia without moralizing; ambiguity is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmically controlled—“green cymbals,” “burgundy in the rafters”—with no head-hop. Patterned elision (e.g., “orchard answers with its own remembered footnotes”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only occasional stacked metaphors (“lantern fruit bright as cues, pears humming in the prop loft”) flirt with overwriting. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, and the final cadence breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the haunted theater into a living archive where caretaking is performance; synesthetic navigation and orchard-maze that rewrites itself feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
