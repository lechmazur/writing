<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth”), but the shift from “underachieving” to “caretaker of questions” is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation of ownership is earned yet feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: removing the keystone dims the light yet leaves a “glove of lingering luminance” for ordinary work—cost is felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers texture until the final cadence reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound spire, fog, and keystone are rendered with sensory precision; the keystone’s final removal flexes the platform, making the setting an active constraint. Micro-setting (notch in masonry) charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting automated sameness—tightens when the protagonist chooses to return the keystone nightly, foreclosing ownership. Cost is visible in the hush that stays on the hands, but escalation is more accretive than sharply rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity emerges through concrete particulars (blank paper table, white moths of doubt) without moralizing. Final image of the sky’s “question mark” reweights earlier material with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“brilliant dimness,” “lingering luminance”—remains consistent; perceptual signature is selective and character-bound. No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Minor scaffold in “light spilled out as if it had been waiting” is offset by high information density and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is transformed through anti-commodity stance and luminous refusal; keystone-as-question is a fresh inflection. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
