<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the “watcher’s burden” drives micro-choices (testing buckle, tapping code, leaning with the ship). The scarred-pilot relationship supplies relational pressure that alters trust, but the final nod is slightly under-costed compared to the prior failure memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nod and loosened weight crystallize ongoing debt under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each beat (static, tap, lantern color, rope play) tightens the corridor of air until the cradle kiss. Cost is legible in the lingering “not done paying.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The nocturnal arbor, rope veins, lanterns, and cradle are not backdrop; they dictate tactics (green-blue fog, rope length, rail tap). The vortex’s heat and the arbor’s creak constrain the revised route, charging the final image of the ship folding “like a tired hand.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—escalates through sensory tightening: static clears, seam squeezes, wind buckles the wing. One decisive deepening: the pilot’s request for new eyes forces the watcher to risk reputation again; cost is the unspoken apology and the nod that acknowledges unpaid debt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as fragile infrastructure emerges from rope, rail, and radio; no moralizing. The final nod and loosened harness reweight the earlier scar without stating it. Ambiguity lingers—trust is “carried better,” not restored—yielding resonant complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and pressure-modulated: “trees that outgrew the ground and decided to keep going.” Compression and elision (“apologies blow away up here”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (“stitched moth,” “pondwater lamplight”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the wind blister, then exhales at landing. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The aerial arbor supply run feels inevitable yet fresh; tropes of sky-pilot and watcher are retooled through muscle-memory code and atmospheric seam reading. Specificity of rope, lantern color, and nod transforms generic rescue into singular vision. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
