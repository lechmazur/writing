<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrator's tactile, scent-driven sensibility is crisp and embodied, but Harbor remains observation, not agent; her tail-thump is emotive yet doesn't force a choice. Interior contradiction around staying vs leaving simmers but never ignites into a visible micro-choice that changes tactics—the walk to the relay is inevitable. Final stance of "distance is a lens" feels inherited, not wrested from prior motive. Earned endurance present, but cost is diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Glow-through leaf at dusk provides a luminous Decisive Change: the relay awakens, sister laughs, a live connection is forged where silence reigned. Causal chain—cylinders → grooves → scarecrow sky-write—tracks cleanly. Closure image of adjusted focus carries felt conceptual cost, though the relay's hum abstracts the emotional price a notch.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Environment is welded from scavenged ribs and rusted skins; every breath of sand and rebar constrains movement. The scarecrow tower’s copper crow and wax-filtered light beam are vivid, site-specific resources that enable the final broadcast. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible positions or prop drift across scenes.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bridging distance to sister—clarifies early and escalates as the cylinders’ riddle forces action. One meaningful tightening: raising leaf at final light is irreversible; it either works or the promise fails. Cost is present—dusk light is finite, leaf will be consumed—but expressed symbolically; concrete sacrifice of another opportunity could have sharpened the bite further.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Core question—can distance be reframed rather than conquered—arrives via imagery, not lecture. Wax-filtered autumn light literalizes “lens” metaphor; relay response becomes answer. Resonance lingers without tidy moral, inviting reader to recalibrate own separations.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, precise, sensorily lush: “door learning to breathe,” “rust and memory” as organs. Every sentence feels filtered through a synesthetic archivist; diction controlled and distinctive. No moment drifts into generic or editorializing abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose sparkles with density and rhythm: “Shadows turned amber and violet,” “lattice of syllables,” but occasional stacked metaphors flirt with overwriting (‘door learning to breathe’ is on the edge). Yet clarity never falters; no loops or filter-verb dullness. Final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Retired tracking hound turned nostalgia bloodhound gives fresh turn to war-dog trope. Sound-beamed leaf compass re-enchants post-apocalypse survivalism. Risk is lyrical quietness rather than gore, coherent and distinctive. Specific invention outweighs post-scarcity scrapyard familiarity.</comment>
