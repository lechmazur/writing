<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste the seam where silence stitches storm”), motives cohere, and the final renunciation—leaving the hush and star fragment—carries visible cost. Yet the grandmother’s cameo, though moving, arrives as summoned memory rather than active pressure, softening the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s backward-played prologue reconfigures meaning while the moon’s gravity exacts a felt price. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the pattern of signals, faces, and final playback tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gorge, mast, and velvet box are tactile constraints—cables knit shadows, dishes tilt under lunar pull—charging the final image. Micro-setting (lightning scar as stylus groove) directly shapes the ending’s playback metaphor. Weather and height affect every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened once when the city demands placement over resurrection. The protagonist’s agency (tilting dishes, threading star fragment) narrows options and incurs the cost of letting go the hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings are not erased but honored as beginnings. The final image of the gorge-as-orchestra-pit reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the star’s burn scars and the hush’s clarifying silence deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in the trade’s idiom (“fantasy practicality”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; patterned elision (“stopped naming the blinking”) is taught early and paid off. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line layers image, action, and stakes. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cables knitting shadows”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—abandoned towers that respire with lunar perigee and replay their own prologue—feels inevitable yet fresh. Synthesis of radio ghosts, Hollywood detritus, and celestial mechanics is specific and risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
