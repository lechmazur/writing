<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“mittened hands,” “breath frost its rim”), but the mentor’s reappearance is more spectral echo than active pressure; the final vow feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a concrete bodily cost beyond symbolic light-sewing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s self-binding vow reweights the archive’s survival and his own identity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of measuring, fracturing, re-binding—culminating in the lantern-warm birds crystallizing into a key-shaped constellation. Cost is legible in the line “I became another entry.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The frozen library is no backdrop; its quartz hush and icicle alphabets constrain every motion and choice. The lantern’s halo and the cracked slide function as micro-settings that literally shape the final binding act, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—archive’s survival—tightens when the mentor’s fractured vow threatens the lens. One decisive intensification: mounting the cracked slide and accepting the library’s directive. Cost is the protagonist’s absorption into the catalog, visible in the ledger’s irridial ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship versus oblivion emerges through the act of measuring absence itself. Final image of constellations “promising to hold long enough for morning” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and consistent—“quartz hush,” “slow thunder,” “filaments of vows.” Perceptual signature remains steady under pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. Occasional stacked metaphors (“snowbirds made from filaments of vows”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses archival sci-fi with lyric mysticism in a way that feels inevitable. The magic-lantern-as-memory-keeper is transformed through specific sensory logic; no trope remains unturned. Risky compression and conceptual stakes pay off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
