<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing its finality—surface in micro-choices like tracing the stele or fitting the gnomon. The final renunciation (to stay and tend) is earned by prior listening and carries visible cost (abandoning the dig’s official purpose). Minor slip: “faith had not been lost, only interrupted” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt sundial re-anchors time and the narrator’s identity, with felt cost (abandoning departure). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (bones, roots, coins) tightens until the final alignment reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is visceral and specific; roots braiding skulls and the sundial’s bronze throat constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (smell of leaves and turned pages) filters through the narrator’s bias. Environment actively guides the decision to stay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and tightened through each unearthed object; the sundial’s restoration crystallizes the trade-off. Pressure grows via accumulative pattern rather than causal reversals. Cost is legible: the dig’s official goal is abandoned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges organically from bones, coins, and the narrator’s own exile; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the shadow kissing “home” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext in gestures (returning tooth to heel) deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature (“earth speaking a dialect I almost remembered”) is consistent. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. Dialogue with Sami carries subtext and advances the rebuild beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor “orchard had always been a mouth” barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora memoir and necropolis pastoral; the sundial-as-rib graft feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under the Accumulative lens. Specificity of pomegranate-wood gnomon anchors universals.</comment>
