<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The violinist’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“my ears are acoustically perceptive”), but the final stance crystallizes more through lyrical image than a visible micro-choice; the cost is felt yet not dramatized in a single decisive act, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the song unbinds the hush and the footprints left by the tide reconfigure meaning with undeniable pressure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each added object in the bowl tightens the pattern toward the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are not backdrop but active constraint—roots drink brackish light, timbers loosen under music—charging the final image where footprints mark a song unfinished. Environment shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—escalates as each object added to the bowl increases the weight of “gentle obligations.” One clear tightening: the decision to visit the halves and almosts forecloses retreat into silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: unfinished song, unfinished fruit, unfinished paths. The final image of footprints left by the tide offers a resonant, non-literal answer—beauty is the ongoing walk with what remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through acoustic sensitivity. Patterned elision (“chronic hush,” “magnificent simplicity”) is taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Occasional stacked metaphors (“rust like hedges keeping the wind polite”) flirt with excess but never stall momentum or cloud the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The post-catastrophe orchard concert, the bowl as archive of unfinished survivals, and the refusal of tidy endings synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
