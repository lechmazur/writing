<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my coat smelling of brine and smoke and unslept prayers”), but the peacekeeper’s calm intuition is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to stay a season is earned yet feels slightly under-costed compared to the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard’s reconstituted sphere becomes a “room” where factions glimpse mutual humanity; cost is the peacekeeper’s open-ended commitment. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored glimpses tightens stakes without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard and shifting floes are tactile and constraining; the lantern-pears and groaning ice guide the final gathering. Micro-setting (vintage-store mirrors) functions as tool, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing another child’s death—escalates through mirrored revelation of shared guilt; the tightening beat is the proposal of joint beacon-sapling watches. Cost is the peacekeeper’s indefinite stay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-practice emerges from the shard’s absences and the child’s re-framed legacy; final image of “practice is how peace keeps” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature (“shadow-laced,” “ice groaning like a thing trying to sleep”). Patterned elision (mirrors’ consent) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure (“lantern pears flung across faces”). No loops or mixed metaphors; final cadence breathes with earned poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of seer-shard, orchard-lighthouse, and mirror-reconstitution feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
