<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s calm is embodied in steady hands and borrowed rhythm, but the interior contradiction—tremble hidden beneath calm—never sharpens into a choice that costs her anything; she remains an elegant facilitator rather than a protagonist who risks or renounces. The townspeople’s micro-choices (laughing at the mirror, offering words) are vivid, yet the archivist’s own arc plateaus. Closure is communal, not personal, so the Earned Stasis lands on the town, not the lens we occupy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor of photographs left in the field becomes a living map the town must walk, a Charged Poise that reweights grief into shared stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each story adds density until the final image of “sunset stitched down” crystallizes the new stance. Cost is visible in the unspoken admission that some places “we have not named” remain raw. One micro-transition (nightfall) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The lavender field and factory ribs are not backdrop; their scent and silhouette constrain where photographs can be placed and how bodies move. The mirror-bottomed map case functions as micro-setting that forces self-recognition and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is exact: circle, corridor, forward walk, backward walk. Weather (night ink, diesel ghosts) evolves with the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collective healing—is signaled in paragraph five and tightened when the archivist demands a word “the town could give a stranger tomorrow.” Each story adds pressure; the final corridor walk is a single decisive act that forecloses endless mourning. Cost is communal and felt, though individual stakes for the archivist remain muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the literal act of mapping memory onto land; no character states “we must heal.” The mirror’s reprise reweights earlier photographs so the viewer sees self inside history. Final kites of “bread, patience, blue” offer non-literal hope without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: unnamed pain remains alongside laughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—“bees stitched yellow punctuation”—with perceptual signature of someone who thinks in patterns and gentle improbabilities. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments when photographs are handled. No POV drift; the archivist’s diction stays consistent even under communal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each sentence layers scent, light, and social texture. No loops or scaffold; “vines climb the factory walls, as vines climb the fences, as vines climb the old ideas” is purposeful anaphora that teaches pattern and pays off. Minor slip: “ridiculous pairing” is self-conscious but brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a grief-map made from ribbon, twine, and contested skies is fresh; the mirror reveal feels inevitable yet surprising. Transformation test fails—this could only happen here, with these ruins and this scent. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss.</comment>
