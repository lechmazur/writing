<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s internal contradictions are felt in the push between “construct bridges” and the fear of losing harmony; embodied in every step across planks while the cuckoo-weight bites her palms—decisions charge each beat with visible cost to hands and town trust. Renouncing isolation compels her to open the tower to many mouths and risks; the stance is crystallized in the final downbeat. Characterization earns its closure.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><closure>Closure is the completed bridge-span that reconfigures the silos from barriers into lungs: “the town… cradles itself in a chorus.” Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, this ending reweights the stake—shared voice displaces separation—with visible communal cost (labor, vulnerability, loss of former purpose).</closure><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain of gathering townspeople, balancing the counterweight, and letting the elevator speak accumulates toward one resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the elevator’s gravelly admission that it “once held your harvest apart.” One transition (night→next day) fits scope. Minor clarity lapses on spatial hand-offs keep it just shy of 9+.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The clock tower, catwalks, and grain elevator are tactile, weighted, and constrict choice; every plank Mara lifts is measured against spinning moons. Sensory focus telescopes from “hush of borrowed starlight” to the groan of rivets underfoot, grounding escalation. Setting charges the final communal embrace under lantern spill; no orientation gaps.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—braiding isolated souls—pressures Mara to risk the creaking bridge in a single escalating arc. One meaningful tightening: the elevator’s plea forces her to cede sole agency to the town. Cost is felt in surrendered privacy and former custodial solitude; no reversals required at this length.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts—hoisting planks, mixing languages, sharing soup—rather than abstract sermonizing. Emergent moral: community is built from repurposed scars. Final image of “cradled chorus” reweights the earlier silos-as-barriers motif without stating a moral; ambiguity and resonance coexist.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Lyrical, rhythm-driven third-person intimate locks to Mara’s selective perception: she hears gears as “patient revolutions,” feels the weight “tug at her elbow.” Micro-compressions (uno-two-tre) braid Latin cadence into English syntax, teaching the reader the multilingual pattern. No head-hop; no diction drift into corporate register.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is dense yet agile: “grain elevator talks… voice like gravelled rain” evokes texture without excess figurative weight. Occasional slight paraphrase loop near lantern choreography is minor; never obstructs cause. High information-per-line; syntax breathes with the sway of the rope; no mixed metaphors at closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Astonishing conceit—lonely grain elevator seeking rehabilitation as gathering hall—feels inevitable once voiced. Synthesis of choral librarian, polyglot lullabies, and cuckoo-weight counterbalance is specific to this town and cannot transpose wholesale. Execution stays coherent; risk doesn’t slide into gimmickry.</question>
