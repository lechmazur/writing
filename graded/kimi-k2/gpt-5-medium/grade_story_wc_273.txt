<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“serene anger keeps my hands steady”), but the mentor’s vanishing is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the causal link to the protagonist’s final refusal. The albino trait remains ornamental; no sensory or social consequence surfaces. The hummingbird’s micro-choices (hovering at the throat) crystallize the cost of vanishing, earning the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the metronome “forgets how to count” after the protagonist dissolves into ink, costing the market its currency. Causal chain holds—ink → patterns → metronome heart → refusal—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; stakes and timeline are legible by line 4. One minor ellipsis: how the ink on skin erases the outline is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The wind-carved ribs and “fossil-smooth” tents are not backdrop but instruments: the ink flows along gravity’s “confession,” the metronome is built from “bones of storms.” Sensory selection is urgent—salt, clicks of cooling rock—filtered through the tracker’s professional gaze. The hut’s varnished tables and ticking metronome constrain the final choice, charging the image when the protagonist dissolves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the market in slowed time—is signaled early and tightened once: the ink reveals the algorithmic buyer, forcing the refusal of the throne. Cost is visible—the protagonist’s outline disappears, leaving a “hollow I left in the air.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: crisis monetized as temporal lag. The metronome’s offer of “a crown of near-misses” reframes earlier mentor wisdom into a moral choice. Final image—the clock forgetting to count—reweights the premise, leaving the reader to reckon with the cost of engineered panic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is spare, crystalline, and consistent: “I move in a consciously wild stillness, prowling without hurry, the way a cat studies a clock.” Syntax mirrors the tracker’s taut patience; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression (“ink tastes shame”) is taught early and paid off when the hummingbird “learns the hollow as a song.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances image or pressure; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “eddy, laminar tongues, hiccups where time refuses.” Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under stress, longer breaths in reflection. Zero artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: disappearing ink as forensic tool against a metronome that sells panic-time. The albino tracker and hummingbird drone feel inevitable, not quirky. Risk—the protagonist dissolves rather than destroys—heightens coherence. No derivative echoes; the final reconfiguration is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
