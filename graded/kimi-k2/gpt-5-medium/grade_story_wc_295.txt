<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—fear of the telegram vs. compulsion to decode—drive micro-choices. Relationship with Mara is a crucible that alters both their stances. Final “yes” to keep witnessing is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of star-flux → grammar tightens until conversation unlocks inscription. Closure is Charged Poise—shared silence after reading reweights stakes. Cost is the ongoing burden of witness, crystallized in final log entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory is tactile—red lamps, clicking domes, wet coat on railing. Micro-setting of pressed daylily constrains the choice to open telegram. Final image of dome aligned to Cepheid recharges setting as active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode temple inscriptions to heal. Pressure escalates as star data demands live conversation; silence becomes basin where sorrow is shared. Cost is perpetual vigilance—no end to witnessing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through star-grammar and mirrored thirst; no moralizing. Final image of “healing travels fastest by ordinary words” reweights prior glyphs without stating thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—ink-stained chronicler’s diction, rhythmic control under pressure. Compression taught early (“lines trembling like held confessions”) and paid off in star-syllables. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern. Minor loop in “shared burdens passed like lamps” vs. “traded burdens” but does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star-flux as grammar, telegram as daylily-sealed oracle. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specificity anchors premise. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
