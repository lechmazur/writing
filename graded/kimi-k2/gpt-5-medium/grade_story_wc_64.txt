<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “blithe mask soften into respect” lands as earned cost. Motivation (discover hidden intentions) is consistent and intensifies through tactile micro-choices. The final renunciation—planting poppies around the revealed absence—forecloses the path of silence with visible tenderness. One hairline slip: the phrase “tenderly organized” is repeated as label rather than dramatized action once too often.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gardener’s act of naming the empty grave in loam crystallizes both truth and mercy. Causal linkage holds—every beat follows “because/therefore” from chess-clock hush to poppy ring. Cost is legible in the gardener’s nicked palm and the widow’s lifelong silence. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo’s “listening metal” and the ring of asters actively constrain where the gardener can dig and what he must plant. Sensory detail is selective—velvet hush, lunar gray, stubborn color—filtered through the gardener’s precise attention. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, tools, and distances track cleanly. One minor redundancy: “velveteen gloom” appears twice without new inflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the widow’s hidden intention—is signaled early and tightened once when the tapestry’s border reveals the missing grave. Escalation is causal: each decoded knot narrows options until only the empty patch remains. The gardener’s agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in the physical nick and the moral weight of disclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of love’s dual obligation—to the living and the dead—emerges through the widow’s border-knot confession and the gardener’s final planting. Subtext operates in gesture: the sovereign case becomes both coffin and cradle. The ending’s poppy ring offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire tapestry without moralizing. No thematic drift; every image serves the core question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“choir that never finished learning the hymn it loves” is character-specific and unforgettable. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during excavation. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the gardener. Occasional elevated diction (“monarchic sigh”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret” teaches the pattern early. No loops or scaffold; information is layered without redundancy. One mixed metaphor—“fishing line for lost stories”—is minor and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of chess clock, tapestry border, and cemetery cartography feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The widow’s double confession—thread and document—transforms familiar war-time concealment into intimate moral calculus. Risk-taking (lyric compression, object-as-grave) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; no template residue remains.</comment>
