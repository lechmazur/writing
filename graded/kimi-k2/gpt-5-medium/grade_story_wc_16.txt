<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The interior contradictions are vivid (“carefully reckless”), yet much of the emotion is narrated rather than embodied mid-scene; the renunciation of silence lands, but the causal link between the apology-symphony and Lio’s return feels lightly asserted rather than dramatized.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure earns a Charged Poise: the revised Breviary scores stand like a held-open door—visible reconfiguration with relational cost. However, mild lens ambiguity drifts between accumulative lyric and causal apology; the “because” that unlocks Lio lingers in emotional suggestion rather than driven beat.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive breathes as instrument—dust motes become footnotes, shelves sigh—yet no physical prop or spatial constraint materially narrows the final choice, capping the reach of setting’s agency.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust after silence—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator writes interconnected promises; the price is the public, legible vulnerability on the page. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal, but the deepening of stakes is clear.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—trust as ongoing composition rather than monument—emerges from image and action, avoiding overt thesis. Final resonance is modest but specific: “please begin again” as non-ritualized answer to silence.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct, poetic internal voice sustains throughout; deliberate syntactic heightening feels author-motivated and pattern-taught. The risk pays off in aural coherence and final tonal convergence.</question>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Poetic density is purposeful; metaphor rarely impedes clarity. Minor echo of “carefully reckless” risks cadence hiccup but does not obscure action; no prose artifact touches the closure.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The extinct-language/archive/musical-trust conceit is fresh without ostentation. Pattern risk of abstract meta-laboratory is grounded through tactile detail—“wrist steady, heart fugueing.” In hindsight, ingredients feel inevitable.</question>
