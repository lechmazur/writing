<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the locksmith’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final “trade of attentions” feels more stated than dramatized, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s thaw and the spinning wheel crystallize the new equilibrium. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; each gentle adjustment accrues until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The frozen library, driftwood scent, and cedar breath are vivid and selective; the hall-of-mirrors setting constrains every adjustment of the clocks, charging the final image of thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—tightens through each micro-adjustment; the cost is the irrevocable gift of the notched wheel and crescent key, foreclosing ownership of the rhythm.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair as reciprocal attention emerges through concrete acts and images; the final dawn reweights earlier frost without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (tide-listening, brass teeth, cedar memory) modulates under pressure without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“kelp-like ribbons of vellum”) flirt with excess but never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith, eclipse keys, and mirrored clocks; the driftwood nostalgia motif reconfigures into a non-obvious final gift, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
