<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt and rot and lullaby”); her contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. caution—play out in micro-choices (looping the fob, pausing the recorder). The father’s absence is anchored in present stimuli (watch fob, maps) and tilts her stance. Cost is felt when she pockets the “brittle inhale” and accepts the price of having broken trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the recorded crack of trust reconfigures the market’s web and Lark’s future. Causality is tight—each false start tightens the invisible web until the lime-split gasp triggers Kettle’s recoil. The watch fob’s tick is a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The pier’s “rotting” timbers and “lantern light” are tactile constraints—Kettle’s reach across limes is spatially tracked. The watch fob and recorder function as micro-setting objects that alter choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows under hush: touch and nod replace sight. Final image of gray seam over river recharges the pier’s breathing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and escalates through each false-start transaction. The tightening is visible when Kettle’s fingers rehearse theft and the smuggler recoils; cost is the recorded betrayal itself. Agency is Lark’s deliberate orchestration; luck (cutpurse) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between silence and fracture; the hush itself becomes a fragile contract. Subtext lives in gestures—Kettle’s eyes vs. mouth, the cutpurse’s hiss. Final image of “quiet returns after it has held something trembling” offers resonant non-moral reflection. No thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, river-wind cadence; perceptual signature is Lark’s tide-chart memory and “human weather.” POV remains tight single; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual (“Do not sell that” in eyes only). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the lime spill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is selective—“limes rolled bright as moons”—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line’s “message in a bottle” is earned reprise, not ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of recording trust’s fracture under enforced hush is fresh; pirate market rendered as tactile soundscape rather than trope. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure. Specificity of “river watch” and tide charts grounds the world. Transformation test: story collapses if trust-sound is removed.</comment>
