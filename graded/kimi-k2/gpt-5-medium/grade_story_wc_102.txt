<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied, but the “spiritually curious” label surfaces as self-diagnosis rather than dramatized contradiction. The final decant moment shows earned change, yet the past-life mirror feels more narrated than pressured. Micro-choices (dab, exhale, pack) do carry cost, anchoring the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge exhales easier, ribs unlock, love is released—felt cost is legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of breath-images thickens until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct is not backdrop; its stone arches, pollen, and river ribs actively constrain the camera’s breathing dialogue. Micro-setting (the camera box, Kwan Yin tear) functions as tactile extension of body. Final image of emptied jars placed into “room the world gives” charges the setting with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating and releasing unused love—is signaled early and tightened through each breath-exchange. Escalation is Accumulative: density of translucent letters increases until the stance crystallizes. Cost is felt in the unlatched closet behind ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of hoarded vs. released love emerges organically from concrete breath-practice; no moralizing. Final image of decanting into “emptied jars” reweights earlier glass-room memory without stating a lesson. Subtext hums in the bridge’s listening stone and pollen like “golden reasons.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that notices light as tactile matter. Syntax modulates with breathing cadence; no head-hop or register drift. Experimental compression (“pilgrim of sparks”) is taught early and paid off in the final exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“lantern inside the heart of a cloud”) risk overwriting but pattern is consistent and taught. No loops or scaffolds; clarity at closure intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Camera obscura as confessional for surplus love is a fresh angle; transformation test passes—story collapses if device or tear removed. Risky lyric mode commits fully without gimmickry. Specificity of “kwan yin’s tear” and “pollen like golden reasons” anchors universals.</comment>
