<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iria’s refusal of easy bargains and her embodied labor (grinding kelp, writing on shells) anchor her motives; the amber bottle acts as both promise and constraint. Interiority is concrete—she “listens for footsteps that would not come” and feels the bottle’s ticking—yet the apprentice’s flight is reported, not dramatized, slightly blunting the cost. The final stance—renouncing wishes for shared labor—earns its charge through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the town’s revival is underway, wishes are renounced, and the amber bottle’s faint ticking confirms the cost of choosing labor over miracle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each small act (bell, charter, sweeping) layers density until the cove “no longer resembled a memory.” Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The paper-lantern cove is evoked through selective, purposeful detail—bobbing lanterns, beached skiff, tide-carried shells—each constraining Iria’s tactics. The amber bottle and bell function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Iria’s priorities: ash under fingernails, kelp ink, the bell’s polished storm-scars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving a civilization without miracles—is signaled early and tightens through each micro-choice: writing a charter, ringing the bell, sweeping the square. The cost is visible in Iria’s exhausted refusal of ease and the townsfolk’s returned accountability. One meaningful deepening: the bottle’s ticking proves the invisible engine has started, foreclosing the wish era.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: revival is endless rehearsal, not performance. Subtext lives in gesture—the bell lit with flint, the bottle passed like a candle—never sermonized. The final image of “plausible futures” thickening the air offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “salt in her coat and ash under her fingernails” grounds the alchemist’s texture. Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives during sweeping, longer cadences while plotting gardens. No POV drift; the sailor’s dialogue carries distinct diction (“I carry a debt”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “she ground kelp into ink, pried dates from warped timbers” compresses action and atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh—“lanterns bobbed like faded thoughts”—and never muddle causality. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—post-wish ghost town revived by anti-miracle labor—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (alchemist, amber vessel) are transformed through tactile specificity and communal process. The risk of a quiet, accumulative ending pays off with undeniable resonance.</comment>
