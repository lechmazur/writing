<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the narrator’s pacifism is dramatized through the refusal to pry and the careful tuning ritual. The inherited promise tightens motive and culminates in a visible cost—signing both names—yet the arc is more accumulative than causally driven, capping the score just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers silence, resonance, and legacy until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—diary opened, promise inherited, cost legible in the double signature—without a single causal reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Workshop, bowl, reed, and mothwing microphone are rendered with tactile specificity; the brass clasp’s final shiver constrains the decisive act. The graphite sky and staged stars echo the theatrical tone, charging the ending without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering Anya’s silence archive—tightens once when the clasp yields. Pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the cost is the ethical weight of inheriting the promise, visible in the signed blank leaf.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-through-listening emerges through concrete acts: tuning without bruising, recording hush, signing the blank page. The final image reframes prior silences as “space for strangers,” offering non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—sound as touch, silence as architecture. Theatrical sincerity modulates from address to whisper without register drift; no head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (“tone that coils like smoke”). No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates with the fuse and stills with the diary’s opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Pacifist sound-tuning to open a diary via resonance is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The conceit commits fully; removing any instrument or silence would collapse the closure. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
