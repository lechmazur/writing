<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is precise—catalog drawers “smell of kelp and iron,” the valve clicks “like a key”—and his micro-choice to hand the valve to the woman crystallizes a stance with visible cost: he forfeits sole custodianship of the harbor’s memory. The woman’s embodied exile (“used to march”) supplies pressure that forces his final act. No slips touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the archivist renounces possession of the valve, accepting perpetual collaboration as the price of “practicing return.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each staggered interval of tapping and silence layers density until the final ledger entry reweights absence as “channels navigated.” Cost is legible in the wrapped valve relinquished.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is not backdrop but instrument: gulls “punctuate” staff-line masts, fogged glass becomes a palimpsest for the parade route. Weather and architecture constrain tactics—tap cadence must fit the plaza’s puddled spacing—and the final image of tide carrying moonlight recharges the setting as active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to give the harbor a sound it can practice—tightens when the woman’s exile history raises the cost of failure. One deepening: the shift from solitary archiving to shared metronome. The price is the archivist’s surrender of control, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “navigated absences” emerges through concrete acts: tracing parade curves on fogged glass, counting silent intervals. The final ledger entry—“absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels”—offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights all prior fragments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is ocean-salt precise: “catalog drawers smell of kelp and iron,” “salt takes shape in a handprint.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hop. Compression (“tone: none”) and patterned elision (“spacing, the careful cadence of missing steps”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: every sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives under the tapping beats, longer cadences in reflection—culminating in the crystalline final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conceit of an “ocean-spray archivist” who charts absences via corroded trumpet valves is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The transformation of exile’s silence into collaborative rhythm feels inevitable in hindsight, a synthesis that could not survive relocation to another setting.</comment>
