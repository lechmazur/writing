<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s vow of non-interference is embodied in micro-choices—recording the mushroom alphabet, trusting the swan’s folds—yet the interior contradiction (desire to witness vs need to shelter) stays largely reflective rather than enacted under pressure. The final “loosening” of judgment is credible but abstract; cost is felt more as atmospheric erosion than as a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s stance crystallizes into “only the pen, and even that lightly,” a renunciation of agency that carries the cost of perpetual fragility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return to crumbling mortar, mildew, and flood layers density until the final image reweights the entire chronicle as compost. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but taught early; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but constraint: moss-veined aisles force retreat, volcanic glass cellar offers regenerative silence, river’s growl dictates burrow timing. The obsidian room’s texture—slick, humming—directly enables the mending of books and thus the keeper’s endurance. Spatial anchors are consistent; sensory selection mirrors urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving witness without intervention. Escalation is accretive—each decay layer (pollen, mildew, flood) tightens the keeper’s options until the final stance renounces repair itself. Cost is atmospheric yet legible: the peace that shelters is the same peace that flakes into the tea. One deepening, no reversal, sufficient for lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: witness as compost, knowledge as living decay. The final image of loosened laces and tethering silence reweights the entire chronicle without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, mold, and the swan’s creases; ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and rhythmically controlled—“ink ferments,” “brittle metronomes”—with perceptual signature rooted in the keeper’s synesthetic attention. Patterned elision (time, causality) is taught early and paid off in closure. No POV drift; diction stays within the keeper’s lexicon of archivist and mystic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical coils contract into spare final lines. High information density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-as-ecosystem, silence-as-glue, origami-as-navigation. Risky lyric structure commits fully and lands closure without gimmickry. Specificity of “mushroom alphabet” and “regenerative silence” anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
