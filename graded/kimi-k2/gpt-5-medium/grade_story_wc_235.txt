<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“feral nostalgia baring its teeth”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final bargain with the nostalgia-creature is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the scroll re-orders dream-dates into a map that lets endings meet beginnings, with the cost of accepting chronological confusion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early and paid off in the sky-script.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cabin, ridge, and birch scroll are tactile and selective; the stove ticking and snow rasping anchor urgency. The scroll becomes micro-setting that constrains the final mapping act, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—tightens when the scroll’s wrongness must confess its pattern. The deepening is driven by protagonist agency (bargaining with the nostalgia-creature) and carries visible cost: surrendering envy for continuity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: narrative as the only lasting heat against entropy. The final image of endings meeting beginnings for coffee reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature sharp (“snow hissed like applause withheld”). Patterned elision taught early and legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern. One mixed metaphor (“floor rose like a wave… buoyant as a leaf”) barely grazes clarity; otherwise zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-mapping ranger who autographs dreams for a dying. The jealousy-of-past-selves engine and scroll-as-calendar feel inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
