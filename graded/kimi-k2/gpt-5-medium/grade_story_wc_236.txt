<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"fever smudged my senses," "shy percussion of every drip"—but the aromatherapist’s loss of smell is more backstory than active contradiction; the midwife’s grandson is sketched rather than pressured. The final micro-choice—leaving the empty space in the dish—earns a quiet renunciation with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “reading between lines” thickens until the repaired clepsydra becomes Charged Poise. Closure lands on the text message—“We are three”—a resonant reconfiguration that reweights every prior drip and silence with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fog, water clocks, and the cracked clepsydra are not backdrop but instruments that constrain choices—repairing the hinge, calibrating breaths. The shop’s micro-setting (basin, siphon clocks) is tactile and lived-in, charging the final image of the father cradling time. Meets 9+ gate: the clepsydra constrains the closing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—steady the father’s fear—tightens when the screw is fitted and the clock’s new rhythm becomes permission rather than ruler. Escalation is textural: each drip layers emotional density until the final recording of “water and laughter” crystallizes cost. Agency remains with the protagonist; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary miracles” emerges through the concrete act of mending time with a birth-scarred screw; no moralizing. Subtext lives in silence, fog, and the unheard recording. Final image reweights the premise: time as body, not ruler—an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“water clocks murmur like cautious throats”—with a perceptual signature attuned to absence (smell) and micro-gesture. Compression and elision (“reading between lines”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or advances beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer breaths in reflection. Clean mechanics; only hairline slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist who maps emotion via water clocks—feels inevitable yet fresh. The midwife’s screw as time’s suture is a non-obvious synthesis that transforms a familiar object. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure remains legible.</comment>
