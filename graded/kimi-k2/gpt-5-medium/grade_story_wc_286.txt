<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific and embodied ("quiet palms, breath measured like a slow kick wheel"); micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values and foreclose a path (leaves the cups and hum, accepts continuing fragility). Cost is visible in forfeited water and open-handed non-coercion. A hairline slip—momentary bee shimmer lacks causal leverage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the cups remain, braided timelines persist, cost is her departure of self-gift and water. Orientation anchors land within ~120 words. Final image reweights premise: kindness as the slow kiln of change. One causal ellipsis (how cups fire with no fuel) is a micro-scuff, not break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (faded lantern glass) and wasteland both constrain tactics (shadow-light alternance cues cup placement). Sensory detail is selective: heat shimmer, smoke flat, breath on glass. No setting lapse touches closure. Minimal deduction for physics-light kiln.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to give kindness without forcing change—tightens from spill of water to cup-fire to self-withdrawal. Micro-turn: renunciation of possession. Cost is explicit: last water, bodily breath baked into cups. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of practiced tenderness emerges from specific objects and ritual choices; final image reframes earlier question without sermon. Lyrical accumulation activates CR as the oasis continues without her. Avoids over-tidy moral by preserving ambiguity of “even if only for a day.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sustained: tactile clay language, measured kiln syntax, mirage logic of light. No head-hop, punctuation choice supports cadence. One fragmentary lapse—“a bass made from wings you could not see but could almost remember”—slightly over-ornate, not disruptive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with exertion and pause: compress–expand syntax maps walk/stand/sit. High information density across lines; minimal scaffolding. Minor clause echo in “braided three threads,” mitigated by immediate scene payoff. No lexicon drift or figurative muddle near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—“phototropic to kindness”—transforms passive eco-setting into active relational mechanics, synthesized through character ceramist lens. Stakes non-obvious: not restoring oasis, but sustaining its slow-memory. Fresh inflection crystallizes in “she intended to be that someone.”</comment>
