<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific (“dust prints its diary”), embodied tension between duty and morbid curiosity. The final micro-choice—winding the barrel backward—earns its cost, releasing the ghosts with a tangible hush; no relationship crucible on page so status bullets irrelevant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: each observation (ceiling sag, dust pattern, ledger) tightens the quest until the decisive act of paying back the stolen hours. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with an audible sigh of released time and the ceiling’s new arrangement. No orientation debt, no retroactive rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The peeled-knuckle building, dust-mapped mouse paths, and spring barrel operate as micro-setting that governs access, risk, and symbolic charge. Concrete tool-handling (pliers, joist splinters) grounds every observation; no credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the living honest”—is signaled early and escalates only once, fitting the 600-word scope. Choice to unwind spring pays perceptible cost; the silence that follows is an earned alteration rather than coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed/laundered time emerges organically from events; no authorial sermon. Final image of the office “lighter by the weight it lost” offers Conceptual Repricing of memory and guilt without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice coheres through perceptual signature (elevator tech diction, dust dialect, ghost whispers). Rhythm breathes under tension; compressed lyric moments (“dust swirled like silk let go”) teach their pattern. No register drift, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Syntax pulses: short inhales under threat, longer languid loops in reflection. Metaphors are fresh yet exact (“ledger like a moth”). No loops or filler clusters; every clause does at least dual work (e.g., “mouse paths curved like erasable roads”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Remixes ghost story, theft of time, and circus residue into a cohesive micro-myth with no stock beats. Specificity—horologist’s mainspring as payroll clock—feels inevitable yet unforced. Not top-tier only because premise remains recognizable; transformation is deft rather than radical.</comment>
