<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bonsai tutor’s interiority is embodied and specific—hands “learned only drift,” compass “clicked like a throbbing tooth.” Contradictory impulses (discipline vs. regret) act simultaneously; the final renunciation to “prune only what asked” is earned by the cove confrontation and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass hesitates, lace glows cerulean, and the tutor’s new stance crystallizes with visible cost—the abandonment of coercive shaping. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each salt-grass step and tide-licked image deepens the regret pattern until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Islet, casuarina needles, driftwood “nested like unkempt bonsai” all constrain movement and metaphor; the cove itself becomes the crucible where apology must be spoken. Weather and micro-setting actively shape the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens through the clockwise walk and tide-fed deepening; the cove forces the decisive utterance. Cost is palpable: relinquishing lifelong practice of “shaping storms into cages.” One clear escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of restraint vs. acceptance emerges from the tutor’s craft and failure; the muted cerulean that “would not crack under sun” reweights every prior image. Final image of bowing to the tide offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is slow, tidal, and precise—“rhythmically placid” cadence mirrors oceanic breathing. Perceptual signature is consistent: compass ticks, lace drinks reflections. No head-hop; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; figurative language serves pattern—compass as “throbbing tooth,” tides as “larger lung.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Final cadence shift is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bonsai discipline meets maritime ghost lore via antique lace navigation. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; driftwood as “unkempt bonsai” is inevitable in hindsight yet surprising.</comment>
