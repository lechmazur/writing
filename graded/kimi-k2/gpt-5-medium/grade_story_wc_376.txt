<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied, specific (“I wilt near dishonesty”), motives rooted in craft and empathy. Micro-choice—halting gilding, then refusing leaf-post—costs livelihood to protect integrity. Interior contradiction: duty to the city vs. refusal to abet lies, enacted in two clear beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure crystallizes in RR (Charged Poise): the collective opening of the vault and declaration “Pluviary of Spoken Things.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—revelation of archive → pressure → collective act that reweights power. The ending makes the before/after legible: secrets once bottled now circulate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective micro-setting: “damp tunnels,” “condensate beaded along rails,” citronella sprig trembling under breath. Toxic sky and sealed cloches actively constrain access, forcing subterranean leaf-post and hatch route; environment guides each choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake clear early: the hunger to retrieve lost, unsent words. Pressure accrues as gilding refusal threatens profession and city communications dim. Escalation centers on protagonist agency: withholding letter-craft, opening archive—each step costs with visible social price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the value and danger of candor. Nothing is declarative; concept reframed from “mildew-tasting” dishonesty to collective relief when jars open. Subtext suffuses silence—postmaster’s fogged windows, the vents’ laugh—without overt gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric voice is taught early with “gilded-leaf calligrapher” and sustained (“greenhouse gutters hummed; condensate beaded along rails”). Patterned diction under pressure propels cadence shifts; no head-hopping, POV firmly grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft deft: balanced sensory detail with breathless momentum. Occasional dense metaphors (“greenhouses dimmed, as if even the leaves withheld their anecdotes”) skirt overwriting but remain purposeful. No loops, clean grammar, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical tech-meets-message system, post-apocalyptic archive ethics. Specific detail—tin-stained fingers, zinc plates—lodges the world firmly outside cliché. No mimicry, genuine risk sustained; concept fully owned.</comment>
