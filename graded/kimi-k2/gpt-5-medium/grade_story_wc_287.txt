<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—“I tuck the tooth into my sleeve” shows motive under pressure. The lock-picking beat crystallizes the father-daughter inheritance and stakes. Cost is visible: the click mistaken for the heart deciding not to leave. Slight drift into lyrical summary near the end keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers pressure until the beam rekindles. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the harbor “leans toward the brightness” with felt cost of reopened grief. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor, skiff, and lighthouse constrain every move; moonlight on broken windows becomes “a congregation of eyes.” The lantern glass and brass tooth function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the gardener’s tactile bias. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the light—signaled by the dropped petal. Escalation is accretive: each stroke of oars, each salt-bitten hinge tightens the task. Agency culminates in the decisive click and flare. Cost is the reopened wound of parental absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited caretaking emerges through soil-to-lock metaphor and the final beam “rooted” back home. No moralizing; resonance carried by image of child pointing. Subtext in the silence after the click deepens the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric yet grounded in tool and soil lexicon. Syntax modulates with effort: short clauses under physical strain, longer breaths during reflection. No POV leakage. Patterned elision (“the quivering hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional stacked metaphors (“lantern breathes like someone waking in a spare bed”) flirt with excess but serve the accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fire-escape gardener who picks locks and tends light is fresh synthesis. Harbor rekindling as private grief ritual avoids cliché. Risk lies in lyric compression; payoff is the earned image of light slips planted in brick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
