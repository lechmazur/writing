<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“hand nicked by paper,” “bruised permission”); the scholar’s contradictory impulses—reticence vs. the need to testify—are dramatized through micro-choices with the crystal. The final renunciation (carrying the crystal to the printers not to argue but to play it) is earned and forecloses the path of spoken testimony, with visible cost in his silence. Minor slip: the printers are off-stage, so status dynamics cannot fully register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sound/light patterns reweights the stake of “no new rooms for words.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the tilt of memory and breath that will “play” the crystal—reconfiguring the printers’ options without spoken argument. Cost is legible in the scholar’s refusal to speak and the hush that “holds the pressure of things wishing to be said.” Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is not backdrop but instrument: dust becomes constellations, shelves form an “angle” where hush becomes visible. The crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining every tilt and breath. Light and dust evolve with the scholar’s listening, charging the final image. No spatial drift; every detail is filtered through POV urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to testify to growth once lexicons end—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each card (Sprout, Scar, Orchard) thickens the sonic pattern until the scholar’s stance crystallizes. The tightening is the decision to “play” rather than speak, with the cost of perpetual silence. Agency remains with the scholar; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: growth as a grammar of tending, language as migratory rather than fixed. The final image of “someone else’s discovery” reweights the entire meditation without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the tilt of crystal, the shrug—never in statement. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush (“a murmur folds…settles”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the scholar notices scars, intervals, wet leaves. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate. Compression and elision (“he nodded and shook his head”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“dust becomes constellations of practiced neglect”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clicks during the crystal’s cracking, longer cadences during reflection—supporting momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—lexicons have ended, yet growth continues through sonic memory—is fresh and non-obvious. The crystal’s acoustic recall transforms a familiar library into an instrument of testimony. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
