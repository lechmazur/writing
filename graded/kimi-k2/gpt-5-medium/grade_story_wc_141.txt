<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The myth-buster’s contradictory impulses—gloomy cheerfulness, trust in ribs over logic—are embodied in micro-choices (winding the peg, thinking of failure to move the compass). Interiority is concrete, but the final renunciation lacks a visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “It was never about certainty… but about kindness carried forward.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure deepens through density and cadence shift. The cost is conceptual (renouncing certainty) rather than felt, but the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory, cello, and shell function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the dome’s acoustics shape the method, the shell’s warmth signals alignment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the riddle before the tide drags it away—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through deepening resonance and pattern break rather than causal turns. The tightening is meaningful but the price remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as kindness carried forward. Subtext operates in gesture (shell biting palm, cello speaking in unpronounceable vowels). Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, patterned elision taught early (“gloomy cheerfulness like a raincoat”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Occasional flights (“tired but merry widow”) risk overwriting but serve tone. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—retelling myths through resonant cello to coax truth from the sky—is fresh and specific. Synthesis of music, astronomy, and kindness feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
