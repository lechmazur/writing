<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Operator’s loneliness, failed quest for a perfect moment, and lonely craft are all embodied through micro-choices (type alignment from frost patterns, decision to print the eternity clause, final sigh). The caretaker’s flaw—destabilizes systems—shapes every beat and is visibly paid in cost when the library shudders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moment-to-moment causality is crystal: frost-braided clause → library threatens rupture → operator chooses wobble over perfection → closure via a compressed-crystal moment that reweights memory and buoyancy. Lens holds (Causal) with felt stakes (mother’s voice lost twice, library trembles).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard, cloud-sea, frost glyphs, bottled whisper—all used tactically: orchard responds to each printed sheet, cloud sea laps like teeth, frost dictates type. Spatial pressure and pressed-circle finale make the environment constrain and charge the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: eliminate flawless symmetry or sink. Every beat escalates under this knife-edge choice—operator’s refusal to seal perfection heightens cost, and the printed circle is the decisive tightening that keeps the library afloat with audible rustle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: compression of eternity vs. negotiated imperfection. No moralizing; the final snowfall image revisits the Mother wish with altered meaning—eternity tasted, rejected, paid in a heartbeat stored like paper in a bottle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyrical but precise diction (fuselage of bruised panses, frost braided the day into a script) filters perceptually through the caretaker’s fatalism. No POV drift; repeated “rustling awakenings” becomes a patterned heartbeat under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sensuous yet ultra-lean—every sentence advances or recharges an image (“The circle closed with a sigh”). Rare metaphor stops momentum only once (“patient teeth are the cloud sea”); otherwise rhythm accelerates with escalating stakes while avoiding any loop or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Take the familiar “library as garden” trope and renders it specific: books grow like fruit, glass sap freezes into clauses. Fresh inflection—buoyancy negotiated through imperfection—feels inevitable in hindsight; risk paid off without gimmickry.</comment>
