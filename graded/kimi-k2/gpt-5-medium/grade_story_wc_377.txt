<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iri’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her silence is not just trait but active choice that constrains tactics. The moment she “smudged the ledger with a small black star” crystallizes cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so 9+ gate not met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: Iri refuses the Archive Keepers, foreclosing their path with visible tremor of restraint. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of listening intensifies until final image reweights wonder over record. No causality break; cost is legible in the trembling glove.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bluff, iceberg fragment, and sculptures function as micro-setting that directly shape choices—e.g., “she nudged the iceberg fragment into a new angle” alters the harmonic outcome. Environment constrains tactics and charges final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder versus archive truth—tightens once when Keepers arrive. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: their rustling garments add pressure until Iri’s refusal crystallizes stance. Cost is felt but not as visceral as Q2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sound vs. ledger, wonder vs. record. Final image of “the ridge returned it in kind” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silence carries resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through Iri’s tuning ear. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long breaths calm, fragments tighten. No head-hop; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; only minor loops (“the way gardeners tune the soil by scent and patience” could trim). Metaphors cohere; rhythm accelerates under pressure. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—seasonally mute bell tuner who sculpts truth from wind and ice—is fresh synthesis of familiar motifs. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
