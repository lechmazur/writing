<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“I rub the gear before I sing the clicks”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational; the decisive act of handing the gear to the child is under-motivated on the page and arrives as gift rather than earned turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the garden’s ongoing, patient labor with visible conceptual cost (“infinity is only patience practiced across the heart”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of echoes and petals taught early and held to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nebula garden is never a postcard; its petals constrain tactics (“Do not feed this place flame”) and the gear’s brass coldness charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; micro-setting of falling petals functions as both environment and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking generational fear of fire—is signaled early and tightened through each traveler encounter. Cost is felt in the protagonist’s relinquishment of the gear and the perpetual labor of tending; however, the tightening beat is more accretive than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance vs. transformation emerges organically from the garden’s refusal of flame; no moral is stated. Final image reweights the premise: light shared without fire is patience made infinite, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific (“petals fall like slow comets”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping. Syntax and diction remain controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked metaphors risk overwriting (“moonmilk,” “generational patterns like iron filings”) but never obscure causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a nebula-tended anti-flame garden is fresh; generational trauma rendered as cosmic horticulture feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the gear and petals prevents abstraction; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
