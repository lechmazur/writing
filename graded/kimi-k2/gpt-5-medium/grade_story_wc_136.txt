<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling certainty, like a sketch trembling toward completion”), but the cartographer’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist steps through the mouth into a corridor of unsaid words, reweighting the premise with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of punched holes, arrows, maps—culminating in the charged image of lanterns hung on stars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and atmospheric; the starlit vault, mist, and depot constrain movement and mood. The phantom punch and folded maps function as micro-settings that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—tightens through escalating pattern: arrows, clicks, constellations. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mouth demands proof of listening; cost is visible in the relinquishing of measured maps.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cartography-as-avoidance emerges organically; the final image of hanging unsaid words as lanterns offers a non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the promise of “kinder measures.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature (“analytically artistic”). Patterned elision (phantom conductor, smoke-made conductor) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with high information-to-line ratio. Occasional stacked metaphors (“windows holding reflections without passengers, waiting”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design; no loops or artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, trains, and unspoken truths; the phantom punch as both relic and key is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
