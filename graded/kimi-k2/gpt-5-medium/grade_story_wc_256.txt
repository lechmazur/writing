<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied ("hands powerfully gentle"), but the arc is more observational than choice-driven; the volunteer’s moment is the only visible cost, and the narrator’s own shift is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell station layers texture until the final crystal bell reconfigures the city map into braided light. Closure is a Charged Poise—pilgrimage circuit now lives in gestures—cost is the quiet relinquishing of certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Laboratory, lens, and ferry bell function as micro-settings that constrain how sound is bent and listened to; golden shadows and carbide moonlight charge the final image with felt luminescence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honest listening without spectacle—tightens through each station; the volunteer’s grief becomes the pressure test, and the narrator’s renunciation of destination crystallizes the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-braid emerges organically from ferry-bell sandbar and cutlery-kitchen memories; final line’s “city tuning itself to hope” offers resonant, non-moral reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—prism-song, braided threads, courthouse rain—remains consistent; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature (keeper of echoes) colors every sensory filter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional soft-focus phrases (“mathematics of survival”) flirt with abstraction but never stall momentum; no loops or mixed metaphors near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-as-pilgrimage, grief-as-tide, city-map-as-crystal; risk of lyric excess is held in check by tactile specificity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
