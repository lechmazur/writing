<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cartomancer's interior contradictions—guilt vs. pursuit of time—are embodied in micro-choices like tracing the crack onto cards. The stakes escalate through her willingness to climb and repent, and her final renunciation (Earned Stasis) forecloses future time-loss with visible emotional cost. Only minor slip: one passage summarizes rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds from saucer crack to midnight pilgrimage to stalled-second chamber, each beat narrowing options. Closure unit (return with empty cards) reconfigures meaning via Charged Poise: now she knows where minutes hide. One orientation bump—moon phrasing drifts distract peaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Midnight glade functions as micro-setting that alters tactics: cloud-stairs constrain ascent and the frost-grass anchor the ritual. Lantern insects act as time pendulums, charging the ending image with felt urgency. Description is selective, never postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving lost time—intensifies as each stalled second demands a confession, tightening choices. Agency drives escalation: every named regret narrows future minutes. Cost is legible—her rising throat-closing beauty marks the price for each retrieval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular image—traced hand outlines re-stitched—rather than assertion. Final reweighting of time and motherhood arrives via cloth silhouettes re-printed together, a non-literal answer that reframes prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric interiority lands embodied: “wind stacked the clouds into staircases” both sees and reconfigures world. Voice remains first-person cartomancer throughout; no head-hop. Rhythm under pressure matches ascent urgency without decorative overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion: varied cadence, zero loops or clichéd body lists. “choking beauty” carries idiosyncratic weight. Overwriting metric: figurative language appears only once every 4–5 beats; earns density point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cloudbound repentance premise transforms familiar motherhood-loss trope through specific tool—birthday tablecloth handprints—making final charge inevitable. Stakes feel fresh and rooted in cartomancer’s trade rather than generic grief.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Entire journey proceeds on her decisions; climactic unfastening of crib mobile engages her trade and motherhood guilt. Her final whispered gratitude shows the cartomancer role pays closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Saucer crack seeds early, guides card spreads, and closes aligned with lifeline. Setting it over tablecloth hands reshapes stakes in final beat—landmark reprise with cost.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cloudbound repentance changes scenery (cloud staircase) and defines ritual—pouring minutes back via stalled-second chamber. Concept actively redefines tactics, not theme echo.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Willingly perplexed” constrains every spread choice and rite; delights in not solving patterns too soon pays off in final willingness to be perpetually confused. Trade-off visible.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Unfastening the mobile is direct source of the ringing moons’ lullaby patched at closure. Cannot swap without breaking final sound cue.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Hand prints on cloth signal family custom early (setup) and are revisited to re-trim missing years; mechanics matter: align crack and lifeline to listen.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Midnight glade anchors ritual ground and provides lantern insect clocks; removing it halts entire sacrificial geometry.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“After the birth” narrows purposeful urgency in prelude; lantern insects literally pendulum seconds. Timeline tracked by rising moon.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Desire to recover lost minutes is dramatized in every confession; price—rising beauty and choking guilt—creates escalating friction on the page.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>“Choking beauty” tone modulates from guilt to awe during ascent, charges ending tableau of spare dawn light lifted home like milk.</question>
