<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tuner’s interiority is sparse but embodied in gesture—heel-toe pacing, thumb on cracked bronze—showing contradictory impulses: infinite patience vs. urgent ribs. His single decisive choice (asking the town to walk) reconfigures relationships with felt cost: they must keep returning, winter included. The mother’s wary smile and the children’s laughter supply external pressure that alters his stance. Flaw: no interior contradiction voiced in scene; motivation remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the town agrees to “a practice, the unglamorous rhythm of return,” foreclosing instant revival. Causal chain holds: fork-strike → stone memory → footstep mapping → bell speech → communal cadence. One transition (dawn after first night) is legible. Cost is visible: “perhaps a winter spent keeping time.” Orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused: archway, cistern, cobblestones. Each constrains tactics—the archway becomes a throat, the cistern a tuning partner. Sensory detail is selective (dust cursive, thyme smell) and filtered through the tuner’s ear. Final image of the sparrow singing under the arch recharges the opening hush with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring shared balance through communal listening. Escalation tightens once: from solitary tuner to twenty feet braiding grief. The bell’s first chord is the decisive intensification that reweights options—windows open, laughter returns. Cost is winter-long commitment; agency remains communal, not deus-ex-machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: harmony as civic covenant rebuilt through embodied rhythm. Subtext in the mother’s trembling story and the children’s laughter carries the cost of return. Final image of “walking the measure they made together” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in “perhaps a winter.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “the stones remembered,” “tail writing cursive in the dust.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for dusk hush, clipped fragments when the bell speaks. No head-hopping; focalization stays with tuner until final communal lens. Distinct perceptual signature: sound as architecture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are precise (“dark tongue wavered like a blackbird”) and internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates during communal pacing, then exhales at closure. Minor elevated diction (“covenant of sound”) fits mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—reviving a ghost town via footstep tuning—is fresh and specific. Tropes of healer/artist are transformed through communal labor rather than lone genius. Risk: quiet, accumulative arc without antagonist, but coherence and cost justify the choice. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
