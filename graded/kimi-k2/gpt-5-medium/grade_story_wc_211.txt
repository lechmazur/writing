<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the scribe’s contradictory impulse—archive vs. spare the child—drives every beat. The final renunciation (letting stylus go still) is earned by the childhood memory and carries visible cost: the prophecy is left unrecorded, the orchard’s fate deferred. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sensory echoes and charged objects tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—unarchiving the wax shaving forecloses the safe path and shelters the child’s breath. Cost is legible in the orchard’s sigh and the scribe’s descent “speaking a language so old it only describes weather.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Orchard-atop-skyscraper is anchored early and constrains the final choice: roots cracking the roof vs. fruit kept. Micro-setting (basin, wax shaving, quinces) functions as pressure tools. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered; every detail bends back to the stake of recording or sparing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—archive or spare the future child—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the prophecy’s warning. One decisive turn: the scribe releases the stylus, accepting unrecorded mercy. Cost is the orchard’s uncertain future and the scribe’s self-imposed silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy vs. archival duty emerges through concrete action, never stated. Final image of “mercy ripening” reweights the orchard and the unwritten prophecy. Subtext in the child’s tour voice and the docent’s rail warning charges the ending without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and internally coherent; perceptual signature in phrases like “velvet disquiet” and “language so old it only describes weather.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under prophecy, longer breaths in memory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of rooftop orchard + oath-scribe + wax prophecy is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails: story collapses if any element swapped. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
