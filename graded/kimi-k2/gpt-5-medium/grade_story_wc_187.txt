<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archivist’s voice is textured and queasy with nostalgia, choices paced to ritual rather than just ink. Interiority stays specific; no generic placeholder feelings. Earns not being only a binder by stepping into rain and trading her own name for audience’s echo—visible cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single lyric scene held under Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds via density shift of shared memories reweighting archivist’s solitary stake. Closure: Charged Poise—lightning stitches silhouette to monolith—so new cost of standing alone is legible without spoken moral. Pattern of return taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Every surface—stormlit stone, wet facets, quill’s solar resin—particularized through tactile ritual use. Observatory and forecourt are environment-as-tool, constraining placement of shadows and footsteps that become names. For 9+ gate, body/tool (quill/glittering forecourt) charges final image by re-threading sun memory onto page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—selfhood carved from collective memory—tightened by archivist’s micro-choice to speak her own plum-taste memory in rain. Cost is relinquishing archival anonymity and feeling her outline sewn to monolith. Escalation comes through density of borrowed stories demanding space, not external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of identity vs memory emerges from ground of offerings: baker’s steam, navigator’s iron. No sermon; final image of stitched silhouette is non-literal re-weighting. Complex without tidy morality—embraces that some stories remain un-claimed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinctly lyrical yet anchored POV—selective metaphors (sun-warmed plum, resin-heated ink) stay within lexicon and echo sensory continuity. No head-hop; progression from reserved scribe to exposed narrator charted by rhythmic slowing. Earned transition without drift into purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Compression achieves high density: “Every drop chimed and the deepening hush afterward felt like a page turning without a hand.” No loops; rhythm accelerates during lightning stitching. Figurative language serves specific pressure instead of decoration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mosaic of borrowed memories turns trope (archive = repository) into lived metamorphosis. Fresh angle: identity sculpted by weathered attic of others’ rain. The lightning seam is new and yet inevitable—risk that crystallizes cost.</comment>
