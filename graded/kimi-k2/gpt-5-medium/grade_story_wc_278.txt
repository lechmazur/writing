<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The constellation-tattooist’s guilt-driven motivation is embodied in the amber-handling and self-tattooing beats; interior contradiction (hush vs. stay) is dramatized through micro-choices rather than summary. The final act of inking his own wrist crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor drift: the “girl whose laugh had not yet begun” backstory is slightly abstract, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—self-tethering that reweights the premise—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causal chain from the recorder’s playback to the final inked pulse is legible and irreversible. No orientation debt; the lab’s geography stays coherent. Cost is palpable: “I am not forgiven, not yet” + the amber burn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is not mere backdrop; its floorboards “ring with narratives” and the recorder’s firmware actively constrains tactics. The amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when pressed to fresh ink. Sensory economy favors hush and dust over visual clutter. One hairline slip: “meteor hush fell over the lab” could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt by listening—is signaled early and tightened when the recorder translates “stay.” The single deepening beat (self-tattoo) forecloses the option of continued flight. Pressure escalates via the baby’s cry and the letters’ directive, all under protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable: the inked tether and the word “thank you” crackling from nowhere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between flight and attentive presence; the amber’s choice to “hold” reframes the moral calculus without moralizing. Subtext in the glyph and the recorder’s stuttered lullabies deepens resonance. The final image—map pointing inward—offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior guilt. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to “ghosted frequencies.” Patterned elision (“time folds… tape and splices”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the tattooist. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses under the needle, longer breaths during reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors even in peak beats. High information density: “ink a map forward” / “hush the dissonance” / “amber is resin that could have let go.” Minor cadence repetition in “hush” refrain is purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of guilt, lullaby translation, and constellation cartography feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking (haunted firmware, time-folding dusk) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the fantastical: antique cabinet as payment, insect in amber. No close echoes of famous scenes; the premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
