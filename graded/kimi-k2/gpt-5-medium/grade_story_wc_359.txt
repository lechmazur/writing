<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception is embodied in every beat, guiding micro-choices (“tasted cedar, salt, mint, and bruised peach”); the sculptor’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters tactics. Interior contradiction surfaces when doubt about the city’s noise economy intrudes, but the final renunciation of that world is more asserted than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpted hush is released into common air, reweighting global noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bell pulse and chisel tap thickens pattern until the aurora stills. Cost is legible in the bell ringer’s departure and the irreversible diffusion of wonder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice cavern’s mineral silence and auroral light actively meter the performance; the bronze bell and marble block constrain every gesture. Final image of the hush diffusing into “common air” recharges the setting as a new atmospheric standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is tested by each bell strike and chisel tap, tightening until the hush is released. Agency is collaborative; the cost is the irreversible surrender of the artifact to the world, foreclosing any commercial repossession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory praxis: wonder is not declared but sounded, carved, tasted. The final auroral curtain of “pale gold” offers a non-literal answer—wonder becomes atmospheric, no longer ownable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmically controlled; patterned elision (“oscillating repose like an anchored buoy”) is taught early and paid off in the final tide-like exit. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined to the synesthetic lens. One minor loop—“slow, sure, oscillating repose carried in their spines like a tuning fork”—slightly echoes earlier phrasing, preventing a perfect 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthetic bell-ringing with marble sculpture to birth an audible absence is a fresh synthesis; risk is high yet coherence absolute. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight and transforms the trope of “art as gift” into atmospheric re-calibration.</comment>
