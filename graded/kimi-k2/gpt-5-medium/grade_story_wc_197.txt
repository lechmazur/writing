<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet clerk persona and buried rebel core are embodied in every micro-choice; the moment she pockets the key and later hums “exactly as far as needed” crystallizes her earned, costly stance. Interiority is specific, tactile, and contradictory—fear and resolve coexist in the same breath. The final refusal of hero-brochure fame in favor of being “the hinge” is a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only a sliver of distance remains between performance and raw exposure, keeping it just shy of perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal chain—caption erasure → key retrieval → lagoon activation → museum captions “sweating”—is tight, legible, and irreversible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seam of memory is opened, the cost is the perpetual vigilance of “steady hum in the dark.” Orientation is swift; even lyric leaps are tethered to concrete cues (splintered floorboard, brass gone dull). No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<comment>The lagoon, half-swallowed maintenance box, and drifting moths are not backdrop but instruments: the box’s “singing hinge” literally enables the memory conduit, while the water’s metallic smell and mirrored streetlights constrain and guide Mara’s final stance. Spatial choreography is exact—fence, slope, reeds—without clutter. The auric shimmer under starlight charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring erased voices—tightens once: the key turns, the lagoon answers, the museum’s authority begins to quake. Agency is continuous; every beat (studying puddles, kneeling, speaking names) narrows options and raises stakes. The cost is the lifelong vigilance encoded in her final hum. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence-driven rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the friction between institutional forgetting and individual refusal; no character states the thesis aloud. The “tyranny of indifference” is dramatized through caption vs. lagoon ripple, not labeled. Final image—moths spelling “the stubborn grammar of people who refuse to vanish”—offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Complexity is preserved: the committee is not destroyed, only forced to coexist with truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “folding risk into routine like a note into worn denim” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final “coded, which is to say free.” POV remains intimate third, never slipping. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm beats, clipped fragments as the hinge lights sync to pulse. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. Occasional lyric excess (“penny metal and rain on paper”) is earned by pattern and never muddles causality. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final line “enough to let her reappear in herself” lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of telephone-company arcana, museum revisionism, and lagoon memory-tech feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes—rebel clerk, magical key—are transformed through tactile specificity and maternal code. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story could not be transplanted without collapsing its unique circuitry.</comment>
