<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s “rationally rebellious” stance is embodied in every micro-choice—winding the cog, chalking the walls, refusing the slogans—while interiority stays concrete (“the old ache rose from my throat to my skull”). The final renunciation of easy lies carries visible social cost as the three factions leave dampened and chastened.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (finding the cog, measuring floods, jamming the gates) links because/therefore to the climax. Closure is a decisive change—water recedes, old method re-asserts, narrator keeps the cog—paid for by the public exposure of the chalk data and the risk of factional retaliation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sewer strata, salt-etched waterlines, and barnacled gears are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the chalk marks on the wall literally guide the rescue. The micro-setting of the emergency wheel and silt-jammed gate constrains the final choice and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether ancient methods survive the new calendar—tightens when the three envoys demand the cog. Escalation is driven by the narrator’s agency: using the cog to wind the sluice, trading spectacle for lives, with the felt cost of antagonizing every faction at once.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the quiet victory of method over myth; no moral is stated, but the image of the cog biting into the ratchet reweights all prior talk of “purity” and “renewal.” Subtext resides in the dampened slogans on coat sleeves—ideology literally soaked by its own consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is abrasive calm incarnate: precise, sardonic, salted with aphorism (“not all rebellion is arson”). Syntax and diction remain consistent under pressure; the final sentence’s clipped cadence crystallizes the stance without slipping into sermon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clutter. The metaphor “tooth from time itself” is earned by the closing bite of the cog into the wheel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Post-plague drowned-city scavenger philosophy is fresh, yet the piece avoids novelty for its own sake; the synthesis of tide clock, chalk flood marks, and factional politics feels inevitable. Risky compression and lyric layering pay off in the resonant final image.</comment>
