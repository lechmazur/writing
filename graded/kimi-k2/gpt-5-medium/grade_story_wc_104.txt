<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and strategic, her chain a constant embodied cost; the moment she knots it as a sling crystallizes her vow. Flaw: the scavenger-enforcers remain faceless obstacles, so status pressure is thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara descends with seeds while the wall’s roar covers her—cost is the chain’s weight and perpetual exile. Causal chain from keys → trapdoor → vault is tight; only the arrow’s later wink feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The carnival’s dust-choked piano and ticket avalanche constrain movement and camouflage; the seed vault’s “rain held in jars” scent recharges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate futures via seeds—tightens when enforcers appear; Mara’s jamming arrow and shelf-tipping visibly narrow escape options. Cost is the chain’s perpetual drag and the risk of being hunted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of planting futures in ruin emerges through tactile seed packets and drought-colored thread; final image of “common miracle” reweights the rubble without moralizing. Subtext in the piano’s silent chord is deft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “dust freckles a forgotten upright piano” marries texture to POV. Rhythm modulates with danger—short percussive clauses under pursuit, longer breaths in the vault. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. Only minor loop risk in “staggering grace” refrain, but it earns its echo at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusing carnival detritus with clandestine agri-resistance feels fresh; the piano-bench cipher repurposes nostalgia as survival tool. Transformation test passes—this could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
