<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (reluctance vs. need) play out in real time. The final metamorphosis is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the loss of plain speech. Minor drift: “paradoxically steady” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator becomes a passage and the orchard hums. Cost is legible: the narrator forfeits voice and solitude. One micro-turn—accepting the seam beneath the ribs—tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard, moonlight, spices, and beasts form a coherent micro-setting that constrains choice (safe passage, metamorphosis). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the final image of dew inside apples recharges earlier motifs. Spatial choreography remains stable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via scent-conjuring and the reluctant metamorphosis. One decisive tightening: the choice to open the seam beneath the ribs, with visible cost (loss of human voice). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of love as transmutation emerges through spices, beasts, and the orchard’s arithmetic of grief. Subtext operates in gesture (half-hand on chest) and scent. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “a quiet star threaded through two throats.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntax mirrors the narrator’s shifting state. Distinct perceptual signature—spices as grammar, beasts listening with rumps—persists under pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with emotional peaks. Minor muddle: “reluctant as dawn behind a mountain” is slightly strained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar mythic elements (phoenix, orchard, resurrection) are transformed through spice-grammar and beast-witnesses. The metamorphosis into a scent-keeper feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (lyric compression, non-linear causality) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
