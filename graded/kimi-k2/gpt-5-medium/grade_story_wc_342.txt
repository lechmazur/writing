<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The face-blind portraitist is sketched with interior contradiction and embodied emotion. His cued choices—rubbing the coin, testing pigment limits—turn key beats. The affliction shifts into active filter, shaping tactics under pressure rather than backstory ornament.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the guild withholds the pigment, therefore the artist must find the hidden atlas; climax hinges on the coin’s indentations read as star map. Closure lands with visible cost—painting a sky that endures collapse—earned from prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Tree-trunk library is not scenery but tactical actor: its rings and grain guide coin placement, the hidden notch tolerances bend choice. Micro-setting constrains action and supplies the final image’s curved horizon, charging the mural’s survival under rubble.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—salvage the sky before the building dies—escalates through each test: pigment shortage, ring-reading, foreman countdown. Pressure tightens in one sustained crescendo; coincidence complicates (coin maps rings) but agency resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The guiding idea—discover limits—surfaces as literal process: testing pigment thickness, timing stillness, choosing horizon indigo. Theme is not a preach line; it emerges from how each action risks fracture, then accepts it as price for a surviving dawn.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Seamless lyrical compression under pressure: breath-thin glazes mirror held-breath countdown. Voice remains consistent, perceptual signatures (grain as shoulder confession) enforce POV. Elision is taught early and paid off in mural’s hum.</comment>

<comment>Each sentence does extra labor—coin ridges echo rings, glaze paths taught like note pulses. No loops, high density. Rhythm mirrors hush; costly clarity untouched by metaphors even in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Alliance of liminal space, pigment alchemy, and limit-testing portraitist feels inevitable. Fresh synthesis: face-blindness becomes method for tree-ring reading. No template safety—risk and clarity coexist, weaponizing stillness into sky that survives collapse.</comment>
