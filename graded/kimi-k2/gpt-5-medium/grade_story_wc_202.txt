<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“I tasted old resin”—and her micro-choice to speak the child’s name into the canvas is earned by the preceding sensory anchoring. The contradiction between her professional detachment and personal hunger for recovered names is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The felt cost—swallowing “two worlds”—is scaled to the length and forecloses anonymity for the child.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of naming reweights the painting and the market light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory accretion tightens until the canvas exhales. Cost is legible in the final image: the painter’s lowered eyes and the sailcloth tag tied to the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is anchored early and constrains choice: swaying bridges, glass chimes, and the painter’s stall all guide proximity and access. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that literally reframes the painting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—tar, iron, nets—filtered through the translator’s synesthetic craft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering an erased name—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightened when the lens reveals the hidden child. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer increases pressure until the name surfaces. The final act of writing the name on sailcloth forecloses the option of leaving the child anonymous, with visible cost to the painter’s detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the translator’s embodied labor: histories survive not in books but in pigment, fracture, and salt. The final image—the tagged canvas—offers a non-literal answer: remembrance is an act of repair, not possession. No moralizing; the resonance is carried by the sailcloth scrap and the painter’s nod.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in sensory precision; the translator’s perceptual signature—“the rope bridges sighed like flutes”—is consistent and character-specific. Patterned elision (“I drank nothing…”) is taught early and paid off in the closing swallow of worlds. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains intimate and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, action, and atmosphere without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“fissures spread like cartographies”—and serve the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; the final cadence slows appropriately for the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—translator of non-oral tongues using a lighthouse shard to read erased lives—synthesizes familiar motifs into a fresh, inevitable whole. The risk of lyric excess is balanced by concrete stakes and sensory grounding. The transformation test fails if any element is swapped; the lens fragment and the child’s name are irreplaceable.</comment>
