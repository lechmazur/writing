<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conductor’s motive—restore lost laughter—is clear and embodied through ritual action; interiority is vivid (“kisses the pull cord handle for luck and for forgiveness”). Yet the absence of on-page family members limits relational crucible; we infer rather than witness the cost to the household, capping depth at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each gust and echo thickens the emotional density until the final “repaired silence” reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; closure is a Charged Poise—laughter loosens floorboards, grief tips his hat—felt cost legible without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tunnel as amplifier/judge constrains tactics: “returns only what you dare to risk.” Sensory detail is selective—lint, oak, rain translated into cymbals—anchoring the lyric register while guiding choice. Micro-setting (pull cord, blower throats) doubles as charged objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover giggles—tightens via escalating sonic assault on silence. One decisive intensification: the mother’s stifled squeal swims back, becomes drumbeat. Cost is diffuse (reddened knuckles, exhausted engines) but legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief as occupant emerges through concrete ritual; no moralizing. Final image—conductor leaving with “repaired silence”—reconfigures meaning without statement. Subtext in the tunnel’s selective echo and grief’s unpaid admission enriches complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence and metaphoric density (“notes wobble like lanterns in fog”) remain controlled; no head-hop. Compression and elision taught early (“the echo chamber tunnel inhales…”) and paid off at closure. Voice modulation under pressure is precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density with rhythmic variation; figurative language is purposeful, never purple. Minor loop risk in repeated “macerate” and “mournfully eager” but each recurrence reweights stakes. No clarity artifacts at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—leaf-blower orchestra reviving laughter via echo tunnel—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if blower becomes generic instrument, proving specificity.</comment>
