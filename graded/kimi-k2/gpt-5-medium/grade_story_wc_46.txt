<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the protagonist’s renunciation of fire for tide-glass is earned through memory and tactile ritual. The final stance—offering gentle light without harm—carries visible cost in the brother’s absence and the village’s wariness. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garland’s soft hush reweights the village’s relationship to light. Causality holds via the polishing ritual → memory → offering sequence; cost is the brother’s exile and the protagonist’s perpetual vigil. No orientation debt; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and sea glass function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: tide dictates timing, glass dictates method, mist dictates the final diffusion of light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The polished ovals charge the final image by literally holding the grotto’s hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—replace dangerous fire with patient light—is signaled early and tightened once when the garland is hung. Escalation is accretive: each polished oval increases the village’s quiet acceptance. Cost is the brother’s absence and the protagonist’s solitary labor; no reversal, but a deepening that reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: gentleness as resistance to destructive speed. Subtext lives in gesture—tongue-warming glass, kelp stringing—never in statement. Final image of “stringed ovals peopled by dusk” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature is tidal, salt-bright, patient. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long breaths for memory, clipped fragments for polishing beats. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Patterned elision (e.g., “the old woman taught me”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, action, and memory. Metaphors are coherent—“zephyr bloom,” “milk into tea”—and serve the tidal lexicon. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing” zone) keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—sea glass, starlight, village fire—are transformed through tactile ritual and ethical inversion. The “safer star” redefined as patient reflection rather than flame feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of kelp fiber, tongue-warming, and rye-roof fire grounds the concept. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off.</comment>
