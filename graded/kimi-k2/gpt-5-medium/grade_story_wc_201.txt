<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"the tilt of my jaw," "muscle flinch and breath timing"—but the final renunciation (knotting the strap as boundary) is slightly under-motivated; the caretaker beat feels grafted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap becomes a boundary marker and the forest’s equations reweight the rule-set. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the ultraviolet scripture tightens from sensory overload to calibrated mercy. Cost is legible in the strap’s warmth and the caretaker’s nod.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but active constraint—letters bloom from scars, equations align with breathing. The strap and bark function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the mathematics of mercy—escalates through embodied pressure: each step tests the ratio of intention to harm. One tightening beat: knotting the strap forecloses further harm. Cost is visible in the forest’s dimming to “normal green.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as calculable threshold emerges from the ultraviolet equations and the strap’s boundary. No moralizing; the caretaker’s nod and the forest’s applause photosynthesize regret into calibration. Final image reweights prior violence without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“a color that does not exist until it touches scars”—with rhythmic control under pressure. No POV leakage; diction stays within the focalizer’s plausible lexicon. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“river inside wood”—slightly muddies, but clarity at closure remains intact. No loops or scaffold; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi body-mod, lyric eco-psychedelia, and moral calculus. The ultraviolet penance and proprioceptive enhancement feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
