<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“dimensionally homesick,” “little climates clinking”), but the guardian’s choices remain opaque; her pivotal decision to accept the narrator’s “willingness to wait” feels granted rather than earned through demonstrated stakes or conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator interiorizes the garden and leaves “by not leaving,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (“the day is thinner for a breath”). Causality is lyric-accumulative; the lens holds, though the guardian’s final nod is more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden, sundial, and mist are not mere backdrop; they constrain action (ice accepts a leaf, sundial’s shadow frozen) and charge the final image. Micro-setting—the pendant’s bead of dawn—functions as a tool that shapes the boundary negotiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—gaining permission to stay—tightens once when the guardian demands a gift and the narrator offers only “willingness to wait.” The cost is the sliver of breath taken by the bead, but the escalation is more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: friendship with uncertainty, the ethics of carrying rather than crossing. The final image of thresholds-as-books reweights earlier motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed, syntactically varied, and consistent in perceptual signature (“light pools like breath on glass”). No head-hopping; the guardian’s speech is distinct in cadence and diction, fitting her wolf-taught tenderness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are precise (“patient glint of captured motion”). Minor loop risk in repeated “interiorizing” phrasing, but each instance deepens meaning. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The feral library, frozen garden, and pendant-of-dawn synthesize familiar tropes into a singular vision. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by concrete stakes; the final “carrying thresholds like books” feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
