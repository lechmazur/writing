<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pseudonym-creator voice is richly textured and specific, with clear interior contradiction (yearning vs caution) and embodied micro-choices (kneels, traces, balances). Her final renunciation—keeping the envelope suspended—is earned as Charged Poise with visible emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mosaic, accumulative design: chalk codes → map → new alias build-up culminates in the withholding gesture that reweights meaning. The inferred Causal & Accumulative lens holds, and the closure beat (pausing above the slot) reconfigures options with felt tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Golden arcade provides sensory grounding that pressures choices (bench hiding spot, floor as “communal paper,” sun turning stone gold at closure). Body + clipboard as micro-settings evolve into charged tool for decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stakes—naming another to free them, risking their own safety—tighten when chalk clues force an active alias choice. The final pause narrows options and makes time a palpable cost before release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from literal margins: meaning hides in overlooked gestures; the chalk codes surface unseen truths. Final non-answer (unmailed letter) reframes the act of giving identity without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is consistent, lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control (“vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes”). Chalk-filtered focalization is maintained; no head-hopping or drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is muscular and compact: “skin memory” and “flock arranges itself” carry narrative weight without overwriting. No loops, jargon drift, or filter-verb clutter; sentences adapt to crescendo and breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>A synthesizing feat: chalk spy-game meets elegiac postal myth, producing a new emotional register. Old trope (coded street messages) is reinvented into quiet act of listening and un-naming that feels inevitable.</comment>
