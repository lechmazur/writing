<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; modest fearlessness threads choices and self-imposed limits. The croc-tooth relic and croc-bite memory anchor motive with felt cost. Final choice to stand aside and yield the woman to her own laughter is a renunciation earned by prior causality. The single POV handles contradictory impulses cleanly, but the secondary on-page presence of the river-crocodile vignette is brief and utilitarian, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gardener lets the freed laughter ascend, paying the price of solitary return. Drive lens held is Accumulative/Textural—each added voice deepens the pattern until the gorge itself breathes relief. Orientation and causality sustained across lyric transitions. Cost is visible in the final beat: “I stood aside... so strangers might someday hear the way forward.” Situational rather than causal turns suffice under lens rules.</comment>

<comment>Echo gorge is tactile and constraining; misaligned harp, limestone clefts, light coins on oil—all shape sound and movement. Crocodile tooth as micro-setting object recharges the final image. Spatial grounding clear within 120 words, yet no environmental choice constrains the closure beat enough for the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrate laughter into healing—is signaled early and tightened only once when the woman fears betrayal. Single meaningful deepening suffices under length rules; consequence lands in the gorge’s applause and the renunciation required of the collector. Agency remains centered on attention and yielding rather than a second physical turn.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete business of coaxing voices without explicit thesis. Final image of the tooth resting like “a compass pointing toward mercy” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; irony lingers about salvation being mutual. Subtext conveyed in gestures—open palms, withheld judgment, the leaving of a single string.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with gorge acoustics; “crooked chuckle,” “tuning fork wet with morning” are character-specific and precise. No POV leakage; interior voice consistent. Compression is taught through early fragmentary exposition and paid off. Only hairline slip: repetitive “hush”/ “modest”“modestly fearless” stem, flagged but minimal under closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>No loops or scaffold; high information density—“stone shifted... coins of heat” does triple duty. Metaphor is controlled rather than muddled. Small price: filter-verb stack “I realized the tooth had always been a compass...” late in beat, but clarity unharmed. Final image sentence is limber and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of harp confessional and death-as-laughter retrieval; trope transformed through sound and mercy. Crocodile midwife image turns genre cliché inside-out. Risky lyric accumulation pays off with conceptual repricing in final beat. Resists generic anywhere/anyone swap—voice and setting are inseparable.</comment>
