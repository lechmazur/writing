<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is anchored in prior failure—the village breach—but interiority remains filtered through poetic diction that occasionally obfuscates concrete stakes. Embodied emotion (“the bones beneath,” “scar more than a uniform”) grounds guilt well; a late micro-choice to lower the tempo on the flute signals earned re-pacing. A felt cost—the lost market, the returning murmurs—justifies the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration: the market’s faint return and the ravens’ acceptance function as a Charged Poise that reweights failure into stewardship. Causal sequence (breach→return→flute test→driftwood reprise→stitching the seam) remains legible. Lens is consistent accumulative/textural; denser silence and breath mark deepening rather than linear pivots. One waver: late arrival of the “why the seam slipped” explanation, a mild retrospective hiccup rather than scene causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range as micro-setting: terrain governs sound’s trajectory, stones “remember storms,” talus controls where driftwood holds shape; the abandoned fountain internalizes loss. Spatial choreography is airtight across one seam-crossing move. The 9+ gate met when landscape literally channels the flute note to the faultline to knit worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repairing the failed village threshold; pressure grows via flute note strain and ravens’ silent witnessing. Deepening—not multiple reversals—works: driftwood → flute tempo → fountain shadow → gentled re-weave. Visible price: abandonment empties the market first, then the breath-by-breath restoration re-obligates the keeper to ongoing weaving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: listening as threshold craft, humble tempo vs forced mastery, ravens as silent auditors. Final flute release offers non-verbal answer—restored tide-sound instead of moral. Avoids overt “lesson” by keeping the exchange between landscapes rather than explicit narrator summation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Controlled lyric compressions: “velvet against my ears and the bones beneath” compresses silence to corporeal sensation. Pattern of echo-laden metaphor holds; no register drift. POV retains perceptual signature: relic keepers notice varnish, varnished thunder, talus, reed memory of rivers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Muscular sentence-level tension—no loops, only purposeful repetitions like “breath matched its tempo.” Minor density spike mid-story (“ghosting... returned like breath against a window”) lands just under overload; does not blur closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a flute as loom shuttle, driftwood as map, ravens as post-catastrophe auditors. These inflections are particular to this voice; not swappable without collapsing frame. Risky modal compression (accumulative lyric) paid off in closure, not gimmick.</comment>
