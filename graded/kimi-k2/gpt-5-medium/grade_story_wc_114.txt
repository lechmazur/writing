<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the swallowed-lie metaphor anchors motive. The oracle’s peripheral awareness and fault-tolerance are shown through action (repairing barometer, soot line) rather than labels. The final renunciation—speaking the truth at the margin—earns its cost in shoulder tension and storm arrival. Minor slip: “diagnosis” label appears without embodied detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weather imagery and repeated gentian motif tighten toward closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—truth spoken at the margin while the scale ticks—felt cost in the body’s release and station’s shiver. Orientation is taught early via “rib of galvanized rooms.” No causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mountain station is tactile—galvanized rooms, anemometer lee, ice-core scale—and constrains balance exercises that alter stance. Weather is not backdrop but active pressure: storm arrival coincides with confession. Micro-setting (soot line on gentian) becomes fulcrum for emotional weight. One minor drift: “auroral sorrow” leans decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled in line 2 and escalates through balance test and soot-line ritual. One decisive tightening: speaking the lie aloud while the oracle watches tension leave shoulders. Cost is visible in bodily release and incoming storm. Agency remains with protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of swaying certainties emerges from weather instruments and bodily balance; never stated didactically. Final image—folded gentian with smudge as map—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in oracle’s silence and peripheral gaze carries more than dialogue. Avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers like storm-light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through post-fever sensitivity. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm beats, clipped fragments during balance test. No head-hopping; oracle’s speech is spare, distinct from narrator’s interior cadence. Compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors (stone star, capillary sea) are fresh and internally coherent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One strained phrase—“towers with tired knees”—momentarily jars but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of fault-tolerant oracle at weather station feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Synthesis of meteorology and grief yields fresh metaphorical logic. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Transformation test: story collapses if oracle or gentian is swapped.</comment>
