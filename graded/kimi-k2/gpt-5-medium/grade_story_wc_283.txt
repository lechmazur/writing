<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“hands smell of sand, resin”), but the shift from obedient apprentice to liberating oracle feels slightly under-motivated; the theft is confessed without visible consequence, softening the cost of the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the warehouse opens, the prophecy becomes clay in communal hands. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each button matched to a syllable tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amber warehouse, glass lungs, and sweating jar are tactile and atmospheric; the cliff-shadowed east doors physically constrain the final act of opening, charging the closure image with spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate the canyon’s voice from fate—is signaled early and escalates through the cataloging ritual; the tightening choice to open the warehouse forecloses the elders’ lock-like prophecy with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: prophecy as loom, not lock. The final image of “clay quick between the fingers of everyone” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer that reweights every prior button and echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“slow patience our elders called shared wisdom”) remains consistent. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the cadence shift at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“unearthed silence that remembers it once was thunder”) risks register drift yet stays within the narrator’s ceremonial lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The canyon-echo-as-paperweight, button-oracle, and hourglass-turner combine into a fresh mythic engine; the transformation of prophecy from lock to loom feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
