<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—discoverer vs. person—remains abstract; no embodied micro-choice shows the twin actually warping action. The final renunciation (“one hand letting go of the ledger”) lands as label, not dramatized cost. Still, the voice’s obsessive cataloging gives a consistent, idiosyncratic pulse that keeps the arc legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty jar planted above the heart reweights the premise—garden found by unsaying a name—cost is the twin self unclasped. Accumulative lens holds: each emerald-lit image thickens pattern rather than causal chain, final image crystallizes options. Orientation anchors (who/where) are taught by line 3 and pay off at closure, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Carnival ship, fog, and salt-furred prizes are filtered through an obsessive cataloguing gaze; every sensory pick is selective and stakes the quest. The emerald gleam mapping constellations on deck boards directly guides the walk downstairs—setting constrains path. Micro-setting (jar of damp soil) becomes the final planting site, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the garden—tightens when the voice demands unsaying names; each narrative thread spoken forecloses the twin discoverer. One meaningful deepening: soil poured onto palm, silence chosen, cost felt. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but density shift suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—identity traded for memory—emerges through recurrent unsaying and the empty jar; no moralizing statement. Final image of “whoever I would become” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext in “trapped freedom” tightens each time stillness is required, giving the abstraction visceral traction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct, baroque texture—”blissfully aberrant, like laughter in a chapel”—that stays consistent under pressure. Perceptual signature is obsessive, taxonomic, slightly antiquarian; no head-hop. Compression and elision (“the ship kept adjusting its corridors”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric density is high but patterned; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors—”compass needle resting on the lip of the world”—stay within the POV’s ornate register and do not blur causality. Rhythm modulates with stakes, accelerating into the final breath-planting beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The carnival-ship-as-memory-threshold feels fresh; garden of forgotten names accessed by unsaying is a non-obvious twist on nominal magic. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: final empty jar recharges every prior emerald gleam. Could edge higher if the twin chimera had sharper corporeal impact.</comment>
