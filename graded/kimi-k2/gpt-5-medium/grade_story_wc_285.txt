<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority is embodied and specific; the yarn needle as token/tool anchors motive. Relationship with Wren is a crucible that forces the final choice to “write over fear with motion.” Cost is felt when the palimpsest promise settles “like a cloak… warming the scars.” Minor slip: “closely attentive” is repeated label rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stitched map-sail becomes the new horse, reconfiguring the road from burden to breathing. Causal chain holds—promise → needle → stitching → crossing—without gaps. Fog-bound river crossing anchors who/where/when by line 3. One transition (ferry ride) is legible and tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fog, river, and ferry constrain every tactical choice; the yarn needle and stitched sailcloth function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“water slapped the hull like a dog too tired to fetch”). Spatial choreography is clean across ferry loading and unloading.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the palimpsest promise—tightens when the current tries to turn them; Wren’s touch steadies the ferry, forcing the coachman to trade hill-road patience for water-road patience. Cost is visible: the ancestral letters bleed through, refusing erasure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-and-return emerges from the palimpsest promise and the stitched map; no explicit moralizing. Final image—“the hills looked less like burdens and more like breathing”—offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in gesture: Wren’s palm steadies the ferry, wordlessly shifting power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “spindrift serenity,” “yarn needle bright as a gull’s cry.” POV remains tightly focalized through coachman; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“You look like rain”). Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm breathes with ferry motion. Minor mixed metaphor “thread what you see through what you cannot” is brief and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: coachman mythology meets textile cartography. Palimpsest promise and yarn-needle stitching transform familiar crossing trope into tactile ritual. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure remains legible.</comment>
