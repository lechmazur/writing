<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present ("grief knotted us tighter") and embodied, yet the leap to accepting donor memories feels under-motivated in-scene; emotional specificity dips into therapy-speak ("I would carry what did not belong") and Mira feels summarized rather than pressured. The final nod "blessed them" earns the score without reaching full earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the monitors echo the rhythm and widen crack; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor waiver for Orientation: the opening line anchors by ~45 words, location inferred early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sound wave garden serves as micro-setting: rails, resonance beds, leaf-speakers, auric lagoon all press on choices and frame the final image; spatial arcs are coherent. Strong sensory bias; minor generic drift in "old stars pulsing."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes signal early ("bridge of love") and pressure deepens through the choice to tap donor memories with felt cost of "brine violin" weight. One tightening beat when monitor echoes rhythm counts; coincidence (synchronized heart rates) only complicates, not resolves. Escalation legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory as necessary entanglement instead of cure emerges from concrete scenes ("garden translated noise into a bridge"); no single moral stated. Subtext operates in gesture—fingers on railing, nods. Slight drift to thematic echo: "we would honor the after by learning its music".</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-poised, distinctive compression ("ribs hollowed like flutes", "light tasting of unread letters"). Pattern of repetition ("drumming on everything") taught early and paid at ending. No unmotivated POV leakage; psychic distance controlled through rhythmic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High information density in "thin crack where silence had been folded", "donors were inside us too"; minor over-writing in stacked metaphors ("stars leaning closer, their light tasting of unread letters"). Loop screen: zero paraphrase loops; clarity remains at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of sound as materialized bridge and memory spliced from donor strangers feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection in "lagoon threaded breath through wires and code." No close echoes; transformation passes the test.</comment>
