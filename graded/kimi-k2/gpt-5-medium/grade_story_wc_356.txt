<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the olfactory lens is consistent and character-specific. Motivation (“cultivate serenity within motion”) drives every beat, and the final renunciation into stewardship is earned by the cost of inhaling grief. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bridges steady, the village breathes together, and the narrator’s ambition softens into stewardship with visible cost (the lingering stink). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent, doodles, and sway tightens until equilibrium crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Treetop village is tactile—ropes, lanterns, cradle of air roots—and constrains every choice. The corpse-flower’s stink becomes micro-setting that steadies the bridges, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“motion itself had soured”—is signaled early and escalates through trembling bridges and panicked children. One meaningful tightening: planting the seed at the bridge’s heart. Cost is the communal endurance of the stink; agency is the narrator’s deliberate cultivation. No reversals, but pressure deepens under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: rot as road back to balance, grief as perfume. Final image of “wildflower hush” reweights prior dread into equilibrium without moralizing. Subtext lives in scent and doodles; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is olfactory and arboreal. Syntax mirrors sway and breath. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Patterned elision (e.g., “the tide’s thought”) is taught early and paid off at council.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, motion, and memory. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“smell unfurled, feral and cavernous”—and serve pressure. Minor elevation in register is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—using a corpse flower to still a swaying village—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (mystic herbalist, vanished elder) are transformed through olfactory specificity and arboreal physics. Risk in embracing rot as wisdom pays off in closure.</comment>
