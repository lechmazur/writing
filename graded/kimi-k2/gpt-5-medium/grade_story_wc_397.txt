<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from scheduled vanishing to listening-as-renunciation is credible. The parasol tip and whistle act as concrete extensions of motive. Minor drift: “Doctor Last-Minute” feels slightly external, not fully internalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the delayed appointment and final walk reconfigure the suicide plan into wandering/listening. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the perpetual deferral of oblivion. One micro-turn (storm veering) tightens stakes without breaking pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is tactile, atmospheric, and constrains every choice—sound carries, ice gives way, rope remembers. The parasol tip and whistle function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather is causal, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn to hear endings without surrendering—escalates through each rescue and the storm’s near-miss. Agency is attention and readiness; cost is the unclosed appointment. One deepening: the child’s whistle reweights silence from lure to warning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-survival emerges organically; no moralizing. The final image of “endings arriving and passing” reweights earlier suicide plan without statement. Subtext in rope memory and gullish whistle carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in sensory detail; perceptual signature distinct (“windborne solace brushing ribs from within”). Patterned elision taught early and paid off. Dialogue sparse but natural; Erland’s idiom contrasts with narrator’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pressure beats. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses during rescue, longer breaths at dusk. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) stays within narrator’s arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Euthanasia-tourist-turned-listener is fresh angle; parasol tip as ice-probe and memory shard is specific invention. Synthesis of disaster relief, drift-ice acoustics, and suicide delay feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
