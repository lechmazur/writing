<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s “patient jaw” and tactile attention to the rope splice anchor motivation. The final choice—to ring the bell softly instead of triggering sirens—earns its cost through prior micro-choices and the embodied warmth/cold of the rope. Reni functions as pressure, but her arc is slight; still, the narrator’s stance crystallizes with felt restraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single bell-pull reconfigures the valley’s response and the storm’s path under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but legible—listening accumulates until it alters weather and human behavior. Cost is visible in the narrator’s deliberate restraint and the splice’s invisible glue holding memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The sanctuary’s glass floor, cathedral rope, and braided wind function as micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective—temperature of rope, hush of solstice—filtered through the tester’s professional bias. The rope’s warmth/cold duality charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to warn or listen—tightens once when the corridor stalls and the bell is chosen over sirens. Escalation is atmospheric but coherent under Accumulative lens; the cost is the audible restraint that replaces blaring decisiveness. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as civic responsibility versus noise as panic. The bell’s soft vowel reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of “bless the dark” offers non-literal resonance, crystallizing the conceptual shift from verdict to witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Voice is distinct—meteorological precision braided with liturgical cadence. Perceptual signature is consistent: pressure quarrels read as “hesitant handwriting,” rope “remembering hands.” No head-hopping; Reni’s dialogue is spare and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure, peaking in the bell’s three rings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“empty lung,” “iron mouths”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor register drift toward the lyrical is voice-motivated and consistent. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-warning infrastructure reimagined as monastic listening post. Bell rope as memory-vein transforms familiar trope. Risk in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity of microclimate tracking and ferryman lore anchors originality.</comment>
