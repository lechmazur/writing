<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—"mossy delight," "ash sifts like sugar"—but the character’s contradictory impulses (delay vs. eager reach) are more asserted than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of haste is earned by prior ritual pacing and carries visible cost: “laughing under the generous ashen sky” shows altered stance. Still, the voice edges toward lyrical self-diagnosis rather than raw contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decoded phrase “Emerges transformed always” reconfigures the arbor’s conversation and the sorter’s role. Causality is accumulative/textural—each leaf placement tightens the pattern until the final architecture of monuments crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored early by the arbor’s floating roots and lichen understory; no drift. Cost is legible in the cooled moonstone and the dawn descent “newly arranged.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The arbor itself—ash-gray bark, cloud-braided roots, lichens sipping thunder—functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: leaf placement, monument building, final descent. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; professional attention to “veined script” and “sparrow skull cairn” guides spatial choreography. Final image of ash “like sugar” recharges the setting’s agency. No white-room drift; geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decoding prophecy without haste—tightens once when the sorter delays the reach, then again when monuments must ground the future. Escalation is pattern-deepening rather than causal reversal; each leaf’s landing narrows interpretive options. Cost is felt in the cooled moonstone and the dawn’s altered self. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from ritual action: memory anchors future, listener not leaf is transformed. Subtext operates in silence—leaves “choose neighbors,” monuments “hum”—avoiding explicit moral. Final birch-bark sentence fed to airstream reweights the premise without sermon. Complexity lingers: the arbor “seems to smile,” refusing judgment. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “cataloging breath and husk with mossy delight” fuses occupation and sensibility. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences for ritual, clipped “I do not prod” for restraint. Perceptual signature is consistent; moonstone’s warmth refracts “veined script” in character-bound lexicon. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or ritual logic. No loops or scaffold; “ash sifts like sugar” is singular and earned. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“filigreed stacks”) fits the arbor’s mythic register. Final line “laughing under the generous ashen sky” crystallizes rhythm and closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—skyborne memory-arbor tended by leaf-decoder—is non-obvious yet internally coherent. Folklore of cranes and spared ember is transformed into living ritual, not backdrop. Risk: lyric density could obscure, but clarity holds. Specificity of “nutshell and bone button” monuments anchors universals. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
