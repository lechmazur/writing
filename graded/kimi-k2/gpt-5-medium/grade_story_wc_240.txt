<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—vigilance vs. hospitality—play out in micro-choices (hosting the cat, bracing the strut). The final renunciation of fear-based security is earned and carries felt cost. Kian’s memory is integrated without drifting into summary. Only the “spatially gifted” label feels slightly external.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the farm’s new permeable alert system and Mara’s lattice of letting-go crystallize in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers sensory density until the quiet wildfire reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the relinquished grip on certainty. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail that constrains choices (humidity paths, mesh gaps, steam hiss). The cracked laser pointer and breathing pipes function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach the farm (and herself) permeable vigilance—is signaled early and tightens through each sensor recalibration. The cat’s low-threat anomaly forces a stance crystallization; the hiss of steam demands immediate embodied cost. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, and lands with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of permeable security emerges organically from action and image; no moralizing. The final lattice image reweights the premise without statement. Grief’s membrane vs. wall motif threads through particulars (Kian, cancer, cat). Resonance lingers in the quiet wildfire that reshapes without destroying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to spatial melody and fungal light. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Compression (“light as a falling permission”) is taught early and paid off. Register remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor scaffold (“she had come to teach…”) is offset by immediate sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of bioluminescent farm, intrusion detection, and grief-work feels inevitable in hindsight. The permeable-barrier security concept is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
