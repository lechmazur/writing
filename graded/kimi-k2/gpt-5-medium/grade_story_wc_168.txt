<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied cost are vivid—his “hard softness” and the cracked box as “fragile second heartbeat” externalize guilt. The mother’s arrival crystallizes a status shift: he relinquishes custodianship of the children, a choice that costs him the last token of his “bargained innocence.” Micro-choices (offering the box, repairing the paper hand) reveal a hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-labeling. Only the mother’s interior remains slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty box becomes lighter than guilt yet heavier than air, reweighting the bargain. Causal linkage holds—he carried the box because he could not bear her walking without it; she accepts it only after they jointly repair the chain. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of heat-cracks, ash, and paper children intensifies until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, wind that “arrives honest and leaves with nothing,” and the stone’s warmth are selective, purposeful details that constrain tactics—he uses the stone to set paper without flame. The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, its brittleness guiding how it is handled. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a firefighter notices ash-scent and resin over perfume. Final image of the empty box recharges earlier setting cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translating pain into legible form. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary bearing of the box to joint repair and future communal teaching. Cost is visible—he forfeits sole guardianship and accepts ongoing obligation (“meet children at the library”). Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure tightens when the mother refuses to touch the box until they open it together.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the act of repair: pain translated not into universal platitude but into shared, fallible practice. Subtext lives in gesture—her looking at his scarred hands first, the paper children breathing “thin, ash-scented breath.” Final image offers non-literal answer: the empty box as vessel now communal. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the phrase “pathway with milestones.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “porcelain making a brittle music inside his shirt.” Compression taught early—“the valley burned like a sentence unfinished”—and paid off in closure. Perceptual signature is firefighter-specific: “maps of roads that only end at rivers.” Dialogue carries subtext without voice convergence. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs—“He seated himself on a stone, breath making small fogs, and waited, counting meteors and inhaling pine” advances action, atmosphere, and interiority. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and precise. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial bodies, unhurried, exact, ancient as breath”) fits the reflective frame. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—firefighter returning charred paper children—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes of guilt and restitution are transformed through tactile repair ritual. Specificity of resin, ash-scent, and cracked glaze anchors universals. Final reconfiguration of the bargain into shared teaching is fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
