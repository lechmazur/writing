<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory hunger vs humility drives every beat. The child’s plea and the final refusal to publish crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “teacher” label feels slightly external, not fully earned by prior action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each landing thickens pattern until the lake-image reweights all prior visions. Closure is a Charged Poise—“we could be altered”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; disorientation is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive, pagoda, mirrors, and compass are tactile, selective, and evolve with pressure. The bronze prism pagoda literally folds space and later folds back, constraining ascent/descent. Micro-setting (compass in palm) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to feel honestly—tightens when the narrator refuses to bargain for purity and later refuses to publish. Each refusal forecloses a path with visible cost (loss of safe bread, loss of citation). Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of responsible love emerges through concrete refusals and the final image of lantern seeds. No moralizing; resonance arises from the lake releasing folded centuries. Final line reweights premise without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice—saffron-veil, drought-hunger, twilight as verb—remains controlled under pressure. Patterned elision (“twilight was a verb”) is taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and never clutters closure. Occasional stacked metaphors (“atoms of nostalgia practicing breath”) flirt with excess but are justified by taught lyric mode. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-as-living-river and knowledge-as-permission feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (compass pointing to yesterday’s mistake) transform familiar tropes.</comment>
