<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete and embodied—e.g., “ribs clatter like thin cups”—and her micro-choices (placing the stone, tracing softened cracks) visibly alter the cave’s state. Motivation stays consistent: find quiet before maps collapse. The final renunciation—closing the petal and marking the corridor—costs her the immediate shelter she just created, earning the change. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “bloom of hush” opens and then closes, leaving the mapkeeper with a new tool and the beings with “gentler syllables.” Cost is legible—“the glow thinned from milk to water”—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early by sensory cues (“harmonic caves,” “comet-lit gulf”). One minor ellipsis: how the stone’s coolness translates to stillness is implied rather than shown, but it does not rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caves function as both setting and instrument: arches become bells, ice fractures guide listening, the corridor’s low song steadies under the stone. Specificity is selective—“calcite rib,” “rounded scripts”—and every detail constrains choice. The echo chamber stone itself acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the quiet before our maps break”—is signaled early and tightened when the beings’ choruses threaten resonance collapse. The single deepening occurs when the mapkeeper plants the bloom, trading immediate safety for future shelter. Cost is visible in the thinning glow and the closed petal. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between resonance and silence: storms are not erased but given “rooms to pass through.” The final image of the mapkeeper leaving with a warm stone and a new mark reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the beings’ “softening” and the softened ice scripts. No thematic drift; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“hammered repose,” “weather finally named”—and the perceptual signature is consistent throughout. Compression and patterned elision (“I told them without words”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythm accelerates during the planting sequence and breathes during the resting aurora.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is selective—“milk to water,” “blue to the tongue”—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor filter verbs (“I felt their relief”) are voice-motivated and brief. The final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of acoustic ecology, alien energy beings, and cartographic mysticism feels inevitable and fresh. The “bloom of hush” is not a gimmick but a functional tool that reweights the premise. Specificity—“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “echo chamber stone”—anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
