<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—“emotionally rational” trait shows in micro-choices like copying names “exactly as the heat forgot them.” The final renunciation (truth over mercy) is earned, but the stationmaster’s trembling hand is reported rather than embodied, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian’s act of writing “Listen” under the gilded L crystallizes the new stance. Causal chain holds—rose’s end → ledger → copying names → public reckoning—though the leap from ledger to town-wide publication is slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is tactile and constrains movement; the gilded L and soot-coughing lockers anchor the scene. Micro-setting (ledger margins, compass needle) directly shapes choices. Final image of seeds “like shy reporters” recharges the motif without over-symbolizing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. town peace—tightens when the historian chooses to publish. Cost is legible: the stationmaster’s “trembles” and the historian’s acceptance of possible backlash. One clear escalation suffices, but the external pressure (army demand) is off-stage, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: noble lies as medicine that “tastes like sleep.” The final act of writing “Listen” reframes the ledger from evidence to elegy. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the town’s unread reaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, archival, yet lyric (“ivy whispering memory across brick”). Syntax mirrors the historian’s precision; no head-hop. Compression like “the schedules ran on secrecy” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each image does double duty (“throat of shadow” conveys both architecture and menace). One mixed metaphor—“ledger meant to be devoured”—is minor. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-industrial gothic meets archival ethics. The illuminated L in a railway ledger is a non-obvious icon that reweights meaning at closure. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring stakes.</comment>
