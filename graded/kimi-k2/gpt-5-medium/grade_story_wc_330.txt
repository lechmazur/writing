<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices—pressing the halo to the horse, timing breath with bells—yet his contradictory impulse (silent by trade, compelled to sing) is dramatized only once. Motivation is consistent but the cost of breaking silence feels under-weighted; the final vow to “tend the reservoirs of quiet” is more stated than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the carousel turns by consent, not mechanics, reweighting the premise from repair to shared stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (mist, bells, oasis) thickens until the final image crystallizes. Cost is visible in the carpenter’s relinquishment of sole authorship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop; the breached water tank and wind bells actively constrain tactics and supply the literal voice the train “thirsted” for. Micro-setting—the halo orbiting a bubble—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; every object’s position is traceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring motion—tightens when mechanical failure forces a non-engine solution. The deepening is the discovery that the train needs voice, not power; the cost is the carpenter’s surrender of anonymity. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges through concrete acts: sanding wood, routing slots, singing. The final image—carousel turning by communal breath—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the halo’s glow and the child’s touch carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the carpenter’s patient, haptic attention. Syntax modulates with pressure—“threading the hiss of the oasis the way a needle tames unraveled cloth.” No head-hopping; focalization is airtight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“lantern made entirely of listening”). One minor loop—“quietly persistent” appears twice in close proximity—dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus train as resonant instrument, the halo fragment as crown, the oasis as hidden larynx—each transforms familiar tropes into a fresh synthesis. Risk in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
