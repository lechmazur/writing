<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arsonist’s motive—burning the library to protect readers—drives every beat; the contradictory impulses (destructive act for preservation) are embodied in the tactile handling of soot and seeds. Micro-choices (aligning tapestry to canvas, stitching the throat) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—carrying the portrait “like a shield”—earns its weight through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seeds sprout into a living sentence that reweights the ruin as a vow kept. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each painted bird, mosaic scale, and threaded name layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. The cost (arson as primer for new writing) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive’s stone halls, broken oculus, and salt-shivering murals constrain movement and supply the seeds’ planting site. Spatial choreography is clean: the corridor overlay guides descent, the atrium’s wind channels the sprouting filaments. Environment charges the final image by literally writing the names across the floor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the forgotten promise to hidden readers—tightens when the ledger of names appears. One meaningful deepening: realizing the promise extends to the dead city. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (torching, stitching, planting) with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of destruction as preservation; the final living sentence offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the slashed throat revealing graphite rivers, the seeds writing gratitude. The portrait becomes a shield, not exhibit, crystallizing the vow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet precise—“heart steaming with volcanic tenderness” teaches the tonal pattern early. Perceptual signature is consistent: analytically intuitive noticing patterns in dust and soot. No head-hopping; syntax modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—“seeds opened like small eyes, sprouting filaments that wrote across the floor”—with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, never muddled. Rhythm accelerates during descent and breathes during planting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of arson-as-primer, tapestry-as-map, and seeds-as-language feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking (using destruction to enable creation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
