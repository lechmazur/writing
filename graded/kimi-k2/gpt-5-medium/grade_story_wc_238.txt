<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt and self-loathing drive every micro-choice. The apology is dramatized through the séance-like ritual, not declared. The final “Play” choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the column sacrificed, the orchard still doomed. Minor slip: the “gossip-column exorcist” label is asserted more than demonstrated in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stylus writes “Play,” the narrator obeys, and the cost—public exposure of sources, probable career suicide—is legible. Causal chain holds: apology → séance → column offer → stalled truck → shared nocturne. Orientation is swift; no disorientation penalty. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until only the imperfect music remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archive’s dust, the orchard’s held breath, and the rewired perfume bottle all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: jasmine and iron filings, peaches and static. Spatial choreography is clean; the piano, bottle, and stylus track without drift. One hairline slip: “summer and storm” edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology and earn forgiveness—tightens when the stylus demands action, not absolution. Agency is active: the phone call to the foreman is a decisive escalation that forecloses safe retreat. Cost is visible: the column’s publication will end the narrator’s career. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the stalled truck is a rumor’s mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges from the séance’s static-laced nocturne and the orchard’s impending loss. No moralizing; the final image of “peaches and iron filings” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the ghost’s peach-and-treble-clef sketch is earned. Thematic resonance lingers in the unresolved chord of survival and betrayal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, noir-lyric, with controlled compression: “dust sang under my shoes as if the floor were a throat.” Metaphor density is high but patterned and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal yet subtext-rich: “Forgive” and “Play” carry full emotional load.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, each sentence advancing stakes or texture. No loops or scaffold; “jasmine and old rain” is specific, not purple. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“the stylus began to creep”—then breathes at closure. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” is academic diction outside the narrator’s lexicon, but it appears only in the meta-commentary, not the story proper.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—“gossip-column exorcist” who literalizes rumor via radio magic—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes of ghost séance and orchard elegy are transformed through tech-noir detail and ethical stakes. The final synthesis—imperfect miracle of music over loss—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (electromagnetic ghost-writing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
