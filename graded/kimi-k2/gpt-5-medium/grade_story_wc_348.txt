<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chemist’s guilt and scientific ear are inseparable. The chrysalis test (“it answered by not cracking”) crystallizes a micro-choice that foreshadows the polymer design. Motivation (translate separation into connection) is dramatized through river observation and final sketch. Only slight over-articulation of “I realized” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chemist’s stance shifts from penance to active redesign, cost is the acceptance of lawsuits and scorn. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—cadence of river braids reweights the stakes. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the chrysalis enters the notebook) is forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ravine, foam, chrysalis, and damp boots are rendered with tactile specificity; braided channels physically constrain the insight cadence. Final image of “boots still damp” carries the setting into the city, charging closure. Weather and river dynamics mirror internal state without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing ecological and familial rupture—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: river foam patterns become the tempo model that redefines polymer design. Cost is explicit: “lawsuits and scorn.” Agency remains high; no coincidence resolves. Slight reserve because the external antagonist (company) is off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending through listening emerges from foam cadence and polymer reversibility, never stated. Subtext in “my name gleamed on patents” versus “the birds would not bleed.” Final image of gradual softening like rain on clay offers non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is scientist-poet: “polymer chains whisper curvature” yet “shredded into barbed tatters.” Syntax mirrors river rhythm—long braided sentences, then abrupt breaks. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact. Compression (“I sketched a copolymer…”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or insight. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is patterned (river motifs) and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “I thought about departures that are also arrivals” could trim, but does not dull closure. High information density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer science + river acoustics + ecological penance. Chrysalis as reversible-ring metaphor is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative premise; lived specificity prevents template drift. Transformation test: story collapses if chemist is swapped for generic seeker.</comment>
