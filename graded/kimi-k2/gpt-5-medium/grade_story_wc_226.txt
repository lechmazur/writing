<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Artist’s interior contradiction—questioning the ritual while participating—drives every beat; the gold-for-memory sacrifice lands as earned cost. Child’s mischief refracts the debt and re-mentors the artist, a credible micro-turn. Mentor backstory is anchored to present touch of bone tower, not summary. Motivation stays legible, though “refract truth” remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: communal color-payment rewrites the ritual rule-set on the page. Causal chain—poetry sessions → braid of stories → canyon’s counter-offer → artist doubles the price—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is swift; canyon, spire, and mist are fixed by line 3. No late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and bottle-shard necklace constrain choices: the necklace refracts light to cue the final dispersal of cost; the spire literally absorbs hues. Sensory selection is urgent—dust, vibration, mist—filtered through artist’s guilt. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from margin of mist to foot of spire.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“price of forgiveness”—tightens when canyon demands per-speaker tribute, forcing artist to double-pay. Escalation is causal: each poem adds a voice, each voice a color, each color a visible forfeiture. Child’s rhyme about the dog/clock crystallizes the moral calculus without softening it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid: forgiveness is not silence but wind that goes forward—earned by communal surrender of private hues. Subtext lives in gesture: child tapping the empty jar re-weights the mentor’s earlier silence. No final moralizing; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “the canyon listened like a judge who had set down the gavel” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under ritual tension, longer braid-lines during poetry. No head-hopping; child’s speech is distinct in cadence and diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “vibration climb the palm like a warning” performs triple duty—sensation, foreshadowing, metaphor. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“forged hush”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms ritual-forgiveness trope into communal chromatic debt; bone towers and bottle shards feel invented, not borrowed. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final non-echoing breeze. Specificity—gold of mentor’s last morning—anchors universality.</comment>
