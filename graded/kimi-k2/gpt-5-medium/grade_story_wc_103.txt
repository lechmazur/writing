<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the designer’s grief and curiosity are palpable through tactile detail. Motivation—“to discover the texture of time”—drives every beat, but the final acceptance feels slightly abstract rather than earned by a concrete choice. Micro-choices (licking the shard, stepping onto the submerged bridge) show hierarchy of values, yet the woman’s role as pure interval keeps relational crucible off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ringed halo reconfigures the garden and the protagonist’s stance toward time’s fading. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of images and cadence shift carry the weight. Orientation is taught early via the shard’s effect; causality is lyric rather than linear, but the final image reweights all prior material with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Setting is not backdrop but active agent: bridges braid, pavilion breathes, vault of roots echoes choices. The halo fragment itself becomes micro-setting that constrains perception and action. Every sensory detail is filtered through the designer’s professional eye, charging the final submerged sentence with inevitability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to inhabit time’s texture—tightens through each recursive loop of the garden. Pressure grows via hyperbolic geometry’s endless curves, forcing the protagonist toward acceptance. Cost is felt in the library’s unburned books dissolving into birds; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief braided into living paths, time as both wound and aperture. Subtext operates in the reversed negatives of the woman’s eyes and the library’s reconstitution. Final image of the ringed halo laying a path offers resonant, non-moral answer—accept continual fading as texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is architect-poet: precise yet hallucinatory, every clause a measured angle. Syntax mirrors the hyperbolic curves—long sentences splay, then snap to fragment. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even under lyric compression. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each metaphor earns its keep (“bridges grow where footprints wish to be”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with emotional crests. Occasional elevated diction fits the designer’s lexicon. Final line blooms without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Premise—maze designer cultivating time through living bridges—is fresh, non-obvious. Hyperbolic geometry as emotional topology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure without gimmickry. Specificity of hedge-craft fused with mythic resonance avoids template.</comment>
