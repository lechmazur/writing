<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“porcelain cracks in her eyes”), micro-choices (taking only singed envelopes, mixing ash) align with motive, and the final wrist-squeeze shows earned cost. Relationship pressure with mother is present but mostly off-stage, limiting crucible effect. No unmotivated knowledge leaps; flaws complicate choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ash, mask, chair layers until the rocking reprise reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the chair’s final slow stop crystallizes the cost of surviving without witness. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>House, studio, gallery are sketched with selective sensory detail; the rocking chair as micro-setting constrains the final image and charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Light through skylight and draft that rocks chair are purposeful environmental pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to testify to danger without naming it—tightens through each beat: permission withheld, envelopes taken, ash scattered, visitors’ reactions. One meaningful deepening: the chair’s unbidden rocking under draft forces collective reckoning. Cost is visible in mother’s gray resolve and the ash jar she now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of safety as mirage emerges from concrete actions (kintsugi mask, powdered letters) rather than statement. Final image of chair rocking alone offers non-literal answer: danger survives in motion and silence. No moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “charcoal portrait ash scatterer,” “storm of names dissolving into faces.” POV remains intimate first-person; no head-hop. Compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich (“Take what you need”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Minor elevated diction (“somber marvel”) fits narrator’s curator persona and does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi ethics + forensic ash art + family silence. Risky structure—exhibition as climax—earned by accumulative texture. Specificity of singed envelopes and draft-rocked chair prevents template feel. Transformation test: story collapses if any named element swapped.</comment>
