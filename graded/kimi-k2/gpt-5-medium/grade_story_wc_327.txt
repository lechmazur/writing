<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storyteller’s interiority is vivid—copper-veined, quietly articulate, nameless after sacrifice—yet the renunciation of the travel-name feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is legible but not fully embodied in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist forfeits his name to the curse, the canyon becomes a living school, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—each echo-layer reweights the stake until texture sings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, echo-tunnel, and diamond niche are not backdrop but instruments: the canyon’s ribs tremble under touch, the tunnel swallows and returns voice, the niche shelters rain—setting actively constrains every tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage a dying language—tightens through escalating texture-to-sound translations; the final cost (loss of name) is visible, though the middle beats could sharpen the trade-off earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic afterlife emerges from stone, birds, and breath; no moralizing, only the resonant reprise of “the dead language learned to travel again,” reweighting all prior texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, mineral, and precise—“quietly articulate because the valley favors words that do not bruise the air”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure; no head-hop, no drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “wind stitched a grammar between wings and cliff” carries three jobs in eight words; zero loops, zero mixed metaphors, high read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of ornithography, lithic linguistics, and curse-contract feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the risk of lyric abstraction is embraced and paid off in the final concord of stone and voice.</comment>
