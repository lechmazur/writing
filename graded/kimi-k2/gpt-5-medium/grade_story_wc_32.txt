<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority (“stoically sensitive”) is enacted in every micro-move; the moment he presses scarred palm to ember establishes embodied empathy and resolve. Contradictory motives—self-definition vs. inherited obedience—remain simultaneous under pressure. Final breakage of the crozier crystallizes foreclosed path with visible cost (palmskin, burnt staff). Single POV keeps traits coherently singular throughout; no relationship friction needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density rises, pattern breaks to Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Closure hinges on the hinge-metaphor: the crozier reed-hum reweights stakes, cost is scarred palm, ashes “sighed”. Orientation clear by 100 w: “ember nexus at twilight”. No causal break—each approximation tightens under furnace breath. Final image “gate… open” is legible before/after moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory economy selects heat-sink smells and “warm pennies” filtered through alchemist perception. Furnace, ash, and crozier body serve as micro-setting that constrains choice—proximity to coals determines tactics. Twilight and penny-glow set cadence tone change. No anchor drift; spatial choreography around grate and column is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: interrupt the stifling destiny. Progressive tightening: crozier packed, rolled, soaked, snapped—each step narrows future (salt, hair, palm). Final break forecloses bishop pathway; cost is real palmskin and lost authority sigil. Escalation under Accumulative lens; no resolution via luck—agency owns the act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges from action—dismantling authority becomes literal furnace fuel. Subtext reframes loss as room-making; no final sermonizing. Bishop memory, frost-flower lens—all reweighted at close via blade-of-light image. No thematic statement overrides earned material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early with “ashes breathe out” and kept consistent. POV remains tightly wound inside alchemist perception with perceptual signature: notices air as “warm pennies”. Patterned elision (“hoarse music”) is coherent. No dialogue, no violations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies with furnace bellows; each line carries sensory and causal load. No scaffold lines; no repetitive stems. Mixed metaphors avoided—embolus of heat, reeded crozier both specific and coherent to world physics. Palmskin cost described in one sharp tactile image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Trope of broken clergy relic transmuting into hinge-gate—specific, grounded, unforeseeable yet inevitable. Fresh synthesis of apprenticeship rebellion via metallurgical metaphor. Risk-take succeeds without obscuring clarity; final light-blade image is non-obvious payoff.</comment>
