<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—empirical duty vs. inherited grief—braid through micro-choices (turning off the radios, keeping the lantern). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern’s return reweights the entire investigation from “case closed” to “lesson carried.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory layer tightens until the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (salt-crusted drains, dead third rail) constrains every beat; the lantern itself becomes portable setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities and grief-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional erasure—tightens through escalating sensory density and the narrator’s refusal to capitulate. One decisive tightening: turning off the radios forecloses the easy closure demanded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: collective risk vs. individual obedience. The lantern’s reprise offers a resonant, non-literal answer—some light belongs to use—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: forensic precision braided with lyric grief. Syntax mirrors the tunnel’s hush and the narrator’s controlled breathing. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>High information density; every sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Occasional figurative layering (“white teeth of thirst”) stays purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise—drowning without flood—feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh synthesis of historical artifact, bureaucratic violence, and personal legacy. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
