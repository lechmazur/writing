<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tender keeper’s interiority and embodied silence work beautifully; the contradictory impulse—“returning to teach suffocating to breathe”—plays out in the scar-tissue linkage with the girl, yet the trait “burns bridges carefully” is asserted more than it drives live tactics in the final beats, shaving a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the final moment of Earned Stasis crystallizes options; threshold steadies, girl exits unescorted, keeper stands alone with doorknocker cooled. Cost is felt in the exhalation of the night and the keeper’s last line “prepared my scars,” though the causal hinge from linkage to lesson is slightly diffuse under an accumulative design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>‘Ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight’ remains a lived, constraining micro-setting; no props teleport; every tool (door, ring, ash, crater) is physically rehandled and constrains the next move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is “teaching the girl to breathe without apology”; pressure tightens once when the girl’s gaze seeks permission to vanish and the keeper denies by stillness, then a cadence shift as the girl steps through unescorted. Cost is visible (keeper left alone scar-ready), sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship through necessary absence surfaces without sermon: bridges burn as care, smoke shapes are owed a passage, and the final image—“behind me the ashes stayed bright enough to read”—reconfigures loss as maintenance. No moral line is spoken, only enacted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular, lyrical yet precise; rhythmic modulation accelerates on “count the seconds between fear and breath,” then settles into the hush again. Free indirect texture stays locked to the keeper; no drift in tense or lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Compression is dense; only two faint scaffolds—“ashen charcoal sanctuary” + “loaded emptiness” in adjacent sentences. Sensory layering is purposeful, no mixed metaphors. Closure beats keep clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a scar-linked pedagogy of absence set inside a door without a house. Bridge-burning as stewardship offers a non-obvious moral calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring legibility.</comment>
