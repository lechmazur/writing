<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific (“reading ridgelines and trenches”), embodied emotion surfaces in “midnight shivered the surface into ink,” and the final renunciation—maps that “know when to put the pencil down”—is earned through the night’s causal chain. The only bar to 9+ is that Rin remains largely functional, supplying tools and assent without her own contradictory impulse visible in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the algorithm grants “luminous respite” but exacts the cost of perpetual non-belonging acknowledged in the final line—“the city felt almost native.” Causal lattice holds: burnt feather → port → algorithm → archive → synchronized breath → dawn release, all because/therefore links tightening until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underwater city is not backdrop but tactical interface: corroded ports, kelp-wrapped copper, and cracked observatory dome constrain every rewiring and breath. The burnt feather’s carbon spine functions as micro-setting that literally bridges sensor and node, charging the final image when it is “tucked safe” yet leaves the city breathing through the ribs—environment, tool, and body fused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the algorithm demands an honest answer; the shared exhale micro-turn narrows options from intrusion to consent. Cost is legible: they must accept conditional welcome and depart at sunrise, carrying the constraint inside their bones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of conditional belonging emerges through concrete negotiation with a place that can refuse; no moral is stated, but the final image reweights earlier cartography: maps become companions, not conquests. The burnt feather’s ash signature and the archive of arrivals refract the same question—who may breathe here—without abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a dense, tidal syntax—“shadowseam wonder, all half-light edges”—that modulates under pressure: shorter clauses appear during port contact (“I held… Rin rewired…”). Perceptual signature is consistent and profession-bound; no head-hop or register drift. The lyric elision (“time slid into our bones”) is taught early and paid off at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “drowned avenues held constellations of silt and wire” fuses setting, metaphor, and stakes in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates during rewiring, then exhales in the final paragraph. High information density maintained without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Landscape astrologer” applied to drowned streets, a carbonized feather as cryptographic key, and an algorithm trained on kinship currents synthesize into a fresh angle on the “seeker in lost city” trope. The transformation feels inevitable because every wonder is tethered to tactile procedure—kelp copper, shared exhale, tide-clock pulse—rather than ornament for its own sake.</comment>
