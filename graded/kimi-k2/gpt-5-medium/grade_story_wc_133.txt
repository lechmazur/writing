<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia and need to “thresh meaning” drive every micro-choice; the moment he pockets the brooch and later relinquishes the gnat crystallizes a visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“paint became the only clean water I trusted”) and contradictory impulses (keep vs. return) act simultaneously in scene. The keeper’s grief and the mother’s apparition pressure a joint renunciation that alters their shared stance. Only the keeper’s backstory drifts into summary, keeping this just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brooch’s return and the gnat’s release reweight the island’s pact under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but legible—each rain trail, seam, and apparition accumulates until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is swift; the tidal island and post-war frame are anchored by concrete cues within 120 words. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal island is not backdrop but agent: rain trails steer movement, the seam of peat and clay literally receives the brooch, and the returning tide times the apparition. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“wind’s teeth,” “foxfire”). The brooch itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only a touch of static lyricism in the fog tableau keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor memory without hoarding it—tightens when the mother demands the gnat’s release. Agency is shared yet decisive: the painter pries the resin, the keeper assents, both pay with loss. Pressure escalates through accumulating apparition and tide; coincidence (the mother’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is unmistakable in the keeper’s silent weeping and the vanished speck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete exchange: memory must be given back to stay alive. Subtext operates in gesture—the keeper’s hand over the painter’s, the gnat spinning away. The final image of rain trails “bright as breath” reweights the opening quest without moralizing. No thematic drift; every lyric pulse serves the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, insomniac, salt-raw: “paint became the only clean water I trusted.” Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long swells, sudden cuts. Compression is taught early (“I moved here to thresh meaning”) and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; even the keeper’s interiority is filtered through the painter’s perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “the island’s gulls threaded a cry through my ribs” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates into the seam scene, then exhales with the apparition. Every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The post-war tidal island, amber brooch, and rain-trail navigation synthesize into a fresh mythic economy. Familiar tropes—ghostly return, bartered heirlooms—are transformed through tactile specificity and ecological stakes. The gnat’s release as the price of memory is a non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
