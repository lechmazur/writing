<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—nostalgia vs. fear—drives every beat; the shell as vow and mirror as split-self are embodied choices that foreclose retreat. The final refusal to stay inside the painting costs the painter the fantasy of completion, felt in the warm shell and unsigned canvas.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer tightens the stake of keeping vs. surrendering the self-made copy. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the corridor seals, the pool reverts, the painter returns to the living harbor—cost paid in relinquished immersion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coastal cave breathes mineral syllables; the oasis pool becomes a temporal mirror that literally reconfigures space. The painted shell’s tiny harbor floating over fingers constrains the final choice: enter the corridor or keep the shell’s promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise or vanish into copies—escalates through each sensory intensification. The wrong-turn oasis forces the decisive micro-choice: add one brushstroke and leave, paying with permanent exile from the self-painted world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fidelity to one’s own unlived interior emerges from concrete acts: dipping the shell, drawing the submerged quay, walking away. Final image—harbor inhaling forever—offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature: “salt ghosts of places,” “slick alphabet on the stones.” Rhythm modulates from languid nostalgia to crystalline hush inside the cave; no head-hopping, no filter-verb fog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric density is purposeful; each metaphor earns its place (“tidal shards,” “mineral syllables”) and advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors; final cadence slows to match the painter’s backward step.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Familiar quest-into-cave becomes fresh through painter’s refusal to inhabit his own masterpiece. The wrong turn as right door, the single added brushstroke, and the unsigned canvas synthesize into an inevitable yet non-obvious closure.</comment>
