<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (idealism vs. cost) play out in the moment of planting the seeds. The boy’s shift from iron shoes to hush is credibly earned by the narrator’s micro-choice to trade her name and stories. One slip: the boy’s interiority is ventriloquised once (“fiercely gentle despite the grit”), nudging the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s act of planting the listening seeds crystallizes a new stance—tending rather than fixing—at visible cost (loss of grandmother’s stories). Causal chain holds: card → map → trade → planting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of ash and seeds reweights the stake without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile and atmospheric; lantern light on bone-hands constrains the final choice of planting site. Micro-setting (the pit’s upturned hand) directly charges the closure image. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are clear by line 6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending grief-torn souls—tightens when the narrator must give up the last of her grandmother’s stories to complete the trade. One clear escalation beat: the Weaver’s demand for a destiny that refuses the boy forces the narrator to risk her own narrative capital. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-repair emerges organically from the boy’s hush and the planted seeds; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “reminding the dark it was seen” reweights earlier motifs without statement. Subtext in the boy’s returned name and the orchard’s shiver carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through candle-soot taste and ash memory. Syntax modulates with pressure—“Night folded deeper”—without obscuring clarity. No POV leakage; even the boy’s speech is mediated by the narrator’s ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold. One near-mixed metaphor—“shoulders fell like a cliff relieved of scaffolding”—but the rhythm carries it. Final paragraph’s cadence shift earns the resonant close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantastical premise of destiny barter is grounded in sensory specificity and moral cost. Transformation test: story fails without the burned card and listening seeds. Fresh synthesis of tarot, catacombs, and orchard feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
