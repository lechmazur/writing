<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The truffle-forager’s rationality and involuntary honesty drive every beat—smuggling the eye, deflecting inspectors, guiding the group—so motivation is clear and embodied. Interiority is precise (“truth coil up my esophagus”), but the girl’s father anecdote is delivered second-hand, softening the relational crucible. The earned stasis—continuing to forage while the eye “grows warm”—carries visible cost and fits the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard steadies, the patrol withdraws, and the keeper now holds collective pain with a felt, ongoing price. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each truthful disclosure layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise. One minor slack: the inspectors’ refusal to cross feels slightly convenient, blunting the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, cliff ropes, and storm battering are vivid, selective, and directly constrain action—crossing the footbridge becomes impossible, forcing the patrol back. The glass eye’s micro-setting (knot-hole behind thyme) is tactile and stakes-relevant. Weather and terrain mirror internal fracture without overt symbolism, meeting the 9+ gate’s constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to speak unbearable truth without destroying the group—tightens when the patrol arrives; honesty must now shield the relic. Agency is exercised through careful sequencing of disclosure and concealment. The cost is the perpetual burden the eye absorbs, but the external threat dissolves rather than being transformed by protagonist choice, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety as shared vulnerability rather than secrecy. The glass eye’s final warmth reweights earlier “listening without wincing” into communal scar-tissue. Subtext in the inspectors’ refusal and the girl’s half-snagged laughter avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—fractured grace as sustainable honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively textured—measured, fungal, metallic—and stays rooted in the forager’s rational sensorium. Syntax modulates from lyrical (“ropes of rain that beat blossoms into paste”) to clipped tactical clarity when the patrol nears. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Compression like “keeper” for the eye is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or tactical detail. Occasional lyric overload (“chandelier strung between cliffs”) risks purple, but the rhythm always snaps back to the next necessary action. No loops or scaffold; grammar and spatial tracking are flawless. One minor mixed metaphor—“truth coil up my esophagus”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus world, antique ocular therapy, and aerial orchard cohere into a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of post-apocalyptic confession and relic healing are transformed through the truffle-forager’s grounded rationality and the eye’s glassy neutrality. The final image of the warming relic feels inevitable yet unforeseen, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
