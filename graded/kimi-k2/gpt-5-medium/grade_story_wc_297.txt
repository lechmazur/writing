<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“questions in my ribs”), but the root-bound visionary’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. tetheredness) are asserted more than dramatized in scene; the final vow is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the braided vow sealed in cambium reweights the covenant and forecloses restoration of the noon oath; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with the maze’s final grammar crystallizing the new stance. Cost is legible in the gardeners’ lowered shears and the sundial’s grudging concession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, grafted bark, and floating maze seed function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the dusk light and tide-telling sundial charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to restore or renegotiate the eclipsed covenant—tightens once when the protagonists refuse the gardeners and braid a new vow; the price is the irreversible loss of the old noon promise, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of promises as living, mutable architectures emerges organically from the garden’s sentient hedges and the braided vow; the final image of overlapping dreams offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature (“leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow”); patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the maze’s grammar, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure, and the final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of sentient topiary, scar-map sharing, and time-eclipsed oaths feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of a floating maze as grammar pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
