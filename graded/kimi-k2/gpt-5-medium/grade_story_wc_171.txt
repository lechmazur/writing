<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is specific—ink as weight, hands trained to “hold tension without bruising”—and the slow accretion of decisions under pressure feels embodied. Slight drift occurs where delegates become archetypal (“olive branches and lockpicks,” “red thread”), but each speech-act still lands as an individual micro-choice that tilts the stance toward consensus, so the high-band test is just met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Earned Stasis closure hinges on the joined-hands act with the bowl of casings: the forever war does not stop, but a path is foreclosed and a price acknowledged. Causal beats (mustering, drafting breathing, annual return) tighten under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the final image reconfigures stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terrace stones, fennel & thyme, and cracked beauty all constrain spatial placement and mood; the bowl of casings recurs as a charged micro-setting. While sensory palette is mild, the environment is tactile and choice-driving when wind and moonlight physically steady legs and anchor memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to price redemption—escalates through direct argument (“penalty without horizon is a prison”), micro-choices (redrafting clauses), and visible cost (general’s fatigue). Each turn is driven by protagonist agency and culminates in the ritual weighing of casings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from ritual as a working practice rather than slogan; the ledger is not moralized but enacted. Final lines about enemies’ sleep crystallize ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sustained lyric compression—“dissenters sharpening syllables into razors”—avoids exposition and teaches the reader the patterned elision early. No head-hopping; voice remains interior and resonant through crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and read-aloud musical. Only mild loop risk from three “ritual significance” repeats and a stray “heavy”/“gentle” echo; no artifact threatens closure legibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar peace-process tropes into quiet ceremony with literal weight of casings; synthesis feels organic in hindsight. No near-echoes of famous speeches and bold willingness to let silence remain awkward.</comment>
