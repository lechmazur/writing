<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“barometric tremors braided with rumor”), but the final sideways step feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is legible yet muted. The storm-recorder persona is consistent, but the watcher remains a cipher, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist refuses surrender and forecloses the gate path with the decoy charts and pigeon dispatch. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure thickens through layered images until the final reconfiguration. One minor ellipsis: the watcher’s arrival feels coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Courtyard stones, fountain clicks, and pigeon warmth are selective and POV-filtered; the bench and arch constrain movement and enable the lateral escape. Weather is both atmosphere and tactical data, charging the final image of rising pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs. surveillance—tightens when the note and watcher demand surrender. The sideways step is a visible trade-off: forfeiting immediate safety to preserve truthful data. Pressure escalates through barometric fall and spatial encroachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of integrity as internal barometer emerges through action, not statement; the final ledger entry reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—quarantine as care or coercion—yet the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and meteorologically precise; syntax mirrors the narrator’s observational cadence. Compression (“nurse in me bled no noise”) is taught early and paid off in stealth. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or tactic. Minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” risk in “storms tell truths where institutions edit them”—but it fits the archivist diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and surveillance; the storm-recorder as resistance archivist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Lateral escape and pigeon courier are inventive without gimmickry. One echo of familiar spy tropes, but transformed through sensory specificity.</comment>
