<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The caretaker persona is palpable in enacted micro-choices—cutting vines, watering pools, planting map scraps—yet the interior shift from caretaking others to tending her own self-forgiveness is more told than dramatized; final embrace of ongoing stewardship feels earned but lightly staged, capping emotional arc just shy of full integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hairpin’s final transmutation into vine-bound belonging crystallizes the stakes and forecloses both plunder and return, with visible cost in relinquishing ownership; maintains accumulative-textural lens—images intensify toward final charged hush without rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto and cloud-sea above pressure choices (shade paths, iron-grape air, stone stool, vine<|reserved_token_163765|> bed); these micro-settings actively enable pruning tactics and echo internal states; density of embodied detail ensures setting is indispensable yet slightly generalized, not irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate enduring contentment—narrows from capture to caretaking via escalating pruning choices against patience; internal/external stakes interweave, ending with earned stance and visible cost (loss of pin as perpetual pledge). Escalation proceeds under accumulative density shift rather than causal turns, sufficient for closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Contentment’s source emerges as garden stewardship rather than possession; final tending-turn reconfigures prior wander-and-seek into ongoing cultivation, resonant and non-explicit moral. The vineyard-hush motif reframes patience into lived practice, depth without preachiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinctly hushed lyric rhythm sustained; non-standard vine-and-silence metaphors taught early and sync with emotional cadence; POV remains strictly maternal first-person with perceptual bias toward gradual patience filtration; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is consistently musical yet precise—“vineyard hush” texture, tight image chains; occasional ornamental phrase (“scalop the rough edge”) almost decorative but modulates under pressure; minor loop paraphrase reminds self twice about contentment, deduct small −0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar quest-for-meaning trope with maternal forgiveness arc; specific images (unused ripening grapes, clam-through-fog grotto) provide fresh sensory charge that reframes mystical trope into grounded gardening. Avoids cliché without abrupt novelty.</comment>
