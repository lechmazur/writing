<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs reverence—play out in micro-choices (kneeling, tying, arranging). The final renunciation of speech in favor of fragile gesture earns the “esoteric realist” label with visible cost: the wing’s fragility mirrors the histories’ impermanence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch’s blessing crystallizes the stance that transient structures matter because they teach rooted impermanence. Cost is legible in the resin-weighted wing—beauty pinned against wind. Pattern taught early (reed triangles, pollen circles) and paid off in final semaphore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Verdant grotto is not backdrop; its water-taps and cooled gusts supply resources (knees rested, lip wetted) and constrain tactics (wind tears signals). Micro-setting of moss and resin bead charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: honoring undocumented keepers before erasure. Escalation is textural: each fragile structure increases the felt cost of impermanence. Monarch’s arrival tightens the cadence; hawk shadow interrupts, forcing altered grammar. Cost visible in resin anchoring the wing—beauty staked against loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: impermanence as ethical witness. Subtext in silence and pollen circles avoids moralizing. Final image—green light through moss—offers non-literal answer: history survives in attentive stillness, not stone. No thematic drift; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through the narrator’s skeptical reverence. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences breathe, fragments mark hawk shadow. No head-hop; tense stable. Distinct diction (“blushing stillness,” “useful obscurity”) remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each line advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm mirrors cadence theme—long/short fern stems echo heartbeat. Final paragraph’s green light sentence is flawless closure beat. Minor elevation in diction stays within esoteric realist lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—ritual archiving via biodegradable signals—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swap grotto for desert and story collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged poise. No close echoes; monarch as “last verb” is startling yet earned.</comment>
