<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—walking backwards under pressure, annotating silence with “combative tenderness”—but the child’s agency is mostly off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. Motivation (mentoring resilience quietly) is consistent and drives the final stance, yet the cost feels more communal than personal, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the council’s stay is stamped, the library remains, and the archivist corks the dusk with visible restraint. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned images (swing, shadow, tea leaves) tighten until the final tableau reweights exile as pivot rather than gate. One causal micro-turn (child reads the leaves aloud) crystallizes the stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library is tactile—dust instructs light, floorboards test retreat—and the afternoon-shadow bottle literally shapes the corridor that underlines the council’s choice. Micro-setting (kettle, chipped bowls) constrains hospitality under siege, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the playground swing’s geography drifts slightly, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—library’s survival—escalates through council decree; the archivist’s agency is to host, serve tea, and let the child read, a non-violent tightening that forces the council to re-measure. Cost is communal (risk of erasure) rather than personal, keeping it below the 8.8 gate, but pressure is coherent and stakes visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through concrete acts: corking dusk, uncorking corridor, annotating margins of silence. No moralizing; the final image of the swing “slows to listening” reweights loss as potential return. Subtext in tea-leaf angles and mirrored letters invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature—“dust instructs light to fold”—that remains consistent under pressure. Patterned elision (mirrored letters, reversible exile) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; syntax modulates with emotional intensity, culminating in the hush of the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and function. Occasional metaphor overload (“bruise remembering light”) flirts with overwriting yet serves the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the kettle’s steam and the swing’s metronome. Minor register drift in “ledger open to audit” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist and reversible exile feel freshly synthesized; the library as living hinge for communal memory is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes; the swing-shadow-tea triad is specific to this voice.</comment>
