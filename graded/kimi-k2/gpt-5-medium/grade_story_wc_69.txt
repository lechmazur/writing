<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her “stubborn practice” vs “effortless gift,” her shift from shouting slogans to listening—yet the students remain types (Rafi, Ola, Jin) rather than individuals under pressure. The final renunciation of perfection for “practice of hearing” is earned, but the cost is diffuse across the group rather than embodied in Mara alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the rosette’s passing crystallizes the shift from suspicion to shared stillness, a Charged Poise that reconfigures the room’s social space. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each subtracted noise layers trust—though the single tightening beat (rosette hand-off) is subtle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The velvet library is tactile—curtains “like patient throats,” shelves “breathing”—and the rosette functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Autumn’s hush mirrors the choir’s gradual unclenching, charging the ending image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braiding voices into harmony—tightens when Rafi and Ola’s eye-flash of “ruins” meets the rosette’s mediation. The cost is communal: suspicion lowered shoulders, children stopped fidgeting—felt but not individually priced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through subtraction: vanishing arts survive not by preservation but by circulation—rosette warmed by every hand. The final silence “like a bird that trusts an open palm” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled—velvet, dusk, “smoke in his tone”—with rhythmic variation that breathes with the choir’s dynamics. Compression (“traveled stillness”) is taught early and paid off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never clogged; each image (curtains as throats, rosette as coin) advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“varnished air”) stays within Mara’s musical lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar reconciliation arc is refreshed by the subtraction method and the rosette’s lineage—border-erased quartet—making the communal bridge feel inevitable yet specific. Risk lies in quietness, not spectacle, and it holds.</comment>
