<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“panic hummed,” “lips to air seam”); the contradictory drive—fear vs compulsion—propels every beat. The final renunciation of the gold fleck is earned by prior guilt and tactile ritual. Minor slip: the intern-era backstory is slightly front-loaded, though it later pays off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: leaving the fleck re-opens the circuit of remembrance, costing the protagonist her talisman. Causal chain—tide window → phase-transition lock → terminal reboot → name-reading—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate and spatial choreography precise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool interlock: the narrowing cave, the frost-sealed door, the brine-wet racks all constrain choices. The gold fleck itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement for the forgotten—tightens as each name scrolls. Agency manifests in the decision to return the fleck and speak the list; the cost is the loss of luck and exposure to claustrophobic risk. Escalation is one steady deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness to the erased emerges through concrete action (reading names aloud) rather than statement. Final image—gold left behind, tide breathing—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext of guilt and technological abandonment lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, salt-stained, and rhythmically controlled (“crashing hush,” “ice lacquered it delicate”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage. Compression and patterned elision (“I breathed once…”) are taught early and paid off at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise (“door unlipped with a tired sigh”). Occasional elevated diction (“communion”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of monastic gold, undersea espionage, and claustrophobic pilgrimage feels fresh and inevitable. The phase-transition lock and name-reading terminal are specific inventions that could not be swapped out. Risky compression succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
