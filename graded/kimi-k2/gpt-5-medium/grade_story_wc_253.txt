<comment>The performer’s interior contradiction—“blank-faced” certification against a felt grief—shows in micro-choices like shutting microphones off or letting petals fall. The climactic silence built with the child is earned by prior moments of staged compliance, and the cost is the unspoken but palpable forfeiture of public triumph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final broadcast delivers the line about “lightness, grief without the anchor,” crystallizing the stance that resistance = refusing measurable emotion. The drive (hybrid of situational pressure and accumulative resistance) is held and re-priced, with the felt cost in the shared breath that “finally did not.”</comment>

<comment>The turbines and farmhouse are more than backdrop; their shadows and noise press every scene, constraining how quiet can be made or noticed. The dried bouquet’s micro-move across beats (mantel → table → child’s touch) grounds the final hush in the smallest, most fragile object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—how to honor grief in a surveillance state—tightens when the inspector visit forces tactics, and again when the staged dish-without-audio becomes the decisive choice. Each act under the mandate is a trade-off where tokens and safety shrink while “lighter grief” is risked and achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges never stated: the difference between mandated happiness and the permissible lightness found in silence and brittle petals. The final image re-weights the premise—grief’s legitimacy without performative joy—leaving complex, earned emotional aftershocks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Diction is distinctive: “clock hands that forgot their point,” “ballast disguised as song,” each percept tilt keyed to the voice. Rhythmic compression (“We narrated with our hands only…”) teaches the non-verbal pattern, carried to the end without drift or filler.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid—“thin as a foal,” “pith bright as a wound”—each line performs multiple jobs. While one or two lines verge on poetic surplus (“paper breath”), clarity is never harmed, and the final image lands clean.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dystopian mandate + whispered resistance to emotional surveillance feels novel not for trope novelty but for the precision of its quiet weapon. The closing refusal to play sound—letting hush do the talking—transforms familiar materials into an inevitable, haunting act.</comment>
