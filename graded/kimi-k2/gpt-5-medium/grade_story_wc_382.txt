<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory wish to learn yet not interrogate is dramatized in the final rooftop choice. The neighbor’s dual identity is conveyed through gesture and subtext rather than exposition. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “agreed upon lies” that edges toward thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator accepts custodianship of the seal and the ethical mandate to “not be cruel with truth.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (creaks, wax, meteors) thickens until the building itself speaks. Cost is legible in the final image of ivy strangling and embracing at once.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stairwell drafts, kettle steam, rooftop rosemary, and meteor light are filtered through the narrator’s selective attention, each constraining the final act of pressing wax into stone. Spatial choreography is clean; the seal’s weight and the mortar’s sentence are tactile. One minor drift: “cathedral” feels slightly grandiose against the intimate rooftop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the building’s language without violating its mercy—tightens when the narrator must decide whether to press the seal. Agency is present; the choice forecloses the option of pure observation. Cost is felt in the inherited responsibility, though it could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of sheltering illusions. The final mortar sentence reweights every prior “lie” as reciprocal caretaking. No moralizing; the ambiguity between strangle and embrace lingers. The meteor shower reprises the opening “breaths” with new gravity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to architectural syntax. Compression (“sentences looking for a wall”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the narrator’s sensorium. Dialogue carries subtext without drifting into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long breaths to the clipped final rooftop cadence. One mixed metaphor—“small obedient star” for pocket wax—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of buildings as archivists of human weather feels fresh, grounded in sensory detail rather than gimmick. The transformation of “dead language tutor” from spooky trope to literal yet tender figure is earned. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
