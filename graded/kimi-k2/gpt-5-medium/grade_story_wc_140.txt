<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“my fingertips taste bitter”), motives remain consistent, and the final renunciation of confrontation carries visible cost. The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for memory yet refusing to reclaim his name—play out in the charged silence with the widow. Micro-choice of placing the label on the crate crystallizes stance and forecloses vengeance. Only minor drift: the “filters reality” trait is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the label placed on the crate reconfigures the widow’s options and the narrator’s identity without a spoken verdict. Causal chain—death certificate → ghost existence → fragment gathering → label confrontation—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One clean transition from dock to refrigerated stack keeps orientation tight. Cost is legible in the final image: the narrator remains nameless, the widow’s ledger now unbalanced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Port labyrinth is tactile and constrains movement; containers, catwalks, and oily water mirror the protagonist’s liminal state. The poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—salt rust, crane clanks, “low vowels” of the port. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stack to foreman office to widow’s warehouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming erased self versus accepting ghosthood—tightens when the label forces confrontation. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment layers pressure until the widow’s recognition crystallizes the cost. Agency lies in renunciation; the narrator chooses not to demand a name, foreclosing reunion. Coincidence (mechanic’s joke) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bureaucratic erasure versus lived memory emerges through concrete objects (label, certificate) and silences. Final image of the label on the crate reweights the premise: truth can be offered but not enforced. Subtext operates in the widow’s tremor and the clerk’s retreat. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who pays the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and salt-etched: “the ocean coughed me back onto the quay.” Compression and elision are taught early (“paperwork moves faster than tides”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to the nameless listener. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich—mechanic’s joke, widow’s whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture or stakes. Metaphors are precise and consistent—cargo as secrets, memories as rope. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest”) fits the narrator’s memory-obsessed lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise of surviving one’s own death certificate feels fresh, grounded in port logistics and insurance fraud. Tropes of ghost and widow are transformed through bureaucratic texture rather than gothic cliché. Specificity of container codes and import lines anchors the concept. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
