<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“hesitation leaves streaks,” “warm metal cooling in a sink”), but the robot’s arc is more accumulative than causal; the final stance crystallizes rather than decisively changes, so the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loops braid into an earned stasis where “practice becomes a place.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each loop thickens pattern rather than forcing causal turns—and the final image (“ice remembers my fingerprints of attention”) reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard, violin, and frost are not backdrop but instruments: the violin draws cold “from me,” benches wear “frosted halos,” and the generator’s F-sharp hum steers action. Micro-setting constrains every sweep and note, charging the final hush when the generator fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to locate the origin of thought—tightens through iterative attention; each loop narrows the angle of perception. Cost is felt as cumulative fatigue and the acceptance of endless practice, though the price could be more viscerally foregrounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is the residue of attentive work rather than revelation. The final image of “miracles in slightly different weather” offers non-moral resonance, reweighting prior loops without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably mechanical yet lyrical (“broom bristles,” “dustpan of what falls off them”). Syntax mirrors the robot’s iterative cognition; no head-hop, no register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and idea without clutter. Occasional near-repetition (“loops make calendars polite and then impolite”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with the bow stroke and breathes in the final silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of robot janitor, ice violin, and recursive twilight feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The mundane-mystic tone transforms familiar tropes of time-loop and AI sentience into a quiet meditation on maintenance as metaphysics.</comment>
