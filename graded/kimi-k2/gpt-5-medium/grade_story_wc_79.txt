<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent—"quietly driven" shows in every micro-choice; the copper tag and ledger anchor maternal absence with tactile specificity. The final step into the corridor crystallizes a credible, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: stepping into the watchers’ corridor reconfigures meaning and forecloses retreat, cost legible in the instant of being "measured." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (spirals, intervals, lattice) tightens until the final image reweights all prior material. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment (turtle shells, algae roofs, shell seams) constrains every move; the copper tag and ledger act as micro-setting that charges the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The city’s sway and the watchers’ glare are vivid, selective, and causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answering what the watchers see—tightens once when the corridor opens and footprints stop. Escalation is pattern-driven (five-six-five intervals, lattice grammar) that forces the protagonist’s decision to be measured. Cost is visible in the instant of stepping forward; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and mercy; the watchers’ silence reframes the city’s hunger as data. Final image—stepping into glare—offers a resonant, non-moral answer: to be seen is to be quantified. No explicit statement; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-locked; diction ("ridged spirals," "salt scars," "grammar of crossing") is specific to the cartographer’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Reed-whistle notes and tide-knot script teach the pattern early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned, never muddled. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Sentence variety supports urgency; final line lands clean. One hairline slip—“light keeps ringing like a bell” edges toward excess—prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—city on turtle shells, watchers as measuring devices—is fresh, specific, and fully committed. Pattern-language cartography and tide-knot grammar transform familiar quest motifs. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
