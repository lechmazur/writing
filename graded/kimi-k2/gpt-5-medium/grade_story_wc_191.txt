<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lore-keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“old ache of libraries”), but the final renunciation of the crown is slightly under-motivated; we see the wish to keep options open, yet the cost of refusal is only gestured at rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the throne stays empty, stewardship is shared, and the city’s rhythm shifts. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer of mural and orchard detail reweights the stake until the final image of “seeds we could finally plant” crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, tools, and objects (ruby flake, mural wall, wired pears) constrain every choice; the orchard’s metronomic apples literally pace the descent. The final image of dawn on the dome is charged by these same objects, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing a century of silence—is signaled early and tightened by the sunrise clock. The mural reveal and hatch opening are meaningful escalations driven by agency, though the cost of refusal could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship over sovereignty, memory over rule. The deferred-choice motif threads from “idle cursor” to “nobly empty chair,” culminating in a resonant, non-moralizing image of seeds rather than crowns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature (“broadcast waterfall,” “archived autumn”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image and function. Occasional stacked metaphors (“pears glowing with unsent messages”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the pattern; no loops or scaffolds dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of retro neon, algorithmic monarchy, and orchard dream-servers feels inevitable and fresh. Risky structural inversion—descent as ascent—pays off thematically without gimmickry.</comment>
