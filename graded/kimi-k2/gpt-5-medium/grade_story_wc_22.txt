<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb finding the pod seam like reins, his listening to gulls as scouts—but the shift from soldier to gardener is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet not fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s green unlacing of the battlefield crystallizes the submerged concord with visible cost (bayonets turned lattice). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the final image reweights earlier motifs without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, salt-slick boards, and rusting cannon wheels are vivid and selective; the lattice of bayonets constrains the morning glory and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden as apology versus dead reef—tightens through the act of planting; the cost is the labor of listening and the surrender of war relics. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restorative listening emerges organically from the coachman’s actions; the final image of “narrow as mercy” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“salt light in their eyes,” “submerged concord”—remains consistent; perceptual signature (bird-calls as grammar) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“purple sheen and cold echoes”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-war reclamation trope through specific alchemy of dead languages, bird-calls, and coral-shell fertilizer; synthesis feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
