<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and spiral-minded; the “helix” motif threads through micro-choices (tilting the mirror, calibrating breath). The final renunciation—leaving with pathways instead of trophies—earns its cost through prior embodied struggle. Minor slip: the colleague’s reappearance is more vision than pressure, blurring relationship-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pulse deepens pattern density until the canyon’s seam reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“a wider field of view” splits the mirror with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early via moonlit verge and periscope cue; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Canyon, mirror shards, and lichen constellations are selective, tactile, and constrain calibration choices. Final image of “cold air threaded like memory” recharges the setting as amplifier. Micro-setting (limestone shelf) functions as lab bench—no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is signaled early and tightened by each pulse: corridor child, older colleague, kite fragments. Cost is visible in the mirror’s final split and the speaker’s rearranged circuitry. Escalation is one deepening arc under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tending seams between futures and fossils emerges through concrete acts (etching copper traces, listening to arrangement). Final image offers non-literal answer: “every step a careful improvisation I could finally trust.” No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—helix logic, engineered metaphors, compressed lyric cadence. Perceptual signature (“I think in spirals”) stays consistent; no POV leakage. Patterned elision (e.g., “mineral and gentle”) is taught early and paid off in closure rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“fossilized whirlpool”) stays within POV’s lexicon. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—using a broken periscope as neuronal antenna in a dream canyon—is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
