<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fiddler’s interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., “luminous disbelief braids itself through my bow hair”—but the hitchhiker remains a cipher; his motives are relayed second-hand, blurring the relational crucible. The final choice to play the ledger-forgiving note is earned by the glass-flake discovery and the bow’s homing action, so the arc lands with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass clarifies, the hitchhiker re-appears, and the mountain ledger “signs a receipt” in the warmth of touch. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each counted detail and musical phrase tightens the weave until the final cadence reweights possibility. The only minor drag is a brief orientation wobble at the scaffold map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The pullout, scaffold wrap, and river under the bridge are rendered with tactile specificity; the scaffold’s arrows literally steer the fiddler’s descent, constraining the search. Micro-setting (glass flake, bow hair) doubles as charged objects, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether music can ransom a vanished life—tightens once: the shard’s image forces the fiddler to test the ledger. Cost is visible when the bow “writes policy” and the glass burns cold; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-transaction emerges through concrete particulars—collodion, ledger, bridge-song—without moralizing. The final image of “squares of pale approvals” reweights the premise conceptually, offering a non-literal answer to the cost of erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the fiddler’s perceptual signature: “river light pixelates through latticework.” Patterned elision (e.g., “words arriving as ripples”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within the POV’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“fabric city of warnings stitched to aluminum bones”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold artifacts; rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of wet-plate photography, pixelated amnesty, and bridge-song is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure; the ledger-as-camera-system feels newly minted yet emotionally true.</comment>
