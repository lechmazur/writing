<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“sand chilled my bones”), but the rival’s off-stage presence weakens relationship-as-crucible pressure; final annealing choice is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the frost-ledger fusion crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—cost is the public exposure of debt and the artist’s relinquishment of direct vengeance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Canyon, furnace ash, frost on stone—each micro-setting constrains tactics and recharges the final image; the cooled crown-glass slab literally becomes the “kiln of listening.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus survival—tightens when the ledger’s gaps become a map; the annealed window forecloses both destruction and easy justice, exacting social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “purpose in pauses” emerges organically from frost patterns and glass annealing; final image reweights silence as testimony without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is glass-specific, tactile, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature (“glass hears better than it sees”) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional metaphor overload (“black sun,” “tiny drought of soot”) grazes overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing a smuggler’s ledger into a dawn-readable glass window is a fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk-taking with lyric accumulation pays off in crystalline closure.</comment>
