<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thief’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, cautious abandon, catalog of thefts—yet the moral calculus (“take only what harm has taken first”) remains asserted rather than tested in scene. The final swap carries felt cost, but the earlier beats lean on lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each chess swap thickens pattern until the board exhales wrongness and mountains return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—sky rights itself, but the price is a silence in the lid and a promise to travel. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound spire, blue-lamp corridor, and chessboard of ice/ash are rendered with tactile specificity; the pocket sundial lid and carved pieces act as micro-settings that constrain every swap. Final image of mountains apologizing recharges the “wrong sky” motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the dissonant sky—tightens through each swap; the cost is the thief’s catalog of future restitution. One deepening turn: the queen’s letter reframes the entire quest as pre-ordained yet still requiring consent. Agency remains with the thief throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of restitution versus theft emerges organically from the chess swaps; no moralizing statements intrude. Final silence in the lid offers a non-literal answer: payment is the willingness to keep moving. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“cold that forgot how to bite,” “monks teaching sparrows to bow.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each figurative turn earns its keep. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during swaps, longer breaths during revelations. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-chess, debt ethics, and sky-tuning spire feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of carved pieces and constellations prevents template drift.</comment>
