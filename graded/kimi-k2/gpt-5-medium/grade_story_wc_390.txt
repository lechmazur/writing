<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ribs chimed faintly”), his contradictory impulses (logic vs. emotion) play out in real time, and the final renunciation—offering the key—carries visible cost. The seeker’s shift from hunger to unarmed listening is credible, though her backstory is compressed. No stock phrasing; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s chord reweights both characters’ desires, and the lighthouse beam reset is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—key unlocks stone, sound reframes seeker, shared guardianship emerges. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sonic matching taught early and paid off. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina and lighthouse are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains movement (ice nudging pilings, salt smell narrowing perception). The Fresnel lens room functions as micro-setting that shapes the final choice. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the Throat of Tides—is signaled early and tightened when the seeker arrives. Escalation is one deepening: Marek’s shift from solo guardian to co-keeper forecloses ransom option. Cost is the shared burden of listening; agency remains with Marek throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness-through-alignment emerges organically from the stone’s chord and the characters’ choices; no moralizing. Final image of “human hands asking weather to listen” reweights prior motifs without abstraction. Subtext in the seeker’s smile-ache is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“fleshly ethereal hush,” “honey into the cold”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tight to Marek; no head-hop. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“as if ordering soup”). Rhythm modulates with scene tension; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful (“stone crouched…like a patient lung”). Line-level craft supports the sonic motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse myth and acoustic pacifism; the “sonic absolution” concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lighthouse guardian, storm stone) are transformed through vibrational logic. Specificity of “drowned orchards and rebuilt towns” anchors universals.</comment>
