<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“shadow refused it”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lowering to stone reconfigures the loop and carries felt weight; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly from first rain-drop to final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The viaduct, puddles, and tablet function as micro-setting that constrains every step; specificity is selective and purposeful, though the city’s geography stays lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early; pressure tightens through the procedural path and culminates in the choice to surrender flight, with visible cost in the shadow’s return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between flight and groundedness; the final image of “darkening brightness” reweights prior motifs without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; patterned elision (“gravity defier earns faith the way others earn bruises”) is taught early and paid off at closure, with no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“caustic starlight,” “slippery mosaics”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>The synthesis of procedural generation, fractured timelines, and a gravity-defying loop feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
