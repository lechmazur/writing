<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory motives—obsessive precision vs ethical repair—are dramatized in bodily micro-choice: slowing the pendulum while naming each harm. Internal split between grief-tightened screws and patient re-shimming feels lived. Final act (offering the rake, joint launch) re-enacts absolution with earned cost; no safety hedging. Every tool in the tower embodies the self-debate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure: shared balance restored through the protagonist’s direct, reversible alteration at the crest of stillness. Narrative drive is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification rather than causal chain—with cost felt in the knell beneath water and the joint departure into tide. Orientation anchored in first 90 words; lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade> <comment>The ridge breathes, cuts, and answers back; tidal glass and brass gears share agency. Micro-setting—rake-handle grain and pendulum’s salt-scarred bruise—constrains each adjustment. Tower timbers heave like lungs inside the pause; final image (sea-spat mirror shards, knell under keel) recharges every prior detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade> <comment>Dominant stake: “restore shared balance through ethically attentive time.” Pressure coils tight in that pendulum pause—world holds breath—until repair is enacted. Single meaningful tightening: choice to carve neighbor’s child name on the rake and launch together. Cost: relinquish solitary righteousness; consequence legible in joined motion against tide bell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question> <comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: not “absolution” as word but as notch-keeping ritual. Each inscription shifts from scoreboard to covenant. Final image refuses tidy moral, offers ongoing shared wake across black water. Resonance held in tasting salt, iron, relief—not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade> <comment>Voice carries winder’s granular specificity: “brass scarred by salt,” “reed shim,” “moon gulls tilt.” Syntax slows to match the pendulum arc then quickens into solder’s spark. Patterned compression—“time returns like surf”—legible at closure without obscuring. No head-hop; internal texture remains precise, tactile, salt-tinged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade> <comment>Prose is vivid without density overdose; every figure earns its space (“black glass breathes with the moon,” “a plank of silence laid across the century”). Zero loops, no synonym churn, register consistent. Sentence lengths choreograph the tower climb and the breathless stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade> <comment>Fresh synthesis: the clock-keeper as penitent repairman using notched driftwood rake handle as confessional tally. No prior story has welded tidal obsidian ridge, brass pendulum, and reparative carpentry into one ethical gesture. Specificity grounds universals—time, repair, neighbor fracture—in salty particulars rather than symbols.</comment>
