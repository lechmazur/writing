<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The philosopher-mechanic’s interior contradictions bleed into embodied choices—using the needle card twice as decoy then as cartographer—so his final step into the gate costs him the safety of certainty; Rook’s surrender feels earned because it is shown as a stance crystallization rather than a concession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure satisfies Charged Poise: the atrium floor unfolds into the map-gate, forcing all three to choose simultaneous win-and-loss; the hidden overture turns from riddle to exit with palpable cost as Rook lowers steel and dignity alike.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The glass-and-brook micro-setting is no backdrop; light, reflection, and water are active co-plotters that reconfigure into the final spatial lock, directly constraining the moment of departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from abstract proof to lived irrevocable step; the “confession of ignorance” thesis is pressure-tested in steel and sunlight until the only unspent coin is departure itself; cost is registered on the floor and in Rook’s bow.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of philosophy-as-address arises from the act of fencing light into geometry, never editorialized; final image supplies non-triumphal resonance: “each step erasing the need for an answer” lands as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice weds lyric density to precise sensorium—“sequins,” “metronomes adopting jazz”—without a single unmotivated metaphor; the narrator’s perceptual signature remains unique and coherent under duel tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density and rhythm serve propulsion: syntax accelerates during the bout, breathes during the reveal, then contracts to the exit beat; a single mixed metaphor (“anvil courtesy”) is offset by the larger musical coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transmutes stale duel trope into epistemological encounter; every prop—needle, sundial, foil—earns conceptual weight; synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
