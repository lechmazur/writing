<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “need to be seen” and eventual renunciation are credibly rooted. The researcher’s reverse-aging remains a label rather than a felt constraint, limiting full contradiction. Micro-choice to release the village dam is dramatized with visible cost, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s vanishing reweights prior material and carries felt social cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of rings, candles, and backward steps tightens to final image. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto and floating platform are vivid, selective, and constrain choices (stone rising, platform dipping). Sensory hierarchy filters through POV urgency. Final image of the grotto “pulling time” charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn how to be seen by learning to vanish”—is signaled early and escalates through trance vision. One meaningful tightening: agreeing to release the village dam narrows options with visible social cost. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing as gift of space emerges organically from concrete events; no moralizing. Final image reweights premise without statement. Subtext in silence between teacher and student crystallizes the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; sycamore hush, lake smoke, copper candles create perceptual signature. POV stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with trance deepening. One minor register drift—“scholar’s weather”—does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of reverse-aging mentor on magnetically levitating island feels fresh and fully committed. Transformation test passed: story could not swap names or places without collapse. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes and lands cleanly.</comment>
