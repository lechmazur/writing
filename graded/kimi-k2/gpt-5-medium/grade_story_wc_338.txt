<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The framer’s “methodically curious” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching the tear, comparing reels, tracing the seam—each with visible cost (the map’s wound, the village’s risk). Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The final act of framing the torn map crystallizes a renunciation: the known is forever joined to the unknown, cost paid in the visible scar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the torn map hung by the door reconfigures the parish’s stance toward its own blanks. Causal chain holds—tear → video comparison → seam → reopening → reframing—with each step narrowing options and raising communal stakes. Cost is legible in the hush that now belongs to the room and in the wound left visible in the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and whispered chapel are not backdrop but active constraint: the slit architecture that literally folds breath into hush shapes the final choice to keep the door ajar. Sensory detail is selective—cold air nicking fingertips, dust like sleep—and filtered through the framer’s professional eye. The henge’s slow vigil reappears to echo the vault’s bellows-breath, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor silence without erasing it—tightens once: reopening the chapel risks destroying the very hush the village values. Escalation is driven by the framer’s agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each archival comparison adds density until the seam’s breath becomes undeniable. Cost is felt in the parish’s collective hush and the map’s irreparable tear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as architecture, history as seam, empathy as the willingness to leave wounds visible. No moralizing—just the final image of the torn map marking where known meets unknown. The whispered chapel reweights earlier footage and frescoes into a living constellation of dotted prayers, inviting reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled lyric texture—“shielded openness” enacted in syntax that withholds yet welcomes. Perceptual signature is precise: “rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the framer’s methodical gaze. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple drift. Minor scaffold appears in “we walked… we descended… we found,” but the rhythm serves the accumulative design and never obscures causality or dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archival footage, limestone erosion, and architectural hush feels inevitable yet fresh. The whispered chapel is not a gothic gimmick but a literal acoustic device that reweights silence from mystery to stewardship. Risk in structure—quiet lyric accumulation—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
