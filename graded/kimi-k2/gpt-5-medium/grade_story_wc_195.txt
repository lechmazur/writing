<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight’s interiority is embodied and specific—his soft steps, the cold palm on his face, the murmured allegiance all reveal a layered shift from war to tending. The mother-memory is anchored in the program, not abstract, and the final choice to taste the kernel carries visible cost (foreclosing other futures). Minor: the “bones echoed” line edges toward stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat thickens the orchard’s pattern until the geometry of fruit-constellations crystallizes into the kernel choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—possibility settles like a homecoming—earned by every prior sensory graft. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but agent: glass panes cloud into possible mornings, branches braid into proscenium, fossilized pollen slab receives the program. Micro-setting (the ladder “written by bees”) directly enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—cold night palm, nectar hiss—never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is tested when he must choose one future and release the rest. Escalation is accretive: each grafted star narrows infinity to the single pulsing kernel. Cost is legible in the swallowed futures and the theater bells’ toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of renunciation versus cultivation emerges through concrete orchard labor and the mother’s puppetry legacy; no moralizing. Final image of “mornings that require tending” reweights the war-torn past without stating a thesis. Subtext in the program’s stage directions versus lived pathos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: syntactic elongation mirrors breath under glass, compression tightens at the kernel choice. Distinct perceptual signature—“reality shifts and the rows rearranged themselves to his measured breath.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked in the knight’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every image advances pattern or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“lantern fruit,” “stitched constellations”—and culminate in the “clenched hand” kernel. Rhythm modulates with ascent and hush; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard grafted to puppet-theater cartography is a fresh synthesis; the mother’s program repurposed as star-map feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the geometry resolves into choice. No derivative echoes.</comment>
