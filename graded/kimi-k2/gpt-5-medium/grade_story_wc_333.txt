<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the mother-memory knot tightens through tactile recall. The final renunciation—singing the loss into a beginning—carries visible cost in the ribbon’s unbinding. Minor slip: the locksmith’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, but the POV’s arc is intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard mirrors re-align, the ribbon lifts, and the idea of return is freed under starlight. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each image accrues until the final cadence shift reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of the keepsake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The broken-mirror courtyard constrains movement and supplies the final image; shards tilt to form a path that literally reconfigures the protagonist’s stance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor drift: “cosmic possibility” edges toward abstraction, but the micro-setting remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing the idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and tightened through the escalating ritual. The final song forecloses the option of continued silence; the price is the surrender of the mother-locket. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: a lock is made of belief, and belief can be sung open. The final image reweights the mother’s promise from wound to invitation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the locksmith’s silences and the mirrors’ shifting reflections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; syntax modulates with emotional intensity (“a warmth that strained toward a door that did not exist”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. One minor loop—“the sky loosened its blue” followed by “the sky hummed in answer”—but momentum is unbroken. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-as-guide trope is transformed through ritual specificity and the inversion that no physical lock exists. The fresh angle: grief itself is the lock, and song is the pick. Risk-taking in structure and metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
