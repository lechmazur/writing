<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is luminous and embodied (“eyes bright with inward constellations”), but the summoner’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy’s code unravels under breath-guided attention, the future exhales, and the summoner leaves with a “vow that hums.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern intensifies, silence deepens, cost is the relinquishment of certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The brook, wing, and fox form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; water’s “delicate arithmetic” and the wing’s drift directly enable the unwriting of prophecy. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“hush a prophecy”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the code clings to stone and the summoner must guide breath through stillness. One decisive intensification: the seam in time is found and loosened, foreclosing iron noon with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of listening until “sound remembered mercy.” The final image of the wing carrying a “bead of water like a planet” reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the summoner’s inward constellations. Patterned elision (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality. Occasional stacked metaphors (“lantern of calm opened and burned without smoke”) risk overwriting but remain legible and serve the cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of origami cartography, silence-mapping, and prophecy-unwriting feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; the quiet blaze of listening becomes a singular artistic stance.</comment>
