<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands furiously tranquil”), but the final renunciation—passing the pattern on—leans more on inherited lore than on a fresh contradiction exposed under pressure; cost is felt yet slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cap planted in loam reweights the orchard’s future and the keeper’s stance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the vortex’s softening and thawing serve as cadence shift with visible cost (loss of sole custody).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound atrium, starlight, frost-veined glass, and the oak cap all constrain choices and charge the final image; micro-setting (the cap as hearth) functions as pivot. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of seasons via vortex—tightens once when the keeper must release Return into the cap. Cost is legible: relinquishing exclusive guardianship. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship versus ownership emerges organically through seed imagery and the act of planting the cap. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric compression is consistent and taught early; perceptual signature (“breath hangs like frost-laced bells”) remains distinct under pressure. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene temperature. Occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of inheriting seasons via vortex-egg feels fresh; synthesis of seed lore, entropy reversal, and urban ruin is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric ellipsis) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
