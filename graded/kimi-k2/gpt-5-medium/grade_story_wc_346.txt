<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“bruised awe lived under my ribs”), but the adjuster’s final choice to sing rather than mechanically repair is more asserted than dramatized; the puppet’s counsel is charming yet external, softening the sense of internal contradiction driving the act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical layer thickens until the final song reweights the world’s stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the beam’s vow—whose cost is the adjuster’s exhaustion and the lantern’s dimming, both legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse, pane of hush, and puppet head are tactile constraints that shape every adjustment; the “salt-crusted” hand on the machine in the last line fuses body, tool, and setting into the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—delaying global doom—tightens when the bent brass tooth threatens collapse; the adjuster’s agency is to file and then to sing, each act narrowing options with visible strain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy-through-delay emerges from the adjuster’s embodied labor and the lullaby’s reach; the final image of the world pressing its cheek to the glass offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, salt-stained, and rhythmically controlled; patterned elision (“gears nested within gears”) is taught early and paid off in the nested song that swallows thunder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“cathedral of time,” “driftwood saints”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The doomsday-clock lighthouse reframed as a metronome teaching waves secrecy is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
