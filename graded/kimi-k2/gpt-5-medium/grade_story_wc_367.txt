<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interior contradictions crystallize in concrete micro-choices (steering silence into beam-shape, sleeping on emerald glass). The arrival of the prophetic child re-weights the motive toward stewardship; the final renunciation—“we keep laughing”—lands with visible cost in lost sleep, inked ghosts on a child’s tongue, and the tower’s solitary crown. Interiority is particular, never diagnostic, but the lens of hybrid design keeps motive just on the safe side of abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Tight causal chain under hybrid lens: print industry death → tower stewardship → storm partnership → child arrival → published beams as new journalism. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: laughter as “ballast” crystallizes the choice to endure rather than escape, cost palpable in sleepless stair-post and orphaned child fed soup. Spatial anchors are taught early; disorientation serves closure rather than vice versa.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Total internal reflection is not ornament—it constrains how the beam bends, hence how ships steer; the tower’s own “bones” (recycled emerald bottles) become literal load-bearing history. The setting’s emerald coolness presses against the narrator’s cheek every night, locking them into place. Weather and optics integrate causally rather than serve backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: the survival of authentic signal in a post-print world. A meaningful tightening occurs once: arrival of child turns the wager into guardianship of future readers. Cost is visible in ink-stained tongue, sleep forfeiture, and the tower’s stubborn isolation. Agency is endurance, not miracle, and still forecloses other futures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of obsolete media and living oceanic memory. “Tomorrow is only a room we lens from the present” is earned because storm and tower physically do the lensing. Closure offers conceptual repricing without moral: the new newsroom broadcasts light, not paper, and the cost of that shift lingers on the child’s tongue. Ambiguity remains fertile rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tidal—breathing between lyrical compression and grounded tactile detail (“glass bones…green coolness”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is precise, never ventriloquized. Syntax mirrors the optic spiral of total internal reflection. Compression is controlled so every surplus syllable feels deliberate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies fluidly; no loops or scaffold. Images are dense but never muddled (“braid of fused silica fibers that drinks light like rain” is concrete, not purple). Technical references are accurate and motivated. One minor echo—“laughs” repetition—slips back in without derailment; the final crystallized image rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Breathes fresh life into the lighthouse keeper trope by marrying post-apocalyptic media death to optics that literally transmit memory. The storm as co-editor, ink on a child’s tongue as archive—the synthesis is non-obvious and specific. Could not swap elements without structural collapse.</comment>
