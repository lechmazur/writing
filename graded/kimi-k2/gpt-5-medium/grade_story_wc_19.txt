<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth”), but the father’s shift from bunker-builder to collaborator feels compressed; the porcelain doll’s listening role is charming yet under-exploited in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared taste of gilded hush re-weights “safe” from blast-door to home, with the cost of widening bunker entrances. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the hour-long inversion and trellis pattern are taught early and pay off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The xenial trellis, gravity inversion, and porcelain doll all constrain choices and charge the final image; spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The trellis’s widening landing directly enables the graceful descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting a silence the father can understand—tightens when the gilded hush is rationed and shared. The cost is visible: widening bunker entrances sacrifices the father’s original fortress logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between bunker silence and trellis silence; the final image of “a mapped hush” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“taste how quiet changes shape”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No POV drift or register mismatch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but patterned and purposeful. One minor loop—“stretching contracted like a lung exercising itself”—is borderline paraphrase but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion-trellis-silence tasting conceit is fresh and fully committed to; the synthesis of bunker safety vs. breathable hush feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
