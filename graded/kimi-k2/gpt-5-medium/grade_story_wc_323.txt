<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the instructor’s contradictory pull between safety and wonder is dramatized through the night crawls and the anchor link. The final bow with open palms crystallizes a stance with visible cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the alien exchange reweights the premise, and the instructor’s new knowledge carries an undeniable conceptual cost—he must now teach a method that may drown wonder. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final blossom of planes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The benthic city is rendered through selective sensory pressure—salt-pitted anchor, kelp shadows, lamp-erased edges—that constrains navigation choices. The anchor link and dome shadow function as micro-settings that charge the final image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to steer without stars—tightens when the instructor risks night crawls to map erased edges. The alien return forces a crystallizing exchange that forecloses naive reliance on city lamps; cost is the burden of new, possibly fatal knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between manufactured light and remembered star-pressure; the final image of “listen to the edges” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—measured, salt-tinged, lyrical yet precise. Perceptual signature filters every detail through a navigator’s priorities. Patterned elision (“slow glass,” “tide stamp”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths in instruction, clipped pulses during the alien exchange.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of underwater astronomy, alien edge geometry, and somber marvel feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise could not survive relocation to another setting.</comment>
