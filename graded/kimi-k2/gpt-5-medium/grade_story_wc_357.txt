<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pilot’s contradictory awe and duty tighten under pressure. The arrow tip and resin spindle crystallize her inherited flaw—seeking inherited answers—into a visible cost: she must keep listening each inversion. Micro-choices (cinching harness, touching metal to resin) reveal hierarchy of values. Only the grandmother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (floating arch, sap, resin) thickens pattern until the spindle reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—planting the fused heart beneath the mended drum—whose cost is the perpetual duty of return. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks. Final image braids memory, water, and echo with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, sap-gleam, and resin spindle are not backdrop but tactical terrain: water roads, root lattices, and the spindle’s bowl steer every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—pilot reads rivulets, tastes promised rain. Micro-setting (arrow tip fused to spindle) constrains the final choice. No spatial drift; world rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the source of resilience—tightens when the spindle’s revelation demands perpetual stewardship. One meaningful deepening: discovery redefines resilience from trophy to ongoing practice. Cost is the open-ended obligation to tend echoes each inversion. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture: resilience as music that gathers, bends, carries home. No moralizing; final image of soil drinking “rain remembered” reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the arrow’s hum and the spindle’s breath carries generational memory. Complexity lingers—resilience is maintenance, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through orchard-pilot training (“read the rivulets”). Syntax modulates with emotional lift—long breaths in calm, clipped fragments under inversion pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Compression (“whirling silence folds sound into velvet”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm mirrors gravity’s shift—fluid ascent, controlled descent. Occasional elevated diction (“grammar of drips”) remains within lyric register and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of gravity inversion and floating orchards is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. Arrow tip as memory-needle and resin spindle as seed-heart synthesize myth and agronomy. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; specificity makes the concept inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
