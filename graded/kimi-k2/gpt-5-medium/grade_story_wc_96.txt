<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Penny Poet shows contradictory impulses in scene—renouncing identity while clinging to rhyme—and the monthly molting becomes a deliberate, embodied choice with social cost (“ghost of copper on the fingers”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens intact: lyrical density and cadence shifts (“draw the lines between them”, “blue lid lifts”) reweight the stake—how beauty is practiced under threat—while the ending crystallizes an earned stasis with visible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rusted library functions as tool, body, and social constraint—access to boards, proximity of passer-by, fence as harp missing strings—charging the final image of dawn lifting a blue lid with iron-scented consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Blooming resistance escalates under situational pressure: each new hand from bus stops narrows the plan into an inevitable act of endurance before demolition notice looms, trading safety for collective creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Subtext emerges through accumulation: pennies inked with phrases reprinted before demolition fuse stolen beauty and personal loss, making the final poem‐kite a resonant, non-moralizing answer to “why risk it?”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Single lyric POV holds perceptual signature—rain-and-iron skin, copper syllables burning holes—while purposeful elision (Neruda passed “like a lit match”) is taught early and paid off when the map of sparks ignites.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm accelerates from molasses hush to “harp missing strings” under tightening stakes; no bloated lyric blocks obfuscate the final charged poise; each sentence advances the communal rebuilding beat or mythic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion of queer outlaw mutual aid and myth-poet voice feels inevitable in hindsight; transformation from dog-eared prison books to sky-kites belies risk, but late reveal of city demolition notice keeps stakes coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Decisions to molt, spill copper phrases, and renounce next-self anchor every beat; each penny-poem spent becomes an irrevocable tactic under demolish-week deadline.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Coffee tin appears as map-and-key twice—first clink in secret beat, final false-bottom rattle—supplying both hinge beat and closing click sound, forging continuity.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The blooming resistance concept reshapes everything: stolen poems as seeds, strangers as vines, and the act of nightly rebuilt shelves becomes the embodied tactic against demolition.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Molting trait manifests when next personality clowns and brightens, forcing midnight hand-off of all command decisions and culminating in the ghost of copper left on strangers’ fingers—visible cost.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rebuild beats trace from milk-crate reading to door of refrigerator panel; without nightly hammering and riveting the closure image of a blue lid would never lift.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prison library origin anchors their sorting-of-hope mechanics—gut-trust, slanted delivery of Neruda—all repeats in the way strangers now alphabetize futures on flattened pennies.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rusted library fences pressure access and resource scavenging; rusty shelving boards as ribs become literal vertebrae supporting the nighttime breath of their small society.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Moon clearing skyline tightens decision window—each copper poem must land before dawn or demolition notice triggers—clock visible on page dictates urgency.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Beauty-from-anarchy desire collides with literal bombshell citation; renunciation at the end costs them anonymity yet saves the communal shelf.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Luminous fracture tone arcs from iron-dark night to blue dawn grin, modulating every time rust and hope sharpen into a final glint of copper tear at skyline.</comment>
