<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the translator’s contradictory impulse—wanting to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice. The coral fragment and cast function as extensions of motive, not props. The final renunciation (offering the coral to the bedside) is earned and carries visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coral placed at bedside crystallizes a reconfigured truce without spoken treaty. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each smudged signature, coral turn, and rain tick tightens the emotional weave. Cost is legible in the uncle’s nod and the mother’s salt-soft word.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, coral fragment, and rain function as micro-settings that constrain gesture and pacing. The coral’s grooves literally steady the pauses in speech; the fog lowers like a treaty only touch can read. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can shared grief be translated into coexistence—tightens through each decoded smear on the cast. One meaningful deepening: the moment the mother mouths the Reka word for shelter. Cost is felt in the uncle’s sleeve-grab and the room’s unclenching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the child’s boats labeled “Us / Also Us” and the coral’s shift from relic to key. No moralizing; the final image of fog as unreadable treaty reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in silence and coral placement is precise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the translator’s perceptual signature—“unknot weather in other people’s chests.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor register drift in “pelagic syllables” is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—conflict-zone translator decoding a child’s cast as peace conduit—is fresh and specific. Coral fragment and cartoon storm cloud transform familiar symbols through tactile use. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
