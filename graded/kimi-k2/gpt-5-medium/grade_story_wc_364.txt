<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iven remains distinct and internally consistent; his meekness threads through every action (“rarely raised his voice”) yet converts into fierce refusal to yield. Embodied trade-offs—memories bartered for steadiness—show contradictory impulse in real time. The final image refracts that resolve into earned stasis. Minor drift: “quietly determined” flirts with label speak once, but the embodied bruised-wrist cost compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: rhythmic accumulation of detail tightens until the arches lower and rubble sighs into usable shape. Closure charges (Resonant Reconfiguration) inside the final paragraph: “orchard by orchard, awake and deliberate” crystallizes cost—awakenings bought not with coins but memory and bruise. One unobtrusive ellipsis sustains voice without breaking causality. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches and cracked terraces remain tactile constraints that must be negotiated or worked around; the silk threads through rubble tunnels, the arches lower physically, affecting tactics. Sensory selectivity never strays into catalog. Micro-setting is mined shafts functioning as arteries. Only a hairline drift into “azure” motif without concrete pressure keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (“coax resilience from rubble”) is announced in the opening paragraph and every beat adds weight: memory vs. steadiness, sleep vs. wakefulness. One decisive deepening—tying honest oaths to silk tightening—narrows the trade-off into irreparable loss. Cost is felt at wrist and in stolen childhood names. No coincidence resolves; everything is bartered.</question>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges not from assertions but from iterated act-exchange until “rubble learned to stand without leaning on him.” Subtext of bartered love is carried in image rather than slogan. Final bell ring in the key of azure defiance reconfigures the orchard planet’s tone without verbalizing the payoff. Earned, understated wisdom.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct voice coils around meekness turned into steady hammer-strokes: lexical texture, controlled line-break cadence, and refusal of dramatic declaration. Compression taught early (“hammering more hope than iron”) pays off in final echo. Notable compression and purposeful elision keep momentum taut; no head-hopping or unmotivated psychic drift. Only a single near-repeat of “deliberate” across adjacent lines prevents perfect 10.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; every line multi-tasks atmosphere, causality, and theme. Metaphors are precise—arches “like patient whales,” silk “a vein of day” without clutter. Paragragraph cut test justifies all units, minor scaffold loops absent. Final third is clean; no clarity loss at closure. One overly stacked alliteration (“silence than stories, Iven listened to stones like a doctor to a pulse”) nudges toward 9 rather than 10.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh twist on mythic rebuild: bartering literal memories for geological steadiness re-weights the hero-journey without retreading. No borrowed set-piece of dragon or flood; the magician’s silk is used as material engineering device, not fantasy crutch. Core metaphor—deliberate acts as currency—could only occur here; transplant-proof. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk taken and paid.</question>
