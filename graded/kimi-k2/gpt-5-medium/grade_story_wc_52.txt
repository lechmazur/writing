<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—her thumb pressing the scuffed notch, the refusal to restore the name—yet the final renunciation (leaving the collar unfinished, the tin unopened) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The widow’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. to release) act simultaneously in scene, not summary. No stock phrasing; every gesture is tethered to the ring of grief. Flaws (her silence, her compulsion to ritual) complicate the carving and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wrapped bundle on the sill crystallizes options—she has shaped absence into a companion without naming it. Cost is legible in the final image: the collar is “all breath and collarbone,” a presence that will never warm. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Pattern taught early (kettle as metronome) and paid off in the quiet pour.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loft, kettle, and rain-beaded skylight constrain every move: steam ropes the air, droplets become lenses that freeze the city, the kettle’s whistle tests itself like a child. Micro-setting (the ash blank, the tin) functions as geography. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices what resists the blade, not tourist details. Weather and tools evolve with action; no static repetition. Final image recharges the skylight and ropes, now emptied of beasts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: how to live with absence without erasing it. Pressure tightens once: the knot in the wood forces a choice—sand it away or let it remain as scar. Agency is renunciation; she refuses completion and restoration, foreclosing the path of perfect memory. Cost is the unfinished collar that will never fit his throat. Escalation is textural—each shaving curls like whiskers, deepening the ache until the final quietus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of presence and absence: absence deserves a faithful likeness. Subtext lives in gesture—her thumb on the scuffed notch, the unopened tin. No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without statement. Thematic resonance is carried by the collar’s hollow curve and the rain’s beaded lenses, not by commentary. Complexity is honored: she neither clings nor lets go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and grief-soaked: “wood is a patient animal,” “steam ropes the air.” Syntax mirrors her slowed ritual—long sentences breathe, short ones cut. No head-hopping; POV is locked and modest. Diction stays within her lexicon (gouge, collarbone, matinee). Rhythm accelerates only with the kettle’s whistle, then settles into the final hush. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every line advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors are precise and consistent—no mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each shaving, droplet, and breath is new information. Register never drifts. Final paragraph achieves crystalline quiet without slack. Minor hairline slip: “the kettle hum thickens” edges toward personification cliché, but the context redeems it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar widow-grief trope through circus specificity and woodworking ritual. The collar-as-absence is a fresh angle; the rain-beaded skylight as time-lens is non-obvious. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the ending reconfigures meaning without causal reversal. No echo of famous lines. Synthesis feels inevitable: the circus yard, the kettle, the ash blank cohere into a singular vision.</comment>
