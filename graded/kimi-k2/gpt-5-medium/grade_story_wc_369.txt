<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; the grief-work through dream-dust and ledger angles is character-specific. Motivation to “discover what trees witness” drives every micro-choice, culminating in the root-room excavation. The final renunciation—labeling the jar “minutes yet unread”—earns its cost from prior causality. One slip: the phrase “measured grief will float if you let it” drifts toward therapeutic abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sweep of dream-dust, each tag lifted, thickens pattern until the sextant’s crack seals and the tower stops leaking. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in the quiet register of trees—charged by the protagonist’s refusal to finish reading. Cost is legible in the dawn image: “every tree gleamed as if just rained.” No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, moonlit brass, and root-breached wall are vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV’s maintenance gaze. The sextant and root function as micro-settings that constrain the final alignment and crack-sealing. Weather and architecture guide every move—lightning flash cues the needle jerk; dripping chains mark descent. One hairline slip: “milk blue breath” edges toward purple, but the image is brief and serves the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grief transformed into readable minutes—is signaled early and tightened by each tag’s weight and ache. Agency is exercised in excavation, arrangement, and final labeling; the cost is the unread remainder. No external antagonist needed; the labyrinth’s archive supplies coherent pressure. One minor slack: the storm’s threat never escalates beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witness and measured sorrow emerges organically from dust, tags, and root-minutes. Subtext operates in the sextant’s silent warming and the spoon’s retirement. Final image of tree-quiet offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif returns reweighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and compressed—“the maze below me sighed like a sleeping boiler.” Syntax mirrors the POV’s meticulous craft: short clauses for maintenance, longer lyric stretches for wonder. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. The diction stays within the lexicon of a solitary worker who speaks to hinges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function—“I logged each tag…with small drawings of angles.” Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Minor loop: “some things feel like they are waiting…” repeats the prior “waiting for repair,” but the echo is brief and thematic. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—labyrinth archiving arboreal witness via numbered metal tags—is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The fusion of maintenance craft, dream quantification, and botanical memory feels non-obvious yet coherent. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final tree-gleam. No derivative echoes.</comment>
