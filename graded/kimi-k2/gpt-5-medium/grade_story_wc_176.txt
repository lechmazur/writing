<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The caster’s interior contradiction—“technically gentle” vs. survivor’s guilt—fuels every micro-choice: testing rope without breaking memory, releasing his own name, then staying to listen. “I lay on the floor… bells said stay, cast, listen” crystallizes the Earned Stasis cost with embodied exhaustion and open ribs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tightly causal Accumulative/T extural arc: each braid turn narrows options and raises cost until the final image reweights the premise—perforated ghosts fixed into bronze syllables. Closure lands on cost: “I slept… heat cooled and names still sounding” shows options foreclosed and cost paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum, furnace breath-mist, mirrored mica, rope fibers—all particulars directly constrain tactics (rope guides shutters, aurora dictates pour angles) and charge the closing image: rope tugging bronze ears awake under fading green light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—escalates through each braid turn and organ breath; every shift narrows the field of action and layers cost, culminating in renunciation/sustained attention rather than ringing resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-ongoing-craft rises from concrete action (mislabeled wedding bell year-long retrieval) rather than speech, landing in resonant ambiguity: the bells speak slowly, refusing tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elegantly compressed, lyrical first-person voice—“heat like a conscience,” “snow stitched its patient seam”—holds steady POV throughout while allowing syntax to expand and contract with emotional pressure. Micro-elisions and purposeful fragmentation mirror the foundry process on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet precise; occasional stacked metaphors (“oldest… stars”) flirt with overwriting but the rhythm always serves urgency. No loops or redundant scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice under heat and ice.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar grief ritual into foundry cosmology; the aurora as forge and bells as syllable-keepers feels inevitable yet non-derivative. Specific occupational detail anchors the lyric conceit without showiness.</comment>
