<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., “I bled a dawn of diluted oranges into the frames”—but the dream remains more symbol than agent, so the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than personally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dream is let go while the map “hummed,” reconfiguring the librarian’s stance from pursuit to stewardship; the cost is the luminous absence itself, made legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archipelago breathes and whispers coordinates, constraining every move; the watercolor palette and camera function as micro-settings that literally shape the final map, anchoring the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escorting rather than capturing the dream—tightens once when the sea demands a price; the librarian’s refusal to turn around crystallizes the stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Longing as cipher emerges through salt footprints, glass plates, and the final “passage not possession”; the theme deepens without moralizing, resonating in the charged last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and textured—“palette stained by mornings that never arrived”—with controlled psychic distance; no POV drift or register slippage under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional metaphor surplus (“laughing in a dialect only the surf could translate”) never stalls momentum or clouds the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The librarian-as-photographer-of-dawn conceit feels inevitable; the synthesis of archive, tide, and dream yields a fresh angle on pursuit and release, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
