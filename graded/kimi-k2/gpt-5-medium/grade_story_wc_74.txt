<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s insomnia and methodical hopefulness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (paint-stained fingers, dipping the brush). The final dot of gold is earned by her sustained, quiet labor and the neighbor’s return, crystallizing her arc without tidy resolution. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes. Cost is felt in sleeplessness and the perpetual anonymity of her gifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the neighbor’s arrival and shared silence reconfigure the meaning of every prior portrait. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each kindness portrait is an offering that accrues until the city answers. Orientation is immediate; stakes tighten when the neighbor places the map. Cost is visible in Lina’s exhaustion and the unspoken weight of continuation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is not backdrop; its peppery tomato vines and moonlit glass constrain Lina’s ritual and amplify the hush. The brush, a micro-setting object, literally drinks moonlight and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—door, box, canvas, stove—tracking every motion. Smog and moonlight interact with the stakes, not merely garnish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving kindness persists—tightens when the neighbor arrives bearing the map, forcing Lina to recognize her work’s living echo. Pressure grows accumulatively: each portrait widens the circle of reciprocity until the city itself responds. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal endurance versus doubt, resolved in earned stasis. Cost is the ongoing insomnia and anonymity she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: portraits left without signature, gifts returned without explanation. The final silence over mint tea offers a non-literal answer—kindness is a language that survives namelessness. Subtext lives in gesture (the neighbor’s mottled palms, the single gold dot). No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the alley portraits glowing at dawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and insomnia-sharp: “saffron quiet,” “moonlight parceled into thin, forgiving coins.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with the moon’s cadence; compression is purposeful. No head-hopping; every perception is filtered through Lina’s sleepless attention. Dialogue is minimal but weighty—the neighbor’s nod and shared silence carry subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers scent, light, and texture without redundancy. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent—moonlight as coin, brush as river mouth. No loops or scaffold; information is multiplexed. Rhythm modulates from languid to hushed stillness at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—anonymously painting kindness portraits to seed urban tenderness—feels fresh yet inevitable. The moon-tipped brush as conduit of memory and the greenhouse as micro-republic are specific inventions, not ornaments. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure; payoff is the wordless communion over tea. Transformation test: the story would collapse if any element were generic.</comment>
