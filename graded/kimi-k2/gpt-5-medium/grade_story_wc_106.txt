<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The thief’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“breath carried a hush of luminous disbelief”), motives escalate from curiosity to restorative gift-giving, and the final renunciation of theft is earned by the mentor’s visible cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s sudden reappearance feels slightly under-motivated, nudging the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonbeams re-animate the negatives, crystallizing the shift from stealing to returning. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. One micro-drag: the bouquet’s “second mouth” moment edges toward overwriting but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The emerald station, freight door, and moonlit rails are tactile and constraining; the jar’s light literally guides the path. Micro-setting (jar, bouquet, door) functions as setting and tool, charging the final image. A hairline slip: spatial choreography around the freight door could be crisper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the thief restore what was stolen—tightens once when the mentor asks to “reinterpret the debt.” Agency drives escalation; cost is visible in the mentor’s gauntness and the blank negatives. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of capturing light versus allowing astonishment. Final image of portraits “no longer stolen, only kept until their owners arrived” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in flower grammar and moth choreography deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light and scent. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous disbelief”) is consistent with the narrator’s vocation and does not drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“lake’s worth of unspent horizon”—barely grazes clarity but occurs outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “golden-hour portrait thief” premise is fresh; the inversion from theft to restoration feels inevitable in hindsight. Moonbeam jar and flower codes synthesize into a singular mythic logic. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
