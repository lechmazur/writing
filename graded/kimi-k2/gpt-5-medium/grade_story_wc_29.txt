<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“palms tingled,” “breathed in dust and stubbornness”), but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized until late; the final renunciation lands with felt cost yet leans on summary rather than live contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s refusal to accept tenure crystallizes the new stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is legible in the dean’s “relief” and the stray thought that “finally blinked.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The radio booth, theater roof, and quad function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the hiss-to-breath shift in the final image recharges the subsonic motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resisting the manipulative signal—tightens once when the dean refuses diagnostics; the protagonist’s broadcast of countersigns forces a visible trade-off (tenure foregone) under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete struggle over breath and listening; the final annotation “teach people their breath” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer that reweights the entire pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, compressed, and lyrically consistent; patterned elision (“static had tempers; silence had accents”) is taught early and paid off in the hiss-to-breath cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional figurative layering (“visions of victory like sugar into water”) risks overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddles the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-trickster premise is transformed through the specific university-radio frame and subsonic mechanics; the synthesis feels inevitable and the risk of lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
