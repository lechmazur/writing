<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulses—yearning to protect the hush yet confessing “I am just the last person who said yes”—are dramatized through micro-choices like stacking stones and pressing sea glass. The final renunciation (five stones for love, one shell for the absent keeper) carries visible cost and forecloses escape. Secondary pressure from the skipper is present but light; his reticence limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of letters, stones, and sea glass intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the ache that shines enough to guide”—with felt cost in the keeper’s endurance. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One transition (skipper’s arrival) is clean and serves the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is the lantern room itself—micro-setting that constrains every move: birds in darkness, candle stub, stacked stones. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath”). The sea glass on the sill charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bottling safety via anonymous letters—tightens when the lamp dies mid-storm; the keeper’s only agency is to keep writing and stacking. One meaningful deepening: the realization that safety is “the ache that shines.” Cost is the perpetual vigil; no external rescue is sought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety as communal ache, not absence of loss. Subtext in stone counts and unsigned letters avoids moralizing. Final image of five stones and candle smoke offers resonant, non-literal answer without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “tidepool holding sunlight without saying what it reflects.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No dialogue beyond fragmentary exchange with skipper; internal monologue stays within POV knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during storm, longer cadences in reflection. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—anonymous letter chain maintained by stone code—feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of “three stones danger, four soup, five love” transforms familiar lighthouse trope. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in final reconfiguration.</comment>
