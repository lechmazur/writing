<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“cold rings of reflected breath”); the illustrator’s patience vs. fear tension drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—letting the larva go—pays the cost of borrowed time and is earned by prior obsession. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence pattern builds, breaks, and reweights meaning at closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time snaps back, illustrator left with truer drawing and debt. Cost is legible in “the nap tug the seconds from my cuffs.” No orientation drift; spatial anchors clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, sluice, and pendant form a micro-setting that actively constrains tactics; water’s hush-rush cadence is both stage and antagonist. Sensory hierarchy matches illustrator’s priorities—sound and touch over sight. Final image of lichens and clouds guides returners, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vs. release of nascent echo—is signaled early and tightened when the oval widens. One decisive turn: closing the pendant to free the larva, paying with lost seconds. Pressure escalates via cadence break and widening time-debt; cost is visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs. possession emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. The interrupted cadence motif reweights from obsession to stewardship at closure. Final image of “drawing truer than my eye” offers non-literal resonance without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature of a patient observer (“I trusted observations, shadows, and stubborn ink”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for lull, fragments for rupture. No POV drift; diction stays within lexicon of an illustrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern (“two ponds contemplating their shared shore”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and grounded in physical logic of water and breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses natural history, time-bending, and acoustic ecology in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
