<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the contradiction between “blessed” and “pariah” is dramatized through micro-choices like dating the blackout and blowing on the line. The final renunciation—trusting the self-drawn north—earns its cost from prior guilt and isolation. A hairline slip: the phrase “unlucky luck” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sky-sketches and slowed time reweights the stake until the final Charged Poise (“I had made a navigable field”). Closure lands with felt cost—the solitude of being right—anchored in the blackout date. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The deck’s dilated time actively constrains every tactical choice—stars peel slowly, ink dries at glacial speed—charging the final image. Micro-setting (compass applique against sternum) doubles as tool and map. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding a personal true north after catastrophe—tightens once when the constellations misalign and the protagonist chooses to layer sketches rather than fix a single bearing. Cost is visible: ongoing exile and the headache under bone. Agency drives the turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of navigation versus fixity emerges organically from the act of sketching drifting stars; no moralizing. The final image—“a vein of intention through the stretched hours”—reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the grandmother’s warning about needles and ground deepens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is precise (“dust hesitated between falling and floating”). Patterned elision of time is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within the narrator’s lexicon even under metaphysical stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional elevated phrasing (“cathedral abandoned mid hymn”) risks register drift yet remains voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. One mixed metaphor—“candle of breath”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics, family ritual, and post-disaster guilt feels inevitable and fresh. The compass rose as four-armed map of time is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric dilation is fully committed and coherent; no retreat to safer exposition.</comment>
