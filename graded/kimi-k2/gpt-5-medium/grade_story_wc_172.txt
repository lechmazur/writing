<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—sentiment vs. amorality—are dramatized in the egg-lowering beat; the final slackening in his spine registers cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent. The memory of the child at the museum tilts his present stance, satisfying BRR. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s powder release reweights the premise from preservation to audible forgiveness. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the cadence toward the final hum. Cost is legible in the sting of salt on his palm. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt flat’s crystalline lacerations, the oculus, and the tuning fork’s tone are not backdrop but instruments that constrain placement and resonance. Micro-setting (egg suspended in fishing-line net) charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure; thunder lull functions as live clock. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—audible preservation vs. ecological guilt—tightens once through the egg’s dissolution and the chamber’s hum. Escalation is accretive: each archival birdcall layers pressure until the final slackening. Cost is visible in the egg’s vanishing and the sting of salt. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of hoarding echoes while erasing life; no moral is stated. The final image—powder drifting like frost while speakers answer with chorus—reweights the premise without abstraction. Subtext operates in the withheld memory of the child and the denied tear. Complexity lingers: forgiveness is “nearly” granted, not granted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under thunder pauses. Perceptual signature is distinct: “sentiment bought wholesale and resold the packaging.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Compression taught early (“salt flat held its breath”) pays off in the final “breathing pause.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“corridors need music to stay”—and serve theme. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” academicism is offset by voice consistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—using engineered drought to archive vanished birdsong—is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test: story collapses if salt flat or egg is swapped. Risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specific synthesis of ecology, guilt, and sound feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
