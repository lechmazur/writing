<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“luminescent ache I could not name”), but the final renunciation—“I would build… but only as an echo of the posture”—is slightly under-cooked; the cost of dedicating his practice is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses (to graft vs. to listen until “tenderized”) play out in scene, and the posture-as-arbor crystallizes a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living ring of bodies becomes the new arbor, reweighting the premise that a structure must be built. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard of gossip, chalk mark, and mirrored face layers density until the final hush. Cost is legible in the ache that “now glowed like a lantern meant for many hands,” a felt social price for shared guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The crystalline orchard is not backdrop; its mirrored fruit literally reflects townsfolk back at themselves, forcing participation. The crater’s “singing bowl” resonance at twilight supplies the final cadence shift. Environment constrains choice—only by learning the orchard’s “grammar” can the sculptor proceed—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—grafting into community—tightens through each micro-choice: answering Farrin, threading reeds, leaning into the curve. The deepening is accumulative rather than causal, but the final ring of bodies forecloses solitary authorship, exacting the cost of perpetual tending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between solitary making and communal posture; the final image of “breath and posture and willingness” offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The word “Together” scratched in obsidian reweights every prior shard of gossip into a living covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile craft: “marsh-reed sculptor,” “stardust sugar,” “reed twist shaped like an ear.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell—long breaths for dawn hush, clipped fragments during the search. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image does double duty (“mirrored fruit reflecting their own moving faces”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during the communal lean, then exhales into the final hush. One mixed metaphor—“crater held a mouthful of unsung lullabies”—is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a posture-as-arbor feels inevitable yet fresh; the crystalline orchard and obsidian shards transform familiar “community rebuilding” into luminous specificity. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the living ring replaces architecture without gimmickry.</comment>
