<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist is vivid—embodied flashlight, cold archives, ethical strain—but internal friction stays largely thematic; the choice to surface Aida’s voice earns the arc yet feels narrated rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative structure teaches its drift-pattern early, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the Sink revelation; causality is clear within the poem-code but leans metaphorical more than procedural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The server-cold, metadata-smell micro-setting constrains every beat; the archive’s chill and digital hush form an atmospheric pressure that charges the final image of the printed patch talisman.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes hinge on “voice vs policy silence” and escalate through each breadcrumb; the decision to release the files tightens options with visible job-risk, earning a high-band but quiet pivot rather than explosive twist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unseen erasure versus stewardship surfaces through motif accretion; the final non-moralizing reprise (“surf answered like surf”) reweights prior material with conceptual cost on corporate denial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archival-curator idiom—metallic hum, cold metadata, flashlight idleness—remains consistent; compression and patterned elision work under pressure, no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric cadence propels mood; occasional metaphor stacks (“ash over ocean mourned in playlists”) skirt overwriting but never obscure causality; clean mechanics, zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar tech-corp ghost-story into specific archive elegy; the telemetry-heartbeat map on Flight 7421 is an unexpected synthesis that charges both grief and data-ethics.</comment>
