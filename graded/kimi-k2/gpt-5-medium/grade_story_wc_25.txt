<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivo’s embodied knowledge of gait, his tactile map-folding, and the coin-as-pause create a coherent interiority; the wager with Rade crystallizes a value hierarchy (quiet craft over brute noise) with visible social cost when Rade capitulates. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, but the final choice is earned and forecloses the “shout” path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard silence after the gate opens reconfigures power between Ivo and Rade, cost paid in Rade’s surrendered authority. Causal chain—storm disables tech → Ivo leverages acoustic properties of steel → courier guided by whisper—holds under a Causal lens without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: corrugations become acoustic channels, crane positions dictate foldable corridors, gate hinge vibration guides the key insertion. Sensory selection (metallic taste, citrus air) is filtered through Ivo’s professional priorities and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers outrun shouts—is signaled early and tightened once: Rade’s acceptance of the wager raises social stakes, then the gate’s silent opening forces Rade’s concession. Cost is Rade’s loss of face; no external coincidence resolves the search.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of attention versus force emerges from the concrete acoustic tactics; no explicit moralizing. Final line (“steel carries murmurs like rivers, if you listen for the bend”) offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Ivo’s synesthetic “tasting metallic weather,” his coin-tracing habit, and the rhythmic brass-key song create a tactile, auditory POV. Voice modulates under pressure—syntax shortens during the gate persuasion—without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with rhythmic variation; figurative language (“maps were origami logic”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; spatial choreography of courier threading through containers is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: maintenance worker as acoustic navigator, geomagnetic storm disabling tech to foreground human pattern-recognition. Risk in quiet climax pays off; premise feels inevitable in hindsight rather than gimmicky.</comment>
