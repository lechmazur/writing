<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—claustrophobia vs compulsion to move—drives every beat; embodied dread (“old tightness rise behind my ribs”) and micro-choices (chalk, pricking stone) keep motive active. The final threading of the key onto the cord crystallizes a stance with visible cost: defiance of the Council. One slip: “wistful rebellion” is named rather than dramatized in the last paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (organ chord, chalk mark, compass prick) tightens the spatial mutiny until the telescope’s downward gaze reweights the city as listener. Closure is a Charged Poise—the city’s “hunger to be heard” acknowledged—cost paid by the protagonist’s outlaw status. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus, fountain silt, and the Observatory telescope are not backdrop but instruments that constrain tactics; the cracked tile and silt-cold key charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (sound of organ over sight) mirrors POV bias. One minor drift: “streets whisper in broken measures” leans generic amid otherwise precise detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key against spatial rebellion—escalates through textured accumulation: alleys shift, lungs flutter, Council’s ban looms. The tightening occurs when the organ’s chord transfixes the triangle, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: the key’s recovery brands the protagonist a trespasser.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs fixing emerges organically: the city’s “mutiny” reframed as plea. Final image—telescope aimed downward—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the sexton’s unseen favor and the grandmother’s compass avoids exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and POV-locked: “stone recognized its own slow lungs.” Compression taught early (“thinning velvet”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within explorer’s lexicon. One elevated phrase—“elaborate shrugs”—is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise: “key with teeth shaped like constellations.” Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” but fits reflective beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spatial rebellion, church acoustics, and cartographic magic feels inevitable and fresh. Risky second-person city-as-character gambit succeeds because it shapes tactics. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
