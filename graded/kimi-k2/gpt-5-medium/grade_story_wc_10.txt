<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the survivor’s need to “translate silence into music” drives every micro-choice. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope—co-exist in the same beats, and the final “permission to continue” is earned through visible effort and cost. The only limit to 9+ is the absence of a second on-page character to test status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance crystallizes in the final image of carrying the case “like a lantern.” Accumulative lens holds—each sensor sweep and fork placement layers density until the ending reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the closing nod to “reciprocal quiet.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is not backdrop; its frost, ribs, and light actively constrain tactics and are recharged in the final “new lines that wait for meanings.” Micro-setting of tuning forks and mirrors functions as extension of body and choice. One hairline slip: “city drifts like a slow parade” momentarily floats without spatial tether.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rectifying silence into shareable wonder—tightens through each heat-map calibration; the “nation of wrong readings” beat forces algorithmic revision with visible cost. Escalation is accumulative: every fork placement and leaf weight narrows options until the final stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: translation as survival, wonder as discipline. Subtext lives in gesture and light, never sermon. Final image of “unshaken marvels ourselves” reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the survivor’s synesthetic urgency. Syntax modulates with pressure—“disciplined tides,” “animal heat”—without purple drift. No head-hop; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and information. Occasional stacked metaphors (“antlers caught perpetually before the strike”) risk overwriting but are pattern-taught early and pay off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—music after silence, wonder after disaster—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because closure remains legible and charged.</comment>
