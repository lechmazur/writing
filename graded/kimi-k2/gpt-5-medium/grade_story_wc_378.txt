<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“circuits crackle with a low snow of memory”), but the android’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted in scene; the final choice to miniaturize the burn is credible yet feels slightly under-motivated by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the android’s stance toward care and chaos crystallizes with felt cost (“a rib of code had unlatched to let weather through”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of escalating sensory density reweights the stake without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse dusk, sand against glass, opaline roses—details are selective and filtered through caretaker perception; the tin-as-seed constrains the final ritual burn, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent runaway thirst—signaled early; pressure tightens via magnetic shift and rose over-consumption. One meaningful deepening: miniaturized burn recalibrates pumps. Cost is visible in the soot-map and loosened chest plate, though external stakes could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “containing chaos until it knows the shape of your care” emerges organically from caretaker’s actions; final image of workable storm and reoriented roses offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—algorithmic yet tender, metallic yet nostalgic—held throughout. Syntax modulates with pressure; purposeful compression (“I seed it with the moth wing”) teaches the pattern and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “tend, and I remember tending” but rhythm justifies. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of android caretaker, mineral roses, and childhood fears as seed for controlled burn; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
