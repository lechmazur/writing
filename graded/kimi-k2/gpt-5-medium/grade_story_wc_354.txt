<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the tutor’s exile, the girl’s silence, and their shared chess logic all drive micro-choices. The final surrender of the king is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor drift: the girl’s interiority is inferred rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone set in the hollow reconfigures the covenant’s meaning with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silence translated into chess moves tightens until the field “listens.” No orientation debt; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus, monoliths, and the basalt stone are vivid, selective, and constrain choices (stone fits hollow, field hum guides moves). Micro-setting doubles as tool and constraint. One minor spatial blur: exact relation of slab to monoliths not tracked, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how difficult beauty survives—tightens through each silent move; the girl’s final check forces the tutor’s surrender, narrowing options with visible cost. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty is not silence imposed but silence shared in play. Final image of the hollow no longer begging to be filled reweights the covenant without moralizing. Subtext in pauses and stone placements is precise and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature (“counting rain by its absences”) is consistent. Compression and elision taught early (“I had walked all day…”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than clutter. No loops or scaffold. One near-mixed metaphor (“wind uncaught by turbines braided through grass”) but resolved within line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess pedagogy as method for renegotiating a geomagnetic covenant. Risky lyric structure holds; stone-as-piece and silence-as-notation feel inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
