<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is particular—raw memory of anesthesia, tactile palms, loam-scented breath. Motivation deepens: opening wounds to reach closure while recoiling from being right. Micro-choice—cracking the hourglass—pays visible cost yet the moment feels fractionally under-cooked, cost stated more than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure unit earns Conceptual Repricing: pouring sand and planting ivy reweights guilt into stewardship. Drive is Accumulative/Textural—density of coffee-ring imagery, “meteor hush”: these patterns reconfigure meaning rather than causally solve. Causality holds; cost (“loam and apology” taste) is legible on the page.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quiet tower, frosted hourglass, tunnel debris, ivied chamber—all vivid, selective. Hourglass in hand becomes body extension constraining the final offer; tunnel air as “held breath” charges the choice that follows. No spatial drift; anchor early.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake: turn guilt into living action under plant-whispered weight. Tightening: decision to enter tunnel and pour sand narrows options; felt cost (emptying the last time-grained token) crystallizes. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of salvage—closure as garden, not gate—emerges from ivy uptake, fossilized ring, displaced miracle’s second life. Avoids explicit moral, resonates through final gesture and hush-break “garden learned slowly.” Slight hint of statement in final paragraph’s phrasing, but stays beneath overt sermonizing.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“meteor hush stitched by needles of light,” sensory signatures belong to one mind. Pattern of plant-whispering taught and paid off at closure; no POV slippage. Minor lilt of elevated diction at peaks, but rhythmically motivated.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</comment>Prose flows without loops; figurative density serves rather than clots. “Take back what you can” is concise; each phrase multi-tasks (image + motive). Only brief moment of stacked metaphor inside one beat, not enough to dull impact.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment>Fresh synthesis: botanical telepathy plus forensics-by-coffee-rings, miracle misfire as metaphysical CPR, all grounded in palpable grief. No familiar trope left unchanged; risk heightens without obscuring clarity.</question>
