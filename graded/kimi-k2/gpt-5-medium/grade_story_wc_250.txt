<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interiority is embodied and specific; the brother’s suicide and the narrator’s shame are anchored in tactile moments. The guardian’s silence and micro-gestures create credible pressure, and the final acceptance of the mirror carries visible cost. Minor slip: “spiralingly calm” leans toward label, not lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator’s stance crystallizes when the dental mirror is handed over, reweighting the stake of teaching darkness its stars. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each reflected glint deepens the pattern until the final shimmer refuses the brother’s pull. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slick stone, and shuttered houses constrain every move; the dental mirror itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Weather and architecture guide choice without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to keep the brother’s darkness from winning—tightens through each reflected syllable. Escalation is accretive: each shutter pattern raises the emotional ante until the mirror’s beam becomes a narrow road the narrator must walk. Cost is felt when shame “tried retreating.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: light as fragile refusal of despair. Subtext lives in gesture and reflection; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. The story invites multiple readings—mourning, forgiveness, or ongoing vigil—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent and pressure-responsive. Non-standard syntax (“spiralingly calm”) is pattern-taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Occasional stacked metaphors (“bruised clouds,” “shy throat cleared”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: canal guardian as silent psychopomp, dental mirror as star-teacher. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric silence, accumulative patterning) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
