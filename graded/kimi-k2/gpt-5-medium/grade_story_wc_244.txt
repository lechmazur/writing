<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The logistician’s jocular exhaustion and sleep-for-maps trade-off give a sharp, embodied interiority; the final slip of the moon rock into a child’s pocket crystallizes a tender, costly choice. Yet the “we” chorus diffuses individual contradiction, keeping the arc communal rather than personal. Still, motives align with action throughout, and the renunciation of name carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the midnight trolley arrives neighbor-powered, reconfiguring the promise of the “train that only carried conversations and soup.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of kindness rituals tightens until the final image reweights the premise with communal agency. One transition (station → rain walk) is legible; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The ivy-choked station is tactile—ivy, chalk, lantern tea—each detail constraining logistics (blank postcards weighed by moon rock). Micro-setting (leaky skylight) funnels candlelight into routes. Weather and decay are not backdrop but active pressure shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—cure loneliness via reciprocity—tightens through each ladle, postcard, and returned thermos. No single reversal, but the escalating density of favors owed/ offered narrows options until the final trolley embodies the earned network. Cost is visible: the logistician’s anonymity and the moon rock’s transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from logistics of kindness: “science of kindness moving reliably from hand to hand.” The moon rock’s final re-gifting reframes the entire ledger of favors as a living reciprocity without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (shy applause, whispered gift) carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, collective first-person “we” is stable; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates—long breaths for wonder, clipped lists for logistics. Diction stays within communal vernacular; no register drift. Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“laughter scattered like sparrows”) are precise and earned. Minor over-figuration in one or two lines does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster logistics as tender anarchy, rumors as supply chains, moon rock as speaking token. The premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky collective POV and lyric accumulation pay off in communal closure without gimmickry.</comment>
