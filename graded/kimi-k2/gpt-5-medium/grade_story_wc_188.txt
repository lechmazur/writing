<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the fireworks designer’s filtering of fuel, mapping of wind, and micro-choice to “keep the wall awake” reveal a coherent, risk-attuned persona. The relationship with Lark is brief but functions as crucible: her trust in the knot and their shared pact crystallize the final stance. Motivation—defying hopelessness through “serious play”—is dramatized, not stated, and the earned stasis (tying the knot back into patience) carries visible cost. Minor slip: Lark’s voice is not fully distinct from narrator’s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final comet’s green hush reweights the fortress’s silence into “what remained possible,” with the keeper’s straightened posture and ash-drinking blooms as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mortar answers the mosaic’s eighth-note pattern, tightening cadence until the night itself becomes staff paper. Orientation is anchored by dusk arrival and no-stars hush; no causality breaks. One transition (dusk → iron night) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro-grained: moonflowers as “listening mouths,” vines parting like “shy fingers,” and the cistern’s wind funnel all constrain placement of mortars. The mosaic note and kerosene rag knot act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (smell of fuel, taste of salt-petal mix) is filtered through professional bias. Environment directly shapes tactics; no static postcarding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling collective hope without speech—tightens when the no-stars hush becomes literal pressure. Each mortar placement is a micro-choice that forecloses silence; the final comet’s green hush is the decisive intensification with visible cost (ash on children’s hands). Escalation is accumulative: pattern density rises until the fortress “breathed with an orchard’s patience.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act itself: play as prayer, instruction as light. The mosaic eighth-note is not a symbol but a constraint that shapes the mortar sequence; its final trace across the dark reweights the premise that silence equals despair. Subtext in the keeper’s “keys bright as fruit” and vines “laughing like old aunties” avoids moralizing. Final image of blooms drinking ash offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “humming the road,” “measuring the air with my feet,” “polite as a messenger with wild news.” Syntax mirrors the fireworks designer’s metronomic intuition; patterned elision (“filtered the burned smell from memory”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue with Lark is minimal but carries subtext: “I thought the knot belonged to a disappeared uncle.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“jasmine poured down like a gentle waterfall”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates with mortar count, then exhales in the final green hush. One near-slip: “the hush of a night with no stars” is slightly redundant, but the cadence earns it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—fireworks as silent speech against despair—is non-obvious and fully committed. The kerosene rag knot, mosaic note, and “serious playfulness” synthesize into a singular artistic stance. Risk: lyric elliptical structure could have collapsed into gimmickry, but the closure remains legible and charged. Specificity of salts and petals grounds the concept in tactile reality.</comment>
