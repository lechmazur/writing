<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the carver’s meditative stance and grief-work are credibly strained by each micro-choice. The spectral mentorship sharpens rather than softens decisions, forcing pauses and depth-changes that carry cost. The father’s presence supplies relational pressure, but the arc remains single-POV and earns its quiet renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly returns, butterfly loom, and ribbon reprises tighten the emotional quilt until the final spare curve reweights every prior stone. Closure is a Charged Poise—the kite-curve crystallizes options and leaves the cost of unfinished work humming in the glass. No orientation drift; causality is lyric but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse breathes as micro-setting: condensation planets, glowing dirt, cracked panes that admit drafts and butterflies all constrain carving tempo and silence. The bench, ribbon, and chisel form a tactile triad that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; no static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carve collective grief without breaking it—tightens through each stone and the father’s presence. Migration clock and nightly return pattern escalate pressure; the final kite-curve forecloses ornament in favor of spare mercy. Cost is visible in unfinished quilt and withheld depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grief as migrating tide, names needing silence, poems traded like bread. Final kite-curve offers non-literal answer—art must release, not cage. No moralizing; resonance lingers in glass and soil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary, tidal, and consistent; perceptual signature notices “glass ribs singing like tide” and “commas trembling with the authority of mercy.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; spectral hush is rendered as gust, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Rhythm modulates with chisel taps and butterfly pauses. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—gravestone carver in greenhouse guided by dead mother via butterflies and poems—feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure. Specificity of kite-curve and ribbon notches prevents template drift.</comment>
