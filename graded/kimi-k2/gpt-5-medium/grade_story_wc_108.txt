<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“cataloged fears like injuries”), but the brother’s motivation remains abstract—why he hid and why he now needs rescue are asserted rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“I would keep falling, but now toward us”), satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist reclaims identity and redefines “falling” as connection. Causal chain holds—each decoded clue tightens options—though the brother’s off-stage plan edges coincidence. Cost is legible in the trembling, the sweat-slick dial, and the forfeiture of the stolen credits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library breathes iron and tide; the child’s galaxy-painted cast and the skylight ladder constrain the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true (“memory scraping against sky”). Environment is not mere backdrop; it supplies the lock and the ladder that enable the reunion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove vulnerability is power—tightens once the cast’s cipher forces a public reckoning. Escalation is causal: each decoded line narrows escape routes and raises social cost. The final plan to “write our own billing” crystallizes agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: stunt injuries as ledger, betrayal as inverted gift. Final image of tracing “new notes, clearer, even with shaking hands” reweights vulnerability from liability to currency without moralizing. Complexity lingers—brother’s theft both saved and stole lives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and idiosyncratic (“tidebreath,” “fear-sweat”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off: the shell’s shift from silence to syllables mirrors the protagonist’s arc. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional near-abstractions (“transformative betrayal twisted again”) flirt with overwriting but are anchored by embodied detail. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—stunt double discovering his life is borrowed—feels fresh and inevitable. The child’s cast as cipher device and the shell as oracle synthesize genre tropes into lived detail. Risk-taking (lyric elision, off-stage brother) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
