<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist’s motive—preserve small moments—drives every micro-choice; interiority is embodied in ink, tide, and salt. The woman’s tremor and locket anchor her stakes, but her interior contradiction is reported rather than dramatized. Final renunciation (stepping back) is earned and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the regenerated covenant breathes through proximate causes, not decree. Causal lens holds from tide to final locket click; cost is the archivist’s relinquishment of reunion. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, thrift, barnacles, and warm boards constrain pacing and memory retrieval; the locket photo becomes micro-setting that reweights meaning. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. Final image of lantern-like locket charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can small moments be preserved against erasure—tightens when the man’s silhouette appears; escalation is situational pressure crystallizing stance. Cost is the archivist’s self-exclusion and the woman’s unspoken risk. One decisive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory as tide, covenant rebuilt by proximate causes. No moralizing; final image of locket-as-lantern reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—walnut ink, salt, thrift—sustained under pressure. POV modesty maintained; no head-hop. Compression and elision taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. One mixed metaphor (“white parenthesis”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival memory as tidal covenant repair. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Specificity of walnut ink and barnacle alphabets anchors universals.</comment>
