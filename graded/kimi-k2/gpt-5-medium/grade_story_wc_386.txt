<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation as ghost-whisperer is embodied through tactile choices—cutting portholes, braiding offerings, decoding taps—each action rooted in a consistent, self-imposed ethic of “weaving truth carefully.” Interiority is concrete (“felt the grid of Sofia’s rhythm in my palms”), and the final refusal to shout but instead invite the dreamers crystallizes a cost: silence chosen over spectacle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shrine becomes a courtroom, the globe’s clicks a metered hymn that forces the company’s public reckoning. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each dream-cameo, tap, and candle-breath layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible when the foreman “lowered his eyes” under torchlight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is micro-precise: the glacier shrine’s “candle-lit” ice, “black water” beyond portholes, and the ferry’s “ribs where cabins gape like pulled teeth” all constrain movement and mood. The melted snow globe, warmed between lamplight and breath, becomes a portable setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surfacing the ferry’s true cause—tightens through each decoded tap and dream-cameo. Escalation is accretive: from rumor to rhythm to recorded password. The final cadence shift—town windows flickering in unison—forces the company’s stance crystallization with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the ethics of salvage: truth must be coaxed, not wrenched, from wreckage. The melted globe’s blurred city and rusted crank embody memory’s fragility and culpability. The ending’s quiet indictment—no cheers, just lowered eyes—invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “breath makes halos,” “salt-stiffened coat,” “milky bruise.” Syntax mirrors the diver’s slowed perception underwater, then tightens during decoding. No POV drift; every image is filtered through the narrator’s professional bias and grief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: “I dive at dawn, when the sky brightens like an eyelid” compresses time and emotion. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—metaphors serve the maritime lexicon without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—wreck-diver ghost-whisperer decoding posthumous Morse via dreams—is fresh yet inevitable. The transformation of a child’s snow globe into forensic evidence is a non-obvious synthesis that feels predestined. Risk-taking (lyric accretive structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
