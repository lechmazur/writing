<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interiority is embodied and specific—“I measure days by the weight of names”—and his stubborn endurance is dramatized through the meticulous lens-mending. The final promise to the dead carries a felt cost: he etches his mortuary stamp into the desk, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon’s new signal reweights the premise from “return” to “stay,” and the cost is the undertaker’s permanent exile below. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers pressure until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library’s glass dome, kelp-filtered light, and floating books constrain every choice—mirrors must be scavenged from covers, plankton vents limit lens placement. The setting itself becomes the permanent address, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“give rest a permanent address”—tightens when the manual demands impossible spaces and the mantled sea tests the dome. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each shard aligned narrows options until the SOS becomes SOR.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the undertaker’s labor: rest as location, not surrender. The final beacon pattern answers the distress signals without moralizing, reweighting grief into stewardship. Ambiguity lingers—will the sea wait again?—yet the image resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a salt-weathered elegy—“waterlogged names,” “kelp tea and candles”—with rhythmic control that tightens under pressure. Compression like “chased stillness” teaches the pattern early; the final hush lands as earned cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “the room brightens with cautious algae light” does triple duty—setting, mood, plot beat. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent within the maritime lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—a drowned library as post-office for the dead—is non-obvious yet inevitable. The broken lens repurposed as mosaic beacon transforms the trope of guiding lights into an act of staying. Specificity anchors the uncanny.</comment>
