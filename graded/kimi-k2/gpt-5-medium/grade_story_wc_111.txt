<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vine-dresser’s interiority is textured and embodied; his pragmatic patience and quiet guilt over the planted marble drive every beat. The final kneel and confession feel earned because earlier rituals and cracks in his hands foreshadow the cost. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the maze accepts his mended deception as penance, the vine tastes its own history, and the gate is left unlatched—cost is the relinquishing of control. Causal chain holds: planted lie → maze’s objection → confession → acceptance. Lens is Causal; every beat links by therefore/because.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden, dials, cracked marbles, and vine shadow are vivid, selective, and constrain choices—marbles align with hand scars, vine presses the dial. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and light evolve with emotional pressure. One notch off 9+ only because the fountain’s geography could be one sentence sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove the garden remembers”—is tested when the maze exposes the false marble. Escalation tightens once: confession or banishment. Cost is visible: relinquishing the polished illusion and accepting the cracked self. Agency drives every turn; luck complicates but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship versus manipulation emerges through concrete ritual and the final image of gardener and garden exchanging nods. No moralizing; the cracked marbles reweight the premise in silence. Resonant ambiguity lingers: mercy and deception braided, not judged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is weathered, horticultural, quietly sly—“timid beetles under glass,” “silver breath but would not speak.” Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final unlatched gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and consistent—“constellations of stubborn care.” Rhythm breathes with the scene’s pulse. No artifacts in peak beats; closure image is crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of measurable luck reframed as garden memory is fresh; execution is grounded in tactile ritual. The mended deception trope is inverted—garden judges the gardener. Specificity of cracked marbles and vine leash makes the concept inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
