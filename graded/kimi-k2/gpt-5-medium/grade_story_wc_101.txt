<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s gentle persistence is embodied in nightly micro-choices—ringing the bell once, pairing teens with elders, standing silent under the arbor—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete: “our nerves stretched thin,” “silence ringing harder than any alarm.” The final stance crystallizes with cost: she polishes the bell until “our faces wobbled there,” a renunciation of anonymity that still carries risk. One slip: the collective “we” occasionally dilutes single-POV interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell rehung where “the wind could ring thanks” reconfigures the community’s stance from secrecy to open gratitude, cost visible in the relinquished safety of anonymity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each donated gift layers density until the final image reweights the braid of scarcity and care. Orientation is swift; causality intact. Minor ellipsis in patrol timeline does not fracture the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor, frost prints, and silver bell form a micro-setting that constrains every tactic: hidden tracks dissolve under moonlight, the bell’s single ring times the hand-offs. Sensory selection narrows under curfew pressure—“boots creaking,” “breath-white arbor.” Final image of the bell breathing frost charges the closure. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival without betrayal—tightens when the patrol demands names; Mara’s refusal crystallizes the cost of open gratitude. Escalation is accumulative: each anonymous gift raises stakes until the patrol search. Agency remains communal; individual cost is felt but diffused through “we,” slightly blunting the personal price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid of scarcity and care; no moralizing, only the final image of faces wobbling in polished silver. Subtext lives in silence, the bell’s single ring, and the unspoken lists. The ending reweights anonymity into gratitude without a stated lesson. One near-theme line—“we will keep their dignity warm”—is earned by prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “a tide that returned even when the shoreline pretended it had no use for water.” Perceptual signature is collective but consistent; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with tension—long breaths in calm beats, clipped fragments under patrol glare. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without clutter: “the bell teaches them both to wait and how waiting becomes a way of holding.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevation in diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon of witness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—clandestine mutual aid—feels fresh through the bell’s single-ring protocol and the constellation code in the night book. Specificity of sanctions-era detail (rationed gas, smuggled pears) grounds the lyric frame. Risk in collective POV pays off by amplifying communal stakes.</comment>
