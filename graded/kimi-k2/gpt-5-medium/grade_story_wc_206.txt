<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s dread of dishonesty is embodied in bodily collapse and visceral restoration when truth is spoken; the sacrifice of the shadow is immediate and embodied cost, but the grandmother strand is summary rather than scene, softening interior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure arrives with crisp Conceptual Repricing when the borrowed dawn redefines city life by covenant of listening; every action is linked because/therefore to prior honesty or shadow-forfeit—light is granted only if citizens keep ears open (felt social cost).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The resonance chamber’s brass ribs and glowing floor glyphs physically pressurize negotiations; shadow-stepping happens on rafters that echo previous breaches—setting never drifts but also never actively dictates the final choice, holding the work just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single, dominant stake “recover the city’s light” intensifies scene-by-scene: each truthful admission tightens negotiation, and each echo of lullaby debt raises personal price until the final binding of listening leaves no option but to uphold vigilance—the cost is visible in perpetual shadow labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that mending requires admitting unhealed wrongs; each admission adds weight, culminating in the quiet promise that “listening” sustains light—no abstract statement replaces embodied covenant, and the chord of rust lingers as moral complexity rather than tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice remains a single, idiosyncratic current—“tuned like tin and pears”—with rhythmic variation that quickens under confession; no head-hop, no POV slide, and the lyric diction never compromises clarity, even at peak tension while the shadow nods solemnly from the rafters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is musical and lean, but dense metaphors occasionally stack three-high (“rivering chord,” “patina of memory”) just enough to blunt image precision; information remains clear and no mechanical loops, yet the final glow could sing more quietly without adornment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The covenant of rust as sentient, negotiable antagonist is fresh; grafting a sacrificial shadow to civic vigilance is an inventive re-weighting. Familiar tropes (philosopher’s stone, lullaby guilt) are transformed through craft-specific detail and sonic consequence rather than ornament.</comment>
