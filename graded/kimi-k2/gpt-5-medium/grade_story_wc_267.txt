<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority carries a palpable, embodied ache—”wires blooming little sparks,” “metronome of me”—that never reduces to label-speak. The protagonist’s stance remains one of earned endurance: choosing to listen, refusing to absolve the forced silence, paying with literal nerve-fire. Micro-choices (“bolts clicked into the bench,” leaving the faint print on cobalt glass) trace a hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density accumulates, pattern breaks at “I played easing, I played space,” reweighting safety itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—the walls release birds of winter, the silence is no longer forgiven, the price is the ache still firing in the wrist. No causality gaps; every drift of frost and breath pays into the final exhalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setting functions as a live constraint: radiator-teeth, cobalt sweat, fortress corridors breathe actual cold onto skin and tactics. The bolted bench and conch-spiral staircase physically narrow choices, guide posture, host the final image of permission fogged into glass.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: safety bought with unpardonable silence. A single, steady deepening: from arrival’s awe to the moment he chooses to remain, endure, and renegotiate the price. The felt cost is the continuing nerve-fire and the silence that will never apologize—visible at the last exhale.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: silence as confiscated song, safety as accumulating debt. Final image—fortress exhaling a warmer rule without a chord ever struck—reweights the premise without sermon. Every motif (bolts, breath-notation on glass, humming radiators) returns charged with new meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is a distilled, synesthetic hush—“glaciers taught patience,” “choral broken circuit.” Syntax coils and relaxes in sync with pain and discovery; no head-hop. Compression—”I played easing, played space”—is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves icy precision without frostbite: every sentence does triple duty—character, atmosphere, motion. Density is high, zero paraphrase loops. The only micro-repeats are purposeful (radiator clicks, breath on glass) and accumulate tension rather than dull it.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The conceit—monastery of enforced silence rehearsing forbidden music—feels entirely new yet thematically inevitable. The bolt that reseats a practice bench becomes a tiny revolution. Compression, cold, and choir are woven into one irreducible cloth; risk is taken and coherence preserved.</comment>
