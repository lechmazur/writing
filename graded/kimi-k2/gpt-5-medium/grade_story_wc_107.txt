<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic—his narrated breathing, the bookmark as proxy for absent technician—but the shift from “abandon” to caretaker is asserted rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat; the cost is present yet diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open manual at a self-authored chapter, vessels aligned where ice had been, the room now “holding” questions. Accumulative lens holds—each melt, each vessel adds density until the final image reweights the premise with felt caretaking cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Control-room details (cracked leather, thawing ice deltas) are filtered through Arlen’s glassblower’s eye; the kiln’s orange mouth and the bookmark’s softened ink constrain his choices and charge the final tableau, satisfying micro-setting use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning abandonment into sanctuary—tightens as ice retreats and vessels accumulate; the cost is the irreversible labor of arms that shake and the irreversible melt that forecloses retreat. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of care versus risk emerges through the glass eye that “refused to glare” and the manual left open for an absent rule-lover; no moralizing, only a resonant reconfiguration of abandonment into invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-narrative voice—ceremonial inventory, stage-magician cadence—remains consistent; patterned compression (“pair of pipette ghosts”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush under green lamps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor is selective (“lantern lighter than the dark it revealed”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned polar station + glassblower crafting sanctuary from melt and memory; the conceit feels inevitable, the risk of lyric excess is controlled, and the final image is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
