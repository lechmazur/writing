<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard as scar and compass externalizes guilt. Motive—recover the unbruised moment—drives every beat. Final renunciation (not deciding yet) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “cryptic medium” label drifts toward self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of water, glass, song tightens until final Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page—“I will share the hinge”—with relational cost legible. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mangrove, blackwater mirror, and shard function as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. No spatial drift; weather and tide act on choice. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the pre-decision moment—signaled early. Pressure deepens via condensation messages and spirit interrogation, narrowing to the final stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the reopened palm and the vow to carry witness. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus fleeing emerges organically from concrete events. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in condensation messages and heron comma is precise. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature in “rain learning a language” and “cathedral gave us its tooth.” No head-hopping. Compression and elision taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern and closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports breath and urgency. One near-purple line (“kindling trying to become fire”) barely grazes the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic shard, mangrove spirits, and condensation oracle feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
