<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The artisan’s embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure are vivid; her blindness is not a label but a tactical constraint that forces inventive water-bowl navigation. The final smile and depot’s answering “language of settled wheels” crystallize earned stasis with visible cost. Minor: Mirel remains functional rather than crucible-level, capping relationship depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s last landing and shared smile reweight the entire ritual, cost paid in the artisan’s spent calm and the depot’s unclenched rails. Causal chain holds—each bowl-reflection and tap sequence tightens options until coupling succeeds. Fog complication and mid-scene code patch provide one meaningful escalation without rupture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mist, depot, bowls, and drone form a tactile micro-setting that actively constrains tactics; fog erases landmarks, bowls become compass, drone arcs stitch visibility. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound of anchor chain, vibration of water—anchoring who/where early. Final image of “settled wheels” charges the entire atmospheric build.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode feedback into safe coupling—signaled in paragraph four and tightened once when fog thickens and numbers stumble. Agency remains artisanal: midair code patch and recalibrated drone beats force the decisive alignment. Cost is felt in the collective exhale and the artisan’s magnetic calm spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of perception beyond sight emerges organically from water-refraction mechanics and sonic mapping; no explicit moralizing. Final smile toward harbor offers non-literal resonance: mastery through vulnerability. Subtext in apprentice’s mirrored gesture deepens the shared ritual without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—metallic vowels, magnetic calm, silver arcs—remains coherent under pressure. POV stays tightly focalized; no head-hop. Compression (“she threads a patch…feels the circuit answer”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with fog-thick urgency and coupling calm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan using water-bowl sonar to guide freight coupling via hummingbird drone. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands legible closure. Specificity of copper braid patch and droplet Morse renders the premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
