<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is embodied in frost on lashes, thumb fighting a twist, and the hush-boom count; the sister memory tilts his stance, and the final renunciation—saving the remaining starlight—carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses (wait vs. act) coexist in scene. Minor slip: “demonstrates patience physically” is slightly label-like, but the body shows it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake exhales, aurora steps, orchard’s heartbeats become a guiding map—felt cost is the saved starlight and the irreversible path now open. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each object’s placement and pulse accumulation tighten toward the final braiding. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s ribs, frozen sap, and nickel-cold plate are not backdrop; they constrain movement (frost lashes, chilled cheek) and charge the final image when the plate becomes a borrowed vertebra. Micro-setting (ampoule, bark-eye) shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into usable maps—tightens once when the starlight braid fixes the route; the cost is the spent light and the irreversible guidance now released. Pressure grows via pattern density and pulse count; no coincidence resolves. Agency is the deliberate sealing and release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening to what still lives beneath silence emerges through concrete acts, never stated. The sister memory and the saved starlight reweight the premise: guidance exacts a living toll. Final image of exhaled lake and moving aurora offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“sap frozen mid-throb,” “safekept starlight, milk-pale and humming”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Compression and elision (e.g., ellipsis between orchard and lake) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density; every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “demonstrates patience physically” twice—slight redundancy—but does not obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: starlight as rationed compass, orchard as silent cardiograph, flash-paper as vanishing cartography. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image. Specificity prevents trope drift; the premise could not be transplanted without loss.</comment>
