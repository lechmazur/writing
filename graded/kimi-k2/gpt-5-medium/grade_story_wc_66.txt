<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—"measured devotion," "copying silence into parts"—and the promise to carry tempo forward is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The single POV holds; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cadence marker in the ribs reconfigures future listening with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dust, ash, and breath tightens to final image—without causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ember alcove, shortwave glow, and ash on the floor constrain choices (hiding the dial, scattering ash to form letters) and charge the final image. Micro-setting functions as crucible; only the 9+ gate’s “environment constrains choice” is met, not exceeded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“teach dust to tell stories”—is signaled early and tightens once when the broadcast demands a promise in return. Cost is legible: perpetual listening labor. No second reversal, but single deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-attention emerges from ash, breath, and ledger work; final image of pages turning themselves offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—music-copyist diction, tactile metaphors, disciplined rhythm—and sustains perceptual signature under pressure. Patterned elision (e.g., “sideways voice”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“rake cinders into vowels”). Metaphors are coherent and purposeful; no overwriting in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Famine-era ghost-broadcast premise is fresh; synthesis of musical notation, ash grammar, and pirate radio feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
