<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—preservation vs liberation—is embodied in micro-choices (warming the seal, feeding the duct) and culminates in a visible cost: the archive’s disciplined ice and the narrator’s future melt. Motives remain character-bound; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. The final “did not know if I had preserved it or set it free” crystallizes the unresolved tension with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the letter’s release reweights the city’s tacit grammar without a shouted manifesto. Causal chain—letter → duct → networks → glances—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the narrator’s forfeiture of archival purity. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “echoing library under snow” is not backdrop; its dormant conduits become the delivery system that enables the final act. Frost on glass, camera reroutes, and elevator chimes are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain tactics and charge the closing image. Micro-setting (brass furred like moss) doubles as tool and emotional mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release dangerous knowledge—tightens through one decisive escalation: the midnight grid reset becomes the single window for transmission. Agency is clear; cost (loss of professional certainty) is felt on the page. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maintenance as intimacy, archives as living tissue. The final image of frost blooming like a curtain call reweights the premise—preservation and liberation are not opposites but braided acts of care. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers as invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and consistent: “snow cooks silence differently,” “coughing history back at itself.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No POV drift; sensory signature remains archivist-cool yet quietly ravenous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence performs multiple jobs. Metaphors are precise (“frost furred the brass like patient moss”) and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm modulates with emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>A fresh synthesis: love letters as infrastructure schematics, civic surveillance rerouted by tenderness. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk (transmitting contraband through literal building veins) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity—voltage dies, backups—grounds the speculative leap.</comment>
