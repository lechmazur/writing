<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("my own heart thrummed between them"), micro-choices (tuning gates to the catenary) are causally tied to prior stakes, and the final renunciation of naming names carries visible social cost. The single POV remains coherent; the child’s brief presence supplies relational pressure without headcount clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the machinist’s refusal to expose the lovers forecloses vengeance and reconfigures the city’s future governance. Causal chain—encrypted glue → broker identification → gate retuning—holds under a Causal lens, and the final image of “patient power” crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s breathing and the mountain’s “slow inhalations” are not mere backdrop; the stone’s rhythm constrains every adjustment of the gates and charges the final lullaby. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the machinist’s professional attention to pressure and sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—equitable water flow versus geological stability—tightens through the discovery of sabotage and the ethical choice to protect forbidden love. One decisive turn: retuning the gates to the catenary that “the mountain would accept,” with the cost of permanent vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from the glue analysis and the machinist’s refusal to name culprits; the final image of “forgiveness traveling through families” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the child’s silence and the sugar-bitter residue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively tactile and rhythmic—“brass link clicking polite applause,” “syncopation against the stone’s slow inhalations”—and stays within the machinist’s lexicon. No head-hopping; compression and elision (“I understood the method at once”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers information without loops. Metaphors are precise—“dust glimmering like tiny verdicts”—and never obscure causality. Zero scaffold or paraphrase loops; cadence modulates with the mountain’s breathing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of hydrological engineering, cryptographic chemistry, and volcanic architecture feels inevitable and fresh. The “encrypted compassion” conceit is not gimmickry; it reconfigures civic ethics. Risk-taking (lyric causality, non-human breathing setting) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
