<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“exile curl tight around my throat”), but the prince backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly dilutes present pressure; the final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choice to release the village in increments reconfigures the tutor’s stance and carries felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first image of stalled rain to the final overflow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth, tapestry, and suspended droplets are vivid micro-settings that constrain tactics; the fountain’s eventual overflow directly charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each tug on the tapestry threads; the incremental release method forces a trade-off between instant absolution and ethical pedagogy, with visible price paid in ashes tasted after wrong pulls.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of responsibility versus absolution emerges organically from the tutor’s method; the final image of pigeons still frozen offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—chess notation, L-shaped counts, “knight’s pace”—threads every beat; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor loop risk in “woven hush” repetitions, but each recurrence reweights meaning; no figurative muddle at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village + tapestry-as-chessboard synthesizes familiar motifs into a fresh emotional crucible; the incremental release gambit feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
