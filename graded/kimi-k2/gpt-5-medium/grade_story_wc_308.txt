<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the narrator’s shift from active skimmer to still listener is credibly earned. The arrowhead as inherited tool/prayer crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses the old path. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Slight abstraction in “consent aligned to the old note” keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon folds, distances collapse, and the narrator achieves navigation-by-listening with felt conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via layered echoes and paid off in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The pulse’s refusal to be caged reconfigures the premise on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers and black mirror actively constrain tactics—sound becomes the only viable map. Micro-setting (arrowhead, shale pool) doubles as tool and vessel, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One notch off only because the “centuries of dust” remains more backdrop than clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightened when the pulse evades capture. Escalation occurs via density of echo and bird pattern rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: the surrender of physical motion for acoustic travel. No secondary conflict dilutes focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of listening as displacement—navigation through resonance rather than motion. Subtext carries in the arrowhead’s tremble and the birds’ knotted flight; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without statement. Complexity is embraced: the pulse remains wandering, the listener remains still, yet both are changed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is incantatory, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is unmistakably the skimmer-turned-seer. Patterned repetition (“I do not move… I hold still…”) is taught early and pays off. No dialogue, so no register clash. Minor risk of cadence monotony is offset by rhythmic variation in the bird-flight stanzas.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (bone towers, black mirror) are coherent and grounded. No loops or scaffold; high information density. One near-mixed metaphor—“within arm’s speak”—is purposeful and licensed by the sonic conceit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope (seeker in sacred landscape) is transformed through acoustic cartography and stillness as motion. Synthesis feels inevitable: arrowhead + birds + pulse = map without movement. Risk-taking (renouncing agency to gain it) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>
