<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curator’s interiority is vivid—inventorying stories before objects, leading by following—but the interior contradiction between thrift-store pragmatism and healing ambition is asserted rather than dramatized; the final choice to unlock the mailbox is emotionally resonant yet causally light, making the cost feel more communal than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mailbox opens not by force but by communal listening, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the courtyard from rumor to shared archive; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, each testimony tightening the emotional lock until the hairpin taps the final tumbler.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The courtyard’s hibiscus shadows, bougainvillea, and locked mailbox are tactile anchors that constrain movement and social choreography; the mailbox itself becomes micro-setting, its metal seams guiding the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes—proving listening heals—escalate as developers and cameras press in; the dominant stake tightens when the curator risks social capital by inviting the crew into the hush, but the cost is collective rather than sharply individuated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the shift from locked box to open library; the final image of an unlocked throat for ongoing song offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, letting the communal act of hearing carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded, with a curator’s cataloguing diction (“inventory stories before objects”) and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and the collective “we” remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing atmosphere or action; occasional lyric flourishes (“sandstorm calm”) are earned and pattern-taught, with no loops or scaffold in the closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—mailbox that opens only to communal testimony—is fresh, and the thrift-store curator’s inversion of leadership through listening feels inevitable; the synthesis of rumor, object, and healing is specific and non-obvious.</comment>
