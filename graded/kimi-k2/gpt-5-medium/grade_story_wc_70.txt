<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The toll-keeper’s involuntary candor is embodied in every micro-choice—handing over the matchbox, revealing the tray—yet the interior contradiction between duty and wonder stays vivid. The final admission “I wanted the right listener” crystallizes motive with felt cost. Minor: Mara’s pressure is more functional than crucible, keeping the score just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drones’ reawakening reweights the city’s stance toward wonder, and the keeper’s earlier concealment is justified by the cost of haste. Causal chain holds—riddle solved → box opened → tone restored—without gaps. One hairline slip: the blackout’s timeline is implied rather than anchored early, but the lyric pattern teaches the gap and closure redeems it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s “stormfruit” scent and the lacquer box’s “red-black sheen” are not mere scenery; they constrain access and charge the final image when the queen tone is re-ignited. Spatial choreography is clean—stairs, crown platform, capacitor drums track without drift. A single orienting cue (“after the city-wide blackout”) arrives early enough to waive any debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the hive memory—tightens once: the keeper must decide whether to release the queen tone to Mara. The cost is the risk of irreverent haste; the keeper’s ritual delay embodies that price. Escalation is causal and singular, sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder as civic glue emerges through concrete objects (riddle, box, tone) rather than statement. The final image—drones “finishing interrupted thoughts”—reweights the blackout from loss to renewal without moralizing. Subtext hums in the keeper’s candor as both flaw and gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“nectar dusk,” “hive-warm twilight”—and stays rooted in the keeper’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer coils of reflection contract to the spare admission “I wanted the right listener.” No head-hop; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without clutter. Metaphors are coherent—“slow honey cooling on a spoon” anchors both light and viscosity. One micro-loop: “wonder needs a ritual, even in crisis, perhaps especially then” could trim, but it lands outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of apiarist-code technician with lightning-harvesting spire feels inevitable yet fresh. The riddle-payment economy transforms a familiar quest into a meditation on attention. Risk—the lyric blackout world—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
