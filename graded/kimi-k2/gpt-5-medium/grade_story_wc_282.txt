<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the narrator’s contradictory desire to speak for the unknown yet not own it is dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the fossil to the wall and later leaving it as “resident.” The final renunciation—handing the story over rather than keeping it—carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s promise is logged, the fossil left, the cave’s amber warmth held as “trust earned by exchange.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers sensory data until the final image crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of the leaf and the vow of restraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Coastal cave network is not backdrop but active agent: tide surge forces tactical retreat, limestone exhalations feed the heat map, the throat-shaped hollow literally channels the protagonist. Micro-setting (black pool, mineral hair) constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—becoming an honest voice for the unknown—faces a single decisive tightening: the storm surge tests whether the narrator will cling to the fossil or entrust it to the cave. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the loss of a carried talisman and the burden of accurate translation. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the negotiation between human time and geologic memory; the fossil’s journey from carried pledge to resident contract reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—“the unknown hums under my words, not captive, but partnered”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo in prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is precise (“count them like syllables,” “steady amber, a color I reserve for trust”). Patterned elision (e.g., “heat-mapping emotions”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during surge, longer breaths during plateau. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances map, body, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and coherent (“green vein through gray,” “held vowel”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm mirrors tidal rise and ebb; final line lands clean. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-hibernation oceanic diplomacy via transitional fossils—is fresh yet inevitable. The synthesis of paleobotany, thermal grammar, and ethical restraint feels singular. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if fossil or cave agency is swapped for generic equivalents.</comment>
