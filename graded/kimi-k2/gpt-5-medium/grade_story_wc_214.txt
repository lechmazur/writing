<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the janitor’s micro-choices (polishing the lens, kneeling to listen) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance—polishing marks into guidance—earns its cost through prior attention to the station’s ache. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present choices. Minor: the “spiritually curious” label is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the roof opens, meteors angle away, and the station enters “spared collision” stillness; cost is the shared vulnerability confessed to the sky. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (power failure) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is the station itself—copper-tea smell, humming consoles, ice-salted wind—each detail constrains action or mood. The yellow lantern glass recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Weather and darkness actively pressure the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake: caretaking as existential stance. Escalation is accretive—each meteor teaches which relay is ignored—until the power failure forces a crystallizing choice. Cost is the confession of fear and the spared collision that forecloses escape. Agency remains with the janitor throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from maintenance-as-devotion; no moralizing. The final image of “spared collision” reweights earlier solitude into chosen stewardship. Subtext lives in the station’s remembered boy and the ghosts’ stubborn love. Complexity is honored: vulnerability is strength, yet damage remains legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, slightly archaic—sustained without drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer breaths in calm, clipped fragments during alarms. Perceptual signature is consistent: the janitor notices stardust, copper, fossil pollen. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“fossil pollen,” “shore loves storms”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Occasional elevated diction (“primal elegance”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic janitor + aging station as living organism. Tropes of abandoned observatory and ghost engineers are transformed through tactile maintenance rituals. Risky lyric compression succeeds; final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative echoes.</comment>
