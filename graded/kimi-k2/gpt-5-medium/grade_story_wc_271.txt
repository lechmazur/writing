<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rafi’s contradictory impulses—freeze vs. act—are embodied in real time (gull rescue, photo handling). His micro-choices (naming sensations, folding the photo anew) visibly cost him and reconfigure his stance. Leda serves as pressure rather than ornament. The final Earned Stasis—steady hands holding the folded photo—pays the bill for prior trauma without tidy cure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the folded photograph becomes a trellis-steady talisman. Causal chain: trauma trigger → somatic method → shared rescue → re-weighted photo → earned composure. One clean transition (storm season) is legible. No orientation debt; lighthouse/arboretum anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass roofs, salt wind, and blinking lighthouse constrain every move—tightening glass, timing tides, cueing memory. The photograph and grafting knife act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (Rafi notices sap, not tourist maps). Spatial choreography is flawless across cliff path, greenhouse, caretaker’s room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Rafi convert trauma into sustainable care without denial? Pressure tightens once—helicopter drone triggers freeze, gull rescue forces real-time somatic test, cost is visible tremor and later steady hands. No coincidence resolves; the niece’s logbooks deepen rather than rescue. One meaningful deepening suffices at 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from grafting metaphor: how to splice optimism onto realism so both survive hotter years. Subtext lives in silent acts—folding the photo, matching tide logs to succulents—never in slogans. Final image of unmanned lighthouse + breathing plants offers non-literal answer: automation can guide, but living shelter still needs human tending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-citrus specific: “the ocean said nothing false,” “small promises.” Syntax modulates with stress—long lyrical coils calm, clipped imperatives during freeze. No head-hopping; niece’s dialogue is filtered through Rafi’s ear. Free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich (“retirement”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “scrubbing fog from panes so the citrus could drink the shy sun” does three jobs. Metaphors are precise (gull as “ragged kite”). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—fragments under helicopter drone, longer cadences at moonrise. No register drift; horticultural terms are character-native.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar PTSD-recovery arc is re-seeded through horticultural grafting and an unmanned lighthouse—fresh synthesis. Risk: lyric compression and mosaic shards (storms, logbooks) heighten texture without obscuring causality. Specificity of coastal arboretum and tide-inked logbooks anchors universals. No template echo.</comment>
