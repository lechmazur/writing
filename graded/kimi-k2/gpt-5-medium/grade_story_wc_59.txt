<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his heart a metronome of quaking reverie”), but the prince’s shift from conquest to caretaking is more declared than dramatized; the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the palace’s sway and the mills’ idle reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes choice and consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The suspended palace, cradle, and rose-window aerie constrain every tactical choice; the final feather of light perches on “every helmet, every book, every bolt,” charging the closure image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens through the prince’s escalating acts of assembly; the mills’ slowing is a visible price. One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair versus conquest emerges organically from the prince’s micro-choices; the final image of rust growing petals offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature distinct (“feathered with light the color of old brass polished by tears”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“palace hummed like a hive”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative cadence. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork gothic and ecological myth; the Dawnspoke creature feels inevitable yet non-derivative. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
