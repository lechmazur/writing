<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lida’s contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition vs. insurgent will—are dramatized in every beat: the cane vs. the kite, the oath vs. the vault. Embodied cost (knees to memory, wet-loaf weight) grounds her final choice. Council refusal sharpens her isolation, making the unseal inevitable. Only the council’s generic refusal speech keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: reeds whisper → kite found → code decoded → vault breached → seedling roots. Closure is a Decisive Change: the embryo becomes a living scaffold that forecloses the council’s wait-and-see stance. Cost is legible in the council’s dawn argument and the laughter of children already climbing new stairs. One micro-turn (amber softens) suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Volcanic springs anchor every beat—steam, sulfur wind, mirrored water—constraining Lida’s stealth and later hosting the transformation. Micro-setting (porous rock, wet loaf weight) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: basalt path → schoolyard → vault stairs → pool edge. Only the kite’s sudden appearance feels slightly unmoored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls destiny—tightens when council refusal strips Lida of legal path, forcing covert action. Escalation is causal: each whispered reed, decoded line, and pulse-lock click narrows options until the seedling roots and council arrives too late. Visible price: oath broken, scaffold already grown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: amber relic, kite tail, vine handshake. Final image—children on living stairs—reweights “implanted destiny” into chosen co-creation without moralizing. Reed chorus translating promise into shingles and lullabies is subtext at work. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lida’s plant-tuned perception; perceptual signature is consistent (“mince of syllables slide through cattail”). Syntax flexes with pressure: longer cadence for reflection, clipped fragments during vault breach. No head-hopping; council’s speech is filtered through Lida’s skeptic ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gray water cradled bubbles like secrets” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits insurgent-grandmother intellect. One mixed metaphor—“wet book” for amber—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic botanist grandmother re-engineers destiny via plant-mediated insurgency. Kite-as-cipher and embryo-as-trellis feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final living scaffold. No derivative echoes; voice and world cohere singularly.</comment>
