<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“compass dust on my cheek,” “ribs were lantern slats”), but the apprentice’s decisive turn—solving the hopscotch code—leans on childhood memory rather than a contradiction currently in play, softening the cost of the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the figure-eight flight crystallizes the discovery and releases the light, leaving the ship altered and the town unknowing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (birds, chalk, grid) tightens until the luminous gauze unspools with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Airship, dusk fields, and chalk hopscotch are rendered with selective sensory precision; the hopscotch board on the gondola floor constrains the apprentice’s tactical choice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the drift and turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to chart the next great discovery”—is signaled early and tightened when the apprentice deciphers the chalk code, forcing the helmsman’s trust and the risky figure-eight. Cost is visible: the light escapes, leaving them ordinary again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of language-becoming-motion-becoming-light emerges organically from the apprentice’s acts; the final log entry reframes the entire journey without moralizing. Subtext hums in the “sociable isolation” and the unspoken bargain with the birds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through map-maker curiosity. Syntax modulates with altitude and tension, and the patterned elision (“words… flaring but unable to finish”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers map, bird, and light imagery without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“luminance closed around us like gauze soaked in mint”) stays within the apprentice’s lexicon and heightens wonder rather than overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antique airship, starling murmuration, chalk hopscotch, and polyglot fragment feels inevitable and fresh; no trope remains untransformed. The luminous capture via children’s game is a non-obvious synthesis that deepens on reflection.</comment>
