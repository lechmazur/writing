<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Efan’s “lukewarm” stance—steady, uncertain, non-heroic—drives every micro-choice; the chalked sleeve, reed metronome, and final bell-bridge all spring from this trait. Interiority stays embodied (knees ache, back sings) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is the fisherman, who functions more as chorus than crucible, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s new coordination reweights the world’s rhythm without triumph. Causal chain holds—drip counts → pattern → threads → hum → sea adjustment—each step visible on the page. Cost is felt in Efan’s “uncertain blessings” and the fisherman’s healed-knuckle kiss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The sapphire viaduct, salt-scar, and broken bell form a micro-setting that literally constrains the ritual: stones become bridge, crack becomes metronome. Sensory triangulation (damp-cloth breathing, gull cries, chalk on sleeve) is selective and urgent. Environment evolves with action—no static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance via humble drip-timing—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened through measured drops, reed taps, and final alignment. One meaningful deepening: the realization that only an “echo” can be rebuilt, foreclosing perfect restoration. Cost is the acceptance of partial success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of modest, non-shouting repair emerges from concrete acts: counting drops, tying seaweed, speaking star-names. Final image of the silver ripple offers a non-literal answer—mercy through mathematics—without moralizing. Subtext lives in pauses between gulls and the fisherman’s healed-knuckle kiss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters everything through Efan’s cautious, numerate mind. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under dawn’s deadline, longer breaths during reflection. No head-hopping; fisherman’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“nets mended in winter”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are precise (“single syllables of a language he could learn”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Only hairline slip: “promise failing midword” edges toward poetic excess but fits the bell’s fracture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic repair via humble drip-counting and a cracked bell. Tropes of chosen-one mage and apocalypse are inverted—power lies in uncertainty and partial success. Specificity of chalked sleeve and seaweed threads makes the premise irreplaceable. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
