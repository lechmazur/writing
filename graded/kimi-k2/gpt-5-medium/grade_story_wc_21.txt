<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist’s motive—uncover truth without relief—drives every micro-choice; embodied tension in “breath a metronome” and kelp-ribbon keeps flaw visible. Grandmother’s return is felt cost, not device. Interior contradiction (duty vs ruinous need) stays active in scene. No stock phrasing; voice remains particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of debris-messages intensifies until lagoon mirrors them, triggering retrocognitive descent. Closure is Charged Poise—ledger readable, cost is irreversible exposure of erased names. Causality intact: each shell placement heats diary, summons clerk, unlocks signatures. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and floating zeppelin constrain tactics—debris must be arranged on shore, diary can only be read there. Sensory selection tight: “salt-stiff crate,” “eagle starving over clean beach.” Final image of lagoon as “obsidian vow” recharges setting with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus silence—tightens when clerk delivers stenograph punches; each punch is a lost syllable now reclaimed. Escalation is density increase: debris pattern → diary heat → clerk arrival → signatures. Cost is public exposure of vanished bodies; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from refusal to accept sanitized history; no moralizing. Subtext in clerk’s “salted apology” and grandmother’s water-beaded sash. Final image—lagoon clearing to plain black glass—reweights premise: record itself is the monument. Complexity preserved; no tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “civic songs blister,” “pens hover like gulls.” Compression taught early (“I catalog history to keep it from drowning”) and paid off. POV stable; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “parley, not prayer.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; final cadence crystallizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, zero loops. Figurative language purposeful: “diary glows like a coal” links to later heat. No mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors breath under stress. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively”) justified by archivist voice. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—floating civil-rights archive above burning shore—is non-obvious synthesis. Retrocognitive lagoon as courtroom feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric ellipses pays off: closure legible, stakes heightened. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
