<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—"frugality is a lens" crystallizes motive; the vow encoded in arithmetic shows contradiction between thrift and devotion. Micro-choice to write his name in faint strokes embodies cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Flaw of mockery toward rites complicates the final pledge, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of repair, cipher, and song tightens until the disk’s stillness. Closure is Charged Poise—wires keep singing, cost is perpetual stewardship. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat (tile, wires, water) reweights the stake of quiet faith.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Palace-observatory breathes through tactile detail—bronze pins, cracked drain, soot feathers. The tile and urn function as micro-setting that constrain choice. Final map of winds etches the cost on the wall itself. Sensory hierarchy favors what the astronomer can afford to notice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep the arithmetic alive between regimes. Escalation is textural—each discovery (tile, urn, disk) tightens obligation. Cost is explicit: perpetual oil and hours. No coincidence; every complication is mined from the palace’s bones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from spare means: devotion without spectacle. Subtext in the wires’ hushed chord answers prayer without deity. Final image of regimes changing while the tile survives reframes endurance as sacred. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the dusky harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is austere yet lyrical—"empirically ironic and unashamed" owns the POV’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with lamp-oil breaths and violet silk. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression like "gray feathers" of plaster is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear: "Numbers became corridors" does double duty. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay precise—"pepper and rain" is unexpected yet sensical. Final line’s quiet cadence earns the closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of Babylonian palace, magic square, and frugal astronomy is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk of quiet ending pays off in charged poise. No derivative echoes; the vow encoded in arithmetic feels singular. Transformation test: could not swap tile for any other object without breaking logic.</comment>
