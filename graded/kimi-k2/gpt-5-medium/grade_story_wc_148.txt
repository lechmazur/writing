<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup”), but the final renunciation—choosing silence to steer the current—leans more on lyric assertion than on dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice over the drain and the incoming boat crystallize the stakes without resolving them, reweighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds; the open door and reef-teeth are persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, copper stairs, and salt-locked locks are not backdrop but active pressure: the open door invites entry, the drain beneath the lattice holds unspoken bodies, and the copper roof’s heat steers the final ascent. Environment constrains every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to thread a labyrinth with my own story”—tightens once when the protagonist chooses silence over confession, narrowing options as the boat arrives. Cost is visible: the muffled thing beneath the lattice and the father’s loosened fables.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between inherited lies and self-authored truth; the final image of the lattice over the drain reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is silence complicity or authorship?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is singular, textured, and consistent: “cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son” threads through like a refrain, and the perceptual signature—copperlight, salt, gulls laughing like verdicts—remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in “lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly,” but the cadence supports the lyric mode and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—a prison that faces outward so inmates see what they cannot touch—feels inevitable yet fresh. The lattice, the hush, and the cry-wolf lineage synthesize into a singular vision; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
