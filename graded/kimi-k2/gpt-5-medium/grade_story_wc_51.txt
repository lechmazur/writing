<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“saltshaken hand,” “knees softened”) and motives intensify under pressure; the final micro-choice—accepting fear as duty—earns its cost. Minor drift into lyrical abstraction keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each burden weighed tightens the pattern until the final image reweights love’s cost. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt price—“a vessel asking only to be balanced.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, lamp, and starlight are vivid and selective; the lamp’s dying glow literally buys the path that leads to closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to weigh griefs”—is signaled early; each burden escalates by texture and cost until the final fear is balanced. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is visible in the ledger of bone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love’s unapologetic gravity emerges through concrete particulars; final image reframes prior weights without moralizing. Subtext in the weaver’s silences and the lamp’s guttering carries the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; perceptual signature filters every detail through the narrator’s salt-shaken awe. No head-hop; patterned elision (e.g., “ribs lit by…”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional stacked metaphors (“whalebone reverie,” “lantern of pooled echoes”) flirt with overwriting but never dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: burden-weaving in a bronze grotto under starlight feels inevitable yet wholly new. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—plot fails if names or setting are swapped.</comment>
