<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—“cupped the seed and felt her own nerves sink”—but the final renunciation (locking the annex) is slightly under-cued; the cost is implied rather than dramatized in body or action, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s decision to curate “quiet rigor” over spectacle crystallizes the stakes with felt cost (forfeited profit, landlord risk). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm-born silence → seed → locked door—each image reweighting the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The annex, brook, and storm-rinsed planks are not mere backdrop; they constrain choices (soil in a blacklight pot, cedar-ozone air that “keeps her secret”) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—tightens once: from seed arrival to locked door. The deepening is legible, but the external pressure (landlord, inspectors) remains off-stage, muting the visible price at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship versus spectacle, roots versus noise. The corpse-flower motif reweights from grotesque curiosity to ethical laboratory without a single overt statement; the final bow is an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—“storm-born silence,” “river ticked its patient syllables.” Patterned elision (no direct dialogue) is taught early and paid off in the hush of the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line does at least two jobs. Only minor scaffold—“she thought of city inspectors, investors, and the landlord”—slips into summary, but it is brief and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The escape-room-as-nursery conceit is fresh; orthogonal design, corpse-flower seed, and ledger-that-solves-itself synthesize into a singular artistic stance. Risk is bold yet coherent, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
