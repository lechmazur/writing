<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers worrying the drawer pull, pulse imagined in brass—yet the internal contradiction between recycling mistakes and the clinical detachment required for swaps is only asserted, not dramatized in a single beat. Raglen and Della are sketched through gesture and status, but their micro-choices remain extensions of the narrator’s stance rather than independent crucibles. The final nod and grain sacks show earned change, but the cost is collective, diffusing the personal arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the widening parapet and cooling brass crystallize the fragile détente without declaring victory. Causality is tight—each trade hinges on the drawer pull’s reprise and moon-phase rule—while the withheld names and banners create a felt constraint that persists after the last line. The single-scene frame and clear temporal anchor satisfy scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist-soaked parapet is not backdrop but pressure: slick stone teeth force cautious steps, wind presses bodies closer, and the moon’s clipped coin governs timing. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, its warmth and tarnish anchoring past and present. Spatial choreography is clean—two stairways, two processions, one midpoint ledger—though weather never physically endangers, only moralizes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—untethering people from past mistakes—escalates through each trade; the second snag on a misremembered raid tightens pressure visibly. Agency is the negotiator’s refusal to let calendars or insults dictate terms, forcing both sides to accept moon-synchronized risk. Cost is legible: the boy’s near-death, the waterlogged stores, the lingering possibility of betrayal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the brass object’s journey: treaties once kept, burned, now re-polished by worry. Subtext lives in silences—Raglen’s scar-gnaw, Della’s grip—never in thesis statements. The final image of widening stone and cooling metal reweights “recycling mistakes” as perpetual vigilance, not absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, rhythmic—“furrowed hush,” “clipped coin”—matching the negotiator’s cautious diction. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the mediator’s senses. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Raglen’s grunt-hour, Della’s pragmatic hunger. Compression under pressure is taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers action, object, and memory without scaffold. Metaphors are precise: moon as clipped coin, mist as comb. No loops or synonym churn; occasional alliteration (“furrowed hush,” “slick teeth”) serves cadence, not ornament. Final cooling of brass lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The seed-swap grandmother reframes a familiar war-tale through inherited objects and lunar diplomacy, avoiding genre defaults. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no horns, no victory—yet the charged poise feels earned. Specificity of the drawer pull’s history and the moon-phase rule create freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
