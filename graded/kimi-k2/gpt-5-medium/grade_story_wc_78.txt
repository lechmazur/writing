<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prophet’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tapping fruit, reading clouds, dubbing sea layers—yet the single on-page choice (striking the beam in D) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is implied rather than dramatized. Zaya’s brief appearance adds relational texture but doesn’t force a crucible choice. Overall, a strong, idiosyncratic voice with minor motivational slack at the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each “dub” layers sound into survival architecture, culminating in a Charged Poise—the orchard’s green note after the storm—whose cost is the sustained vigilance and transformed deck. Orientation is taught early through driftwood circle and blue hour; no causality breaks. Closure lands on the page with felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard, xylophone mallet, and bee-swarm ceiling are rendered with tactile specificity; each constrains tactics (spiral lattice placement, tower of crates). Sensory hierarchy narrows under gale pressure. Final image of “clouds rewrite their letters into silence” recharges the setting as both threat and score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—escalates through each dub and tower construction; the gale’s mouth is a coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the transformed deck and the prophet’s exhaustion among pears. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting threat into music emerges organically from every beat; no moralizing. Final silence after storm offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of premise. Subtext in the dubbed names (Bass of Anchors, Sistrum) carries conceptual cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric-prophet voice sustained: “clouds dragged their hems low and hoarse,” “winter lungs,” “foam teaching itself new borders.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm, clipped strikes during gale. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job (image, action, world-rule). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Minor risk of overwriting in “indigo into the brine,” but rhythm justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of orchard-orchestra afloat is fresh, executed with granular specificity. Transformation of raider net into Sistrum exemplifies trope inversion. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
