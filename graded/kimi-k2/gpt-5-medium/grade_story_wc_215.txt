<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recluse is sketched via interiority and embodied ritual; choices like fully opening the box reconfigure his stance and cost him remaining isolation. Micro-decisions (waiting, placing scraps) carry consistent motive and visible price. However, some beats drift into elegant exposition rather than moment-by-moment choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a deliberate reopening of the box that reweights prior silences into an archive; causality loops the covenant to the queen-ghost, sealing witness with heat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds across color intensification and cadence shift. All temporal / spatial anchors are clear within 120 words and never drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The wasteland micro-setting constrains resources (no shade, burnt hives) and its noon-shadow hut directly times the box ritual; specificity locks the final light strike. Sensory filtering via ash swirl and dew-evaporation under stress anchors POV without clutter. A touch more tactile engagement with tool or bee-frame would have lifted higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep unspoken witness safe—intensifies as the queen-ghost demands the archive hold heat; escalation is visible in reopened lid and glowing frame. One decisive midpoint action (hand on warm lid) tightens options with felt burn. Cost is embodied but could have been deeper if prior pesticide guilt were dramatized instead of recalled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: archive as kiln for guilt, silence re-pieced into dawn colors. Subtext resides in gesture—gaze more articulate than speech—and final non-moralizing image of blue stripe. No hollow epiphany; the stained glass pattern teaches and reconfigures meaning without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, precise, and lyrically textured (“mute eloquence,” “snow on cedar boughs”) yet always rooted in concrete imagery. Rhythm adapts: shorter clauses under heat, longer breaths in contemplative beats, no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction slips into abstraction but is rescued by sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances either ritual or atmosphere. Rhythm and synesthetic layering (“burnt-sugar rain scent”) avoid mechanical repetition. Few minor scaffold phrases (“he would” loops) and one mixed metaphor (“kiln of listening”) slightly dilute clarity without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ghost-archive covenant offers fresh synthesis of post-apocalypse, witness, and bee mythology; queen-ghost as burning spared survivor is non-obvious. Specific detail over generic tropes. Risk-taking in lyric closure feels inevitable yet never gimmicky; moderate deduction for familiar orchard-guilt motif that could be any broker.</comment>
