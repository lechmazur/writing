<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—panic “paddles my ribs,” stillness as “a single held note.” Motivation (rescue via scent-math) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to cork the vial and swim back carries visible cost: the temple’s silence is left behind, rescue still uncertain. Minor slip: crew remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory and memory layers tightens until the transmitter thrums. Closure is a Charged Poise—the line sings, rescue possible yet not guaranteed, temple fading “like a star at noon.” Cost is legible in the vial tied to the chest and the fading light. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is vivid and selective: “cathedral of pressure,” “stone teeth scrape my tank.” The temple’s acoustics constrain tactics—sound must nest here—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (perfume vial) also constrains choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crew’s dwindling air—signaled early. Pressure tightens via silt swallowing the lamp, narrowing corridor, and gauge needles. Agency: protagonist’s override of panic and deliberate stillness enable the signal. Cost is felt in the temple’s retreat and the vial’s emptied silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of rescue coaxed from the unholdable emerges through concrete particulars: perfume, hush, memory. No moralizing; final image reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the vial’s “nothing” that still carries bouquet. Complexity lingers—rescue possible, splendor still lonesome.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “the gathered hush sidles close.” Compression taught early (“lonesome splendor”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains strictly interior. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a lone technician-poet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“stone teeth,” “tiny captured moon”). Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses during panic, longer breaths during stillness. Minor elevated diction (“regal pace”) fits the temple’s tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—perfume as rescue signal in a drowned temple—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (lost temple, lone diver) are transformed through scent-memory mechanics. Specificity of the vial and the hush creates a singular vision. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
