<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ada’s grief is embodied through the locket’s tactile presence; her micro-choice to let the therapist hold it crystallizes her arc. The therapist’s interiority remains consistent, though secondary. The final lullaby request shows earned change with visible cost—she will now carry the music alone at night.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by 120 words; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Ada’s stance toward memory shifts without tidy resolution. Causal chain: music links → locket shared → totality communion → lullaby request. Cost is felt in the dark she must now face nightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sage ridge courtyard functions as micro-setting: heat, dust, and tree roots constrain seating and shape communal focus. The locket becomes portable setting, its metal ticking against skin anchoring Ada’s attention. Final image of “notes closer to the ground” reweights the hillside’s long chord.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can ordinary magic ease Ada’s grief? Pressure tightens once—locket offered to communal music during totality. No external antagonist; conflict is internal endurance. Cost: she accepts the lullaby in a lower key, admitting nights remain hard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: wonder as form of love, not rebellion. Subtext in Ada’s finger tracing the “question mark” curl—no answer sought, only continuation. Final image of “guest who knocks lightly” reweights light/dark without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, patient voice mirrors therapist’s adaptive rhythm; sensory selectivity (“thin coolness on the back of my hand”) feels character-bound. No dialogue required; wind and crickets carry subtext. Patterned elision taught early and paid off in hush of totality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet musical; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“moon bit into the sun like a patient moth”) is singular and purposeful. High information density: “ravens wrote cursive” compresses sky, motion, literacy in three words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-healing trope refreshed through micro-gesture: locket placed on guitar body to resonate. Specificity of wheat-colored curl and question-mark shape grounds universals. Risk taken in quiet closure—no grand epiphany, only shared breath.</comment>
