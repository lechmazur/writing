<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s interior contradiction—duty to empire vs. promise to the frost-burned maker—drives every micro-choice; the final act of playing the violin until it melts is earned by prior plant-whispered warnings and coffee-stain prophecy. Embodied emotion (mulberry ache bruising ribs) keeps interiority concrete. Cost is visible: he forfeits payment and safety, walking into sunlight with only damp strings left. Telepathy with plants is more label than lived constraint, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the violin’s dissolution reweights the empire’s claim to dust and propagates music through roots and streets. Causal chain holds—because he listens to plants and stains, therefore he plays, therefore the ice collapses. Cost is on-page: “last drop of the violin on his tongue.” Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The velvet observatory’s heat and humidity are not backdrop but active agents—midsummer presses the dome, melts the instrument, guides the choice. Micro-setting of ferns and coffee stains constrains tactics: plants warn, stains foretell. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true (greenhouse childhood). Final image of breathing leaves charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—tightens once: noon deadline + melting violin force the decisive play. Escalation is causal: heat rises → ice thins → choice narrows. Visible price: loss of artifact, income, institutional favor. No extraneous reversals; single pressure point suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living pollen emerges through action, not statement; the violin’s song seeds the city. Final image of damp strings and breathing leaves offers non-literal answer: archives are silence, roots are chorus. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “the promise already fulfilled.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows”—and stays within Ilya’s perceptual range. Patterned lyricism is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Distinct texture in every clause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent (ticket-stub soul, jam-sweet dream). No loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in “thousand brass coins” but does not dull closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transparent ice violin, plant telepathy, and coffee-stain prophecy synthesize into a fresh constellation; none feel grafted. Transformation test: swap any element and the arc collapses. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors the fantastical in sensory truth.</comment>
