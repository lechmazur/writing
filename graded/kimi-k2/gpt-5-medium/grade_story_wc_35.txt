<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"taste of stored remorse filled my gums with rust." Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. transform) act simultaneously in the kitchen beat. Micro-choice to let the filament lick the palm reconfigures the keeper’s stance, cost visible in his taller but still haunted posture. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory pattern (puddles → coral → broth) tightens toward a Charged Poise. Closure beat—“the fortress exhaled its dream completely”—reweights the premise with felt cost: memory is not erased but rendered bearable. No orientation drift; causality holds under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert-fortress-after-rain is rendered through chef’s biased senses—wet stone, singed cumin, scalloped puddles. Coral pavilion constrains choice: its touch transmits remorse, forcing the cooking decision. Micro-setting (kitchen pots, beetle tracks) functions as tactile arena where memory is transmuted. Final salt rings echo opening puddles, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform remorse without erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: the coral’s touch forces the chef to risk personal contamination. Escalation is textural—each sensory layer increases density until the broth softens the brass scouring. Cost is legible in the keeper’s taller stance and the chef’s aching jaw.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bearing rather than erasing guilt emerges through concrete particulars: coral as archive, broth as balm. Final image of saved coral for “next storm” reweights the premise—remorse is cyclical, not solved. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the beetle tracks and salt rings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is chef’s perceptual signature—taste as memory, puddles as recipes. Syntax modulates with pressure: long lyric sentences collapse into terse kitchen commands. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue minimal but subtextual—“Hands off” carries keeper’s fear. Rhythm accelerates during tasting beat, then exhales with the fortress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image performs double duty—“wet stone and singed cumin” grounds setting and mood. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Line-level specificity—“barley for patience and lime for admission”—compresses motive and method. Final sentence cadence mirrors the exhalation of the dream.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—memory-tasting chef cooks frozen remorse coral—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of familiar grief-therapy trope into culinary alchemy feels organic. Risk in lyric compression pays off: closure image recharges every prior motif. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
