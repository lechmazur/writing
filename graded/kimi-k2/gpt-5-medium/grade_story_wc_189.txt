<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the chronicler’s “sideways seeing” and tactile handling of the cicada reveal layered motives. The final “Yes” is earned by prior reflection and carries visible relational cost. Minor: the partner’s interiority is only implied, limiting crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tide/transition imagery tightens until the pause becomes a Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page—“Yes, I will go inland”—with felt cost (leaving the literal tide). Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, lantern, cicada, and ankle-deep ripple are selective, sensuous, and constrain the final choice. The micro-setting (palm-sized cicada) charges the ending image. A hairline slip: “sky pressed close” is slightly generic amid otherwise precise detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to leave the coast—is signaled early and tightens through textured reflection. The pause itself escalates pressure; the decision forecloses the tidal life with visible relational cost. No reversals, but one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically from cicada, tide, and pause; no explicit moralizing. Final image—“shoreline adjusting to moonlight”—offers resonant, non-literal reweighting. Subtext in silence and gesture is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“catalog reefs,” “starfall like minnows”) is character-bound. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“littorals,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds POV lexicon but remains legible and infrequent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of tidepool science and emotional transition; cicada as molting guide feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure holds coherence. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
