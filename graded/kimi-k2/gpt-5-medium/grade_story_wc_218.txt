<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the caretaker’s contradictory hunger for pattern and respectful company drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—laying the diary beneath the oak—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: the “brazen calm” label is slightly diagnostic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s silence becomes trust, and the caretaker’s death is reweighted as return. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each copper loop and graft tightens the pattern until the final chord. Cost is legible in the thinning breath and the relinquished diary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and causally active: the pillars’ mineral leaves dictate grafts, the copper wires translate tide into pitch. Micro-setting (diary, copper, oak) constrains choices and charges the final image. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The remodel’s rhythm escalates under Accumulative lens; each new relationship (otters, herons, children) narrows the caretaker’s remaining options. Cost is visible in afternoon fatigue and the final relinquishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the caretaker’s embodied labor: reciprocity as architecture. Final image of “returning to the woven map” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in copper song and otter blessing deepens the ecological ethic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature filters every detail through caretaker’s synesthetic ear (“limestone and sap”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under fatigue, longer breaths during dawn work. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Occasional elevated diction (“architectural secrets”) is voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop (“the orchard shifted its breathing” / “the orchard held together”) is minor and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—living stone pillars as co-architects—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of dying caretaker and sanctuary renewal are transformed through mineral botany and interspecies council. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final chord of silence-as-trust.</comment>
