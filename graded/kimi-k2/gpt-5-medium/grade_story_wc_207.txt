<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“compass ticks like a heart that refuses to agree with clocks”), but the father reveal arrives as retrospective summary rather than active contradiction; still, the final renunciation (offering boots and compass) is earned and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the compass’s return reconfigures meaning and forecloses the need for further explanation; causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the father backstory is slightly front-loaded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon and limestone cliffs are not mere backdrop; the wet boards, dripping ceiling, and shifting seams physically constrain movement and catalyze the final offering. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find the place where explanations fail”—tightens through each psychometry reading; the final refusal of explanation crystallizes stance with felt cost. Agency is interior but decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the inadequacy of explanation and the necessity of lived mystery. Final image of the lagoon’s gently moving surface offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and internally coherent; perceptual signature is consistent (“petrichor collector,” “salt library”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor elevation in diction remains within POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of psychometry, post-industrial decay, and subterranean wonder feels fresh; hinged awakenings trope is transformed through tactile specificity. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
