<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s barefoot vulnerability and “awkwardly confident” gait are embodied in every step; her interior contradiction—seeking safety yet courting danger by re-awakening the bay—drives the scene. The micro-choice to close the circuit with her palms crystallizes her hierarchy of values: father’s memory over personal safety. Cost is palpable in the bay’s groan and the siren’s aborted chirp. Only the father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-map projection re-orients the rebellion from rage to navigation. Causal chain holds—deckplate tremor → stone circle → map broadcast—each beat tightening options. The cost is the risk of waking whoever silenced the circuits, made explicit in the text. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay breathes, rust constellations and chalked orbital equations anchor who/where/when within 120 words. The stone circle constrains the final choice—Mara must physically bridge it—and the opera glasses re-weight from relic to proof of alignment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: industrial gloom, mineral hum, cautious lights. Micro-setting (deckplates, nets, chalk) guides every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the Lark—signaled early. Escalation is one tightening: from listening to risking re-activation. Agency is hers; the siren’s dying chirp marks the cost. Pressure coherent under Causal lens; no reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: meaning is the courage to ask the right question and bear the answer’s cost. Subtext in the bay’s “thunderous serenity” and the stones’ grief-hum avoids statement. Final image—map projected onto the hangar mouth—reweights the rebellion without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “constellations of rust like prophecies,” “mineral and memory.” Perceptual signature is Mara’s—barefoot, stargazer, awkwardly confident. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in discovery, clipped beats at closure. No dialogue, so no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—“sleeping leviathan,” “spilled ribbon of routes”—and paid off. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned spaceport, lost parent, ancient tech—are transformed through Mara’s barefoot intimacy and the opera-glass chronology. The stone circle as calibration altar feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in merging grief with navigation tech pays off in the final projection. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
