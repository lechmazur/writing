<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—her need to help versus her fear of vanity—are embodied in the act of freeing the fireflies; the final renunciation carries a visible cost (she loses her “lantern bouquet” and any claim to prophecy). Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“old prickle of embarrassment”). Secondary characters apply pressure, but their voices converge under stress, keeping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mountain’s gentle exhale reconfigures the village’s safety without spectacle, and the cost is felt in Mara’s relinquished agency over coincidence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of light bottles tightens into evacuation choreography. One minor drift: the fisherman’s prophecy line feels like retroactive exposition rather than earned linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Black sand, basalt shelf, and tide line constrain foot placement and bottle spacing; the volcano’s breathing pattern is mirrored in the hush that guides evacuation. Sensory selection is urgent—salt shimmer, gritty shore—filtered through Mara’s bias for texture over spectacle. The jars function as micro-setting objects that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract panic from the village’s marrow—is signaled early and tightened through the bottle-arc ritual. Escalation is textural: density of arrivals and synchronized breathing increase until the sideways plume forecloses panic. Cost is visible in Mara’s surrender of her curated coincidences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation as texture, not spectacle. The final image—bugs ascending as “revised stars”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (bottles left like breadcrumbs) and silence (no named destiny). One soft echo: “philanthropist who gave away coincidence” edges toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—glass chiming, celestial ballet—sustained under pressure. POV remains stable in third-person intimate; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but voice-driven (“mountain was practicing restraint”). Rhythm modulates with hush and shimmer, matching the breathing motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “she gave away coincidence” compresses backstory and motive. Rhythm varies—long breaths of description, then clipped bottle placements. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One minor purple patch: “vibrant hush that promised permission” could lose “promised” without harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster preparedness staged as quiet choreography of light and breath. Tropes—prophecy jars, volcano—are grounded in tactile detail. Risky lyric mode pays off: the final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Slight deduction for familiar “elders nod” beat.</comment>
