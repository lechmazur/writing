<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere”—but the final renunciation of sleep for stewardship feels slightly under-costed; the emotional contradiction is present yet not fully sharpened under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive folds into the car, the clock ticks once, and the train becomes a moving greenhouse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing dune, glass flowers, and lantern spores are selective, tactile, and directly constrain the guard’s planting ritual; the micro-setting of the crate and clock charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating sparks against erasure—tightens through the archive’s game and the single tick of the clock; the cost is visible in the guard’s forfeiture of rest and the train’s transformation, though the escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the guard’s lullaby and the archive’s “not yet”; the final image of a stitched-together morning offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer about stewardship after apocalypse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—“sand blooms pale blue, a million points of cold fire”—and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure; purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional figurative layering—“lantern spores, as soft as lungs, as stern as verdicts”—never muddies causality. One near-loop of “occasionally everywhere” is forgiven for pattern reinforcement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic freight train, quantum archive, and lullaby-as-interface feels inevitable and fresh; the risk of lyric abstraction is fully earned by the grounded stakes and charged closure.</comment>
