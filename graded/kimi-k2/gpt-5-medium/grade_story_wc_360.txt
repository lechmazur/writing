<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory; the narrator’s borrowed personalities and the halo fragment both act as concrete extensions of motive. The final confession—“I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself”—is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The mentor-ghost device risks slight abstraction, but the embodied handling of type and ink keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance toward ambiguity crystallizes with felt cost (“the absence washes my hands cleaner than solvent”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of charged images (halo, ink, stars) reweights the premise without causal reversals. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz workshop, ink smells, and star-maps are selective and purposeful; the halo fragment and press function as micro-setting that constrains choices. Final image of the vanished star on the windowsill recharges earlier motifs and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is tight; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the mathematics of emotion”—is signaled early and tightened through the couple’s commission and the narrator’s self-proof. One meaningful deepening: the narrator’s confession disorients fear and forecloses the safety of borrowed identity. Cost is legible in the cooling halo and the blank star.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of typography and grief; no overt moralizing. Final question—“Will the sky forgive me…”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext in the couple’s silent geometry and the narrator’s confession avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“ink the forme while the night forgets names”) is character-specific. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, charged fragments under the press, longer cadences in reflection. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses letterpress mysticism with emotional arithmetic in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test passes: story collapses without the specific halo-ink transposition. Risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
