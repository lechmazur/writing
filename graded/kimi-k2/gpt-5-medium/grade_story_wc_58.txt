<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulse to “understand the geography of healing” while commodifying grief is dramatized through the act of writing the living obituary. The woman’s presence forces a micro-choice—tying the four names—that visibly alters both their stances. Cost is felt when the thread hums and the quince drop, sealing the change. Minor slip: the man’s interiority is ventriloquized without contradiction, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman’s weeping irrigates rather than breaks, and the thread’s loop around her wrist reconfigures the house as pilgrim trail. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the salt-brass breath and the garden’s stubborn brilliance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The garden’s shadowed autumnal hush constrains the only possible stage; quince, fountain, and ivy door are handled, not catalogued. Micro-setting (thread as measuring line) becomes the tool that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—copper and kelp taste, mothbitten coat. One hairline slip: “wolfshead prow” risks anachronism but is absorbed by lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—naming absence so the woman can sit without a second cup—is signaled early and tightened once when the thread knots foreclose other explanations. Agency is the narrator’s projection across the bridge of presence; cost is the threaded salt-breath and the garden’s recognition. No reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges from concrete acts: tying knots, dropping quince, looping thread. No moralizing; the final image of the garden “spangled with the stubborn brilliance of leaving things” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the woman’s archive eyes and the man’s raw hands carries the emotional freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—“inkstones,” “conch pressed to its own bones.” Patterned elision (projection mechanics) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Dialogue is spare and subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent—“latitude is crueler because it changes nothing around me.” Rhythm breathes with scene needs. One near-mixed metaphor (“inland sea awaiting tide”) but context absorbs it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—obituaries for the living—feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test: could not swap thread for any other object without breaking closure. Specificity of grief-seasonality and palace thread anchors universals. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
