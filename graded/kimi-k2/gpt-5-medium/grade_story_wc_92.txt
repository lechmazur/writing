<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel’s calm inventiveness and maternal inheritance anchor every micro-choice; the final stance—guarding consent—carries visible cost as he forfeits authority. Interiority is embodied (“the corridor tastes of iron and rain”), and contradictory impulses (loyalty vs revolution) act simultaneously. Only a slight drift toward lyrical self-explanation keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fort’s shift from glare to hearthglow is legible and irreversible, with the sentinel’s new post as cost. Causal chain—blackout → coded dial → bronze key → circuit tweak—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis (how Rhun arrives) is forgiven because the blackout itself is the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Twilight fort, blackout, and cradle of sparks are filtered through POV bias; the half-painted sundial and bronze quill constrain choices in-scene. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and taste over sight during darkness, guiding action. The final “lighthouse that agrees to listen” recharges the setting as charged hearth rather than spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—shift the fort from spectacle to hearth—tightens when the blackout enables the act; each beat (quill, dial, circuit) raises the risk of discovery. Agency is decisive: the sentinel chooses heartbeat power over full glare, paying with permanent vigilance. Cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image and action: light as control vs consent, silence as revolution. Subtext in the winking sundial and bronze quill reweights meaning without statement. Final image—“a lighthouse that agrees to listen”—offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to locks, angles, and hush. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments under threat. No head-hopping; Fara and Rhun remain external, filtered through sentinel’s bias. Distinct texture sustains across blackout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. Metaphors (“coals dream under ash”) are coherent and earned. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“ceremonial axis”) is voice-motivated. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lock-picking revolution, blackout as canvas, and hearthglow consent feels inevitable yet fresh. Specific maternal heirloom and coded sundial transform familiar rebellion tropes. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
