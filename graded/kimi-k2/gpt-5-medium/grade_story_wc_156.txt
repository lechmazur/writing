<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the restorer’s contradictory desire for both precision and curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (tapping the coin, loosening soot while guarding story). The final renunciation—accepting imperfection—carries felt cost, though the shift is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-layer tightens the mural’s revelation and the narrator’s stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—certainty loosens, curiosity accepted—paid for by leaving the coin and carrying lighter questions. Cost is legible in the dusk exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The garden’s parabolic dishes and the coin’s ridges act as micro-settings that constrain tactics (sound-guided cleaning) and charge the final image (coin left ringing). Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through the restorer’s professional eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened through each echo-reveal. The mural’s awakening forces the restorer to choose between perfect restoration and living memory; the cost is the acceptance of imperfection, visible in the retained underdrawings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of preservation versus the vitality of ongoing story. The final image of visitors hearing laughter in their own echoes offers a non-literal answer—memory must stay porous—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in tactile craft. Syntax mirrors the methodical-playful stance; perceptual signature is consistent (“precision blooms best when curiosity does not feel caged”). No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“pulses folded like birds wheeling”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction fits the narrator’s artisanal precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—restoring a singing wall via sound—feels fresh and inevitable. The hobo nickel’s transformation from tool to bell to legacy map is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
