<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The keeper’s fractured self and communal weaver role are consistently embodied; her decision to trust the mirror-twin scar sharing lands with visible cost as she “steps back” and relinquishes sole custodianship. Micro-choices (ask the pomegranates, invite quarreling neighbors, lay their names in sequence) expose both flaw and value hierarchy. Interior contradictions (burlap-mettle courage, loose-sewn self) act simultaneously in scene. Final renunciation feels earned in prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gathered lullaby-sigh-chant thickens pattern until the loom-mica catalyzes a Conceptual Repricing—“light tied to dark, both permitted to breathe.” Closure reconfigures the orchard’s night itself rather than abolishing it, with cost legible in “share scars” and the public ledger of names. Orientation is taught by “pomegranate trees…mica window…mirror world” within 120 words and repaid in the final mirrored nod.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, mica window, and loom are not backdrop but active constraints: light must be threaded through flawed glass; roots are swaddled against frost the setting inflicts. Sensory economy—wet stars, sticky laughter—serves urgency without catalog. Night’s negotiation new boundaries reweights setting at closure. One minor slip: “mica window hums along” anthropomorph without set rule, −0.2 inside cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dying realm’s rescue—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure escalates by accretion: every donated song tightens what can still be salvaged. Tightening culmination (“lay their names in sequence”) forces a communal price and forecloses private custodianship. Final light spill is cooperative consequence, not happenstance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bound release emerges from accumulation of ties that free: swaddles, songs, shared scars. Final image reweights earlier “ledger of breath” into living covenant without moral restatement. Subtext resides in gestures (the nod, shared window) rather than explication. Refrain from tidy binary; grief and repair coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric compression taught early—“taste of iron on memory”—and reliably paid off (“names softened to thread”). Perceptual signature remains consistent: narrator notices sap-ferrying seeds, off-hour bell peals. Rhythm modulates with task urgency. Experimental looseness never breaks orientation. One diction stretch—“waxy laughter still sticky”—is purposeful sensory synesthesia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density lines carry dual freight—“bound release again: light tied to dark”—economy without purple. No paraphrase loops; sentence lengths rise and fall on loom rhythm. Minor metaphor strain in “ferry me toward the nursery”; insufficient clarity to obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious syntheses: regret-distilling orchard plus communal dawn-loom reframes apocalypse-recovery myth. Risk in mirror twin split heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of breath-ledger, pomegranate draught songs, beekeepers’ sticky laughter feel unexportable to another frame. Conceptual integrity intact.</comment>
