<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Architect’s interiority is vivid—restlessness under poise, anger under compliance—but the final renunciation (“leave no artifacts, only habits”) feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is implied rather than embodied. Curator’s micro-choice to step beneath the thread is precise and stakes her skepticism, yet her interiority is thinner. Overall, contradictory impulses are dramatized, but the closure’s felt cost is soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each room adds density until the bridge beat crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—bridge held by shared steadiness—cost is the architect’s acceptance that his maps will vanish. Thread’s inheritance and the city’s forgetting frame a persistent constraint. No orientation drift; spatial logic tracks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gallery is not backdrop but active antagonist: walls inhale, floors defect, ladders argue. Micro-setting (dust, eye-nail, vent snow) constrains tactics—dust tied into thread becomes the bridge’s mortar. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; unsettling calm pervades without cliché. Final image of morning on glass recharges the gallery’s mutability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—tightens when visitor’s laughter softens and the bridge holds. Escalation is textural: each room increases perceptual instability until the trio’s triangle stabilizes it. Cost is the architect’s relinquishment of permanence. Agency is architect’s, but escalation could be sharper if the anger beat had bled into tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection as fragile, temporary architecture emerges through concrete acts—thread, dust, bridge—never stated. Final image reweights the premise: trust is not in the bridge but in the staying. Subtext in curator’s written doubt and the visitor’s unseen smile carries resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is architect’s—“measuring a room without stable edges.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under anger, longer coils during weaving. No head-hopping; curator’s interiority is filtered through architect’s noticing. Dialogue sparse, subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off—“rational enchantment,” “volcano under water singing compliance.” No loops or scaffold; each image advances stakes. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor register drift in “ethically provable” is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of “fever dream architect” mapping thresholds via inherited living thread is fresh; gallery as sentient perceptual engine deepens it. Risky lyric compression taught early and held. Transformation test: story collapses without thread and gallery’s active complicity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
