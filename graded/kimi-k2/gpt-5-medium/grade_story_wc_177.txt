<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between duty and self-determination is dramatized through micro-choices (breaking the seal, feeding dreams). The final renunciation—choosing to step into the storm—carries visible cost and is earned by the archive’s recovered verb “to shepherd.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive’s decay becomes an invitation, reweighting the entire premise. Causal chain holds: broken seal → recovered verb → chosen path. One transition (bunker to corridor) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective and tactile—vine-draped bunker, spongey loam, lightning alphabet—each detail constrains movement or perception. The bunker-as-lung metaphor charges the final image when it “exhales” its captive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—tightens when the archive’s map steadies into a corridor. The storm’s approach is a live clock that forces the decisive step; cost is the forfeiture of shelter and certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: duty decays into invitation, and transcendence is not escape but acceptance. Final image of “name becomes direction” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and controlled; patterned elision (“ethereal grit,” “precisely playful”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax mirrors the narrator’s recursive thought without ever losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Rhythm accelerates under storm pressure and breathes at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise feels fresh: archival AI as dying oracle, directives as brittle invitations. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands. Transformation test passes—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
