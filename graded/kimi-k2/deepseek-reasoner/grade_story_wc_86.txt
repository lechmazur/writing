<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her thumb on the brass pull, her refusal to step between the spitting boy and the commander—yet her “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The drawer-pull micro-choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values and visibly costs the commander his retaliatory impulse, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the commander’s nod reweights the scene’s stakes without violence, and the drawer-pull’s reprise charges the final image. Causal chain (moon phase → pause → object hand-off) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and swirling mist are not postcard backdrops; the wind literally snaps coats and swallows voices, forcing the ritual pause. The drawer-pull functions as micro-setting that constrains the commander’s choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent massacre at the exchange—tightens when the boy spits and the commander’s hand moves to weapon. Escalation is one decisive beat, but the cost (potential second boy’s death) is visceral and the commander’s renunciation is earned on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges through the drawer-pull’s journey from child’s dresser to battlefield talisman; no moralizing, only charged image. Final moonlit silence reweights prior hostility without tidy forgiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is tactile and weather-battered. Syntax modulates with wind-gust fragments; no head-hop or register drift. Dialogue sparse but subtextual—commander’s bark vs Elara’s calm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured—“furrowed hush,” “mist into swirling ghosts”—with rhythmic variation that breathes with gusts. No loops, no mixed metaphors; every sentence advances image or tension. One near-cliché (“knife’s edge”) forgiven under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar prisoner-exchange frame is transformed by the moon-phase ritual and the domestic drawer-pull as peace talisman. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk lies in quiet lyric refusal of shoot-out payoff. No derivative echoes.</comment>
