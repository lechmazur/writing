<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arden’s longing for the impossible is viscerally embodied (fluid grace vs claustrophobic prison), but the “releasing of name and history” beats get summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, blurring the felt cost on the page. The contradictory impulses—yearning vs surrender—are named more than shown colliding at the moment of unspooling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Arden becomes “current and song” and the island “begins to fade,” both legible before/after states with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain (scrimbshaw ⇒ whale-song ⇒ surrender) stays intact under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor drift: island’s “guarded heart” is introduced very late, yet its final flare locks meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe, black-scand beaches, crystalline heart and moonlight skin create a tactile lattice that literally constricts action—the cliffs only part after bone-held heat is offered. Locale is used, not toured; the whale’s body-scaled geography functions as setting that enables the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>A single, coherent stake—freedom at any existential cost—is signaled early and intensifies through the harmonic whale-call that literally vibrates the boat hull. The tightening is unmistakable: to reach the island Arden must shed former identity, a choice that forecloses return. One off-stage convenience: how the skiff is provisioned for days is elided.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Freedom vs enforced tranquility emerges organically from action (smuggling a self under a ceasefire). Combative tenderness is embodied when release becomes a fierce embrace. Final image of moonlight-colored whale answers the thematic question wordlessly, avoiding any moralizing statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>The lyric third-person stays close to Arden’s perceptual signature: “ghost of a memory,” “hesitation.” Syntax modulates with stakes—long, wave-like clauses calm into staccato as the island answers. Occasional elevated phrasing (“profound song resonated”) momentarily lifts above a dock-work lexicon, but self-corrects quickly.</comment>

<comment>Prose is spare yet vivid, no loops or fluff; phrases like “the sea a vast, empty mirror” earn their metaphor. No mechanical repetition clogs the arc. Tight information density allows the final beat to land clean.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The transformation of ceasefire-borne restlessness into cetacean selfhood feels inevitable rather than gimmick. While the disappearing-island trope is familiar, the specificity—“the island manifested when called by a kindred soul”—and biological metaphor for personal freedom lift it above template. No famous echo undercuts surprise.</question>
