<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt its weight, its history”), but the story never forces him to act against his core motive; the final smile is too frictionless. No contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page, so the “earned” change feels asserted rather than suffered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the stone-ripple motif returns in the lighthouse lens, creating a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise (“the prism atrium exploded with light”), but the cost is only conceptual—no forfeiture or new constraint is made palpable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pearl Bay’s dawn mist and the prism atrium are rendered with selective, purposeful detail; the glass lens physically refracts the earlier water rings, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the jetty-to-workshop transition is compressed rather than staged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming mundane glass into life-saving light—is signaled early and deepened through the lens commission. However, pressure escalates only interpretively; no concrete obstacle or trade-off narrows Elian’s options, so the “tightening” is more lyrical than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the value latent in the ordinary is revealed through light and reflection. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, but the insight remains slightly abstract because no personal cost is dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“reading between the lines of light and current”) is sustained. Compression and patterned diction serve the accumulative design; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is disciplined, never obscuring clarity. Minor scaffold (“soft grays and silvers”) but no loops or artifacts near closure. High information density advances atmosphere and theme simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier craft and philosophical reflection; the stone-ripple-to-lens-beam conceit feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but specificity of harbor glasswork elevates familiar material.</comment>
