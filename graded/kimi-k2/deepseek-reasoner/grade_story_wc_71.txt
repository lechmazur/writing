<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—detached scholar vs. compelled caretaker emerges late but is embodied by her fingers touching the silence-stone. Motivation turns from curiosity to self-offering, but her flaws stay abstract; no moment where the choice stings. Passes micro-choice test but misses stronger cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each found object layers the bay house's memory palimpsest. Closure is a Charged Poise—“Elara added her own voice”—with conceptual cost (she can never again be only observer). One small beat of lens wavering when vision merges memory with present; otherwise coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Attic “dense watchful quiet,” salt-tinged air, and the streetlight bleed are tactile, precise, and integrated into the ritual handling of objects. The bay itself stays backdrop but each object’s placement alters spatial intimacy, constraining final placement of Elara’s new stone. Near 9+ but environment itself doesn’t tighten tactics—objects do.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the house consume or partner? Escalates through accumulation of charged keepsakes rather than conventional stakes reversal. Pressure tightens when Elara’s own stone joins the array—irrevocably lodging her within the house’s memory. Could be sharper if she risks more tangible loss; cost is mostly conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—“a house feels alive because it is loved”—grows organically from sensuous particulars: scent, silence, the woman’s grinding ritual. Final scene reframes silence from predatory to companionable with quiet, resonant image of shared spring. No thesis statements; every image reconfigures earlier meaning. Fresh, unclichéd emergence.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited retains intimate psychic distance; lyrical compression is taught early (“orange glow of the streetlights daydreaming”) and paid off in closing cadence. Vocabulary and syntax modulate with emotional tempo; no head-hopping. Rare slips into heightened abstraction (“hushed blaze of devotion”) but pattern remains coherent.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pulse—long lilts during contemplation, clipped fragments when silence vanishes. Occasional loop of “hushed” and “quiet” but spaced enough to avoid dulling. No false poetry; figuratives serve perception not ornament. High density: every line doubles as sensory texture and lore deposit.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection is the literalized “shard of hush”—silence as tactile relic. Avoids haunted-house cliché by reframing haunting as an act of patient love. Woman’s archive of small, ordinary objects becomes supernatural without any magic except devotion. Risk pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
