<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking death yet clinging to perception—drives every beat; the parasol tip anchors her micro-choice to release rather than hoard. The old woman’s calm crystallizes Elara’s shift from voyeur to participant. Cost is felt when she opens her hand and the ivory vanishes. Minor slip: “euthanasia tourist” is label-speak that never re-enters her embodied voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the final release reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the open hand reconfigures her stance with visible forfeiture. Causality is lyric, not linear, yet the drift-ice cadence teaches the pattern early and pays off in the last image. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure: creaking dock, frost-slick wood, moonlit collisions dictate stance and tempo. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices what thins her membrane, ignores tourist detail. One hairline slip: “distant snow and salt” is generic filler amid otherwise razor-sharp selection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens through textured accumulation rather than causal reversals. The old woman’s anecdote delivers the decisive deepening: the sound is release, not loss. Agency is renunciation; the open hand forecloses the trawling quest with felt cost. Pressure plateaus lyrically rather than spikes, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: endings are internal relinquishment, not external events. The parasol’s flight reprises the old woman’s story, reweighting it from elegy to benediction. No moralizing—just the indifferent music of ice and wind. Final image crystallizes the thematic question without a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, glacial, yet warm-blooded in its attention to texture. Perceptual signature—“thin veneer over a vast, humming silence”—threads every observation. Syntax breathes with the slow heave of ice; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-rich: “It caught the wind” carries entire cosmologies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and propulsive despite lyric stillness. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Each sentence does at least two jobs: “The ice groaned, a low, tectonic sigh that was the marina’s native tongue” grounds setting, stakes, and voice in one stroke. Final paragraph is flawless cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—“euthanasia tourist” seeking spiritual quietus via disaster relief—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully inhabited. Transformation test: swap ice for desert and the story collapses; specificity is integral. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure without gimmickry. Minor deduction for faint echo of “thin membrane” trope.</comment>
