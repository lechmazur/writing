<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied in copper filigree and precise micro-choices; the contradiction between preservation and the diamond’s curse is dramatized in scene. The final acceptance of dissonance feels earned, with visible cost in the transformed diamond and her exhausted departure. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” is asserted more than shown in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo layer intensifies texture until the final cadence shift reweights silence itself. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the diamond’s warm stillness and the canyon’s new “full silence” crystallize stakes with felt cost. No causality breaks; orientation is anchored early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-canyon is not backdrop but acoustic crucible: its spires dictate method, constrain tactics, and absorb the final symphony. Micro-setting of the diamond’s fracture likewise guides choice. One hairline slip: “endless” used twice in adjacent clauses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve language before extinction—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each echo. The diamond’s curse escalates stakes from distortion to potential annihilation; Elara’s pivot to weave dissonance narrows options and exacts psychic cost. Agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory must include pain to remain true. Subtext lives in the diamond’s shift from malice to vessel, in the silence that becomes “full.” Final image reweights all prior echoes without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, matching Elara’s quiet precision; perceptual signature filters every detail through sonic texture. No head-hopping; compression is taught early (“tunnel of echoes”) and paid off. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction momentarily intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor mixed metaphor—“frozen lightning bolt” beside “caught starlight”—but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: petrified bone canyon as acoustic archive, diamond as cursed recording device, bird-flight as cipher. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; concept commits fully.</comment>
