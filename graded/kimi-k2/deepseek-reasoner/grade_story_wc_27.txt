<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot stance and opera-glass ritual embody her obsessive search for pattern; the hum crystallizes her awkward confidence into decisive witness. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and drives the final choice to summon the cell. The cost—abandoning her private stargazing to become public catalyst—is legible but not yet viscerally paid, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lull thickens until the stones’ hum reweights the rebellion’s meaning. Orientation is swift; the decisive change (living tapestry projected overhead) lands on the page with conceptual cost—the rebels’ grief reframed as cosmic stewardship. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay’s oil-stained permacrete, skeletal cranes, and moss-covered monoliths are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s barefoot sensitivity. The setting constrains movement and supplies the stone circle that powers the climax. Micro-setting (bare feet, opera glasses) doubles as tactile anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rekindle stalled rebellion. Pressure tightens when the hum forces Elara from passive stargazer to active witness; the tapestry vision narrows options to awe-driven resolve. Cost is conceptual—loss of anonymity and private meaning—made legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cosmic perspective reframes local struggle without moralizing. The “meaning in the mess” is dramatized through the tapestry, not stated. Final image of blazing stars above silent rebels offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is lyrical yet grounded (“cool, oil-stained permacrete”). Rhythm modulates with the hum’s crescendo. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture—distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language (“cathedral to a dream of the stars”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“cosmic perspective”) fits Elara’s stargazer lens. Final tapestry description avoids purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of barefoot stargazer, vintage opera glasses, and ancient stone circle feels fresh and inevitable. The rebellion’s reignition via cosmic witness rather than violence subverts genre default. Specificity of moss-covered monoliths in a derelict spaceport creates memorable texture.</comment>
