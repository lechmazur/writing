<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary candor is embodied in the throat-tightening compulsion and the “tasting like ash” line; her micro-choice to open the box under pressure crystallizes her value hierarchy. The technician remains a functional sounding board rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Interior contradiction is present but resolves a touch too smoothly into cooperative awe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → hive failure → riddle → realignment → restored power. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the tower’s re-tuned crown now bears the literal scar of lightning. Orientation is anchored by nectar dusk and tower perch within 120 words. One minor causality wobble: the technician’s instant riddle-to-diagnosis leap feels slightly gift-wrapped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower’s stone, gears, and lightning rods are tactile and constraining; the lacquer box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—hum, flash, velvet—filtered through Elara’s anxious attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment guides choice: the rods literally redirect the lightning that saves the hive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city starvation via hive failure—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: blackout → misaligned array discovered → realignment. Agency is Elara’s reveal of the riddle, which forces the technician’s tactical shift; cost is the tower’s newly scarred crown and the irreversible exposure of her secret. Coincidence is limited to the riddle’s perfect fit, but it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved through routine emerges organically from Elara’s hoarded secret and the tower’s rekindled hum. Subtext lives in the matchbox’s transformation from private talisman to public salvation. Final image of “newborn stars” reweights the premise without moralizing. One soft echo: “I just kept the wonder” edges toward articulating the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—“bruised amber,” “sad metal heart.” Syntax modulates with stress: short bursts during the reveal, longer cadences in reflection. Dialogue is spare but distinct; technician’s register is flatter, Elara’s involuntary candor leaks through. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; “nectar dusk,” “sad metal heart,” and “newborn stars” are precise without purple overload. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—accelerated during realignment, softer at closure. One minor loop: “wonder” is repeated in close proximity near the end. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bee-hive collapse, lightning harvest, and involuntary candor feels fresh; the riddle-as-diagnosis is an elegant, non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of the lacquer box and nectar dusk anchors the world. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than spectacle—but coherence never wavers. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
