<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory motives—quieting Kael’s doubt while secretly seeding nuance—are dramatized in her micro-choice to hand over the shard. Kael’s shift from armored certainty to raw astonishment is embodied, not labeled. The cost (loss of the “clear conscience” he paid for) is visible in his steady hand and quiet “I’ll find another way.” Only the brief “ghostwriter for morality” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance crystallizes into nuanced acceptance, cost paid by forfeiting the ruinous deal. Causal chain holds—each chime interpretation tightens pressure until the shard forces the decisive reweighting. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the campfire’s “faint hiss” is heard again in the shard, a mild echo rather than a taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s wind chimes and salt air are not backdrop but instruments that constrain Elara’s method and Kael’s hearing. The hollow shard’s cold weight against her thigh functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory filtering (predawn chill, first sun ray) mirrors internal stakes. Only the cliff path remains a generic sketch, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kael’s need to silence doubt—tightens when each chime interpretation strips his armor. One clear escalation beat: the shard’s mosaic forces a trade-off between profit and friendship. Cost is felt in Kael’s whispered memory and renounced plan. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; no coincidence resolves it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the chimes’ tonal clashes and the shard’s fractured reflections: certainty is a self-inflicted wound. Subtext lives in Kael’s rigid posture and Elara’s pocketed shard. Final image of fertile vulnerability offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s selective noticing; perceptual signature is sharp (“cold weight,” “chaotic, melodic conversation”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during shard reveal. Dialogue carries subtext: Kael’s “You’re late” is polished armor. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. “Sincerely insincere courtesy” is precise; “fertile ground where better choices could finally grow” lands as earned culmination. One minor filter verb cluster (“she saw Kael flinch”) is swiftly redeemed by embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “conscience for hire” premise is transformed through the wind-chime oracle and hollow shard, avoiding moral-fable cliché. Specificity of abalone-copper trust and driftwood-iron promise anchors freshness. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
