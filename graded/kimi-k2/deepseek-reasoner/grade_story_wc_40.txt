<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s introversion is physicalized through embodied silence and micro-choice; her renunciation of secrecy at climax is earned by prior isolation and cost. Interior contradiction (hope vs despair) is simultaneous, not alternated, shown through her tremor at the crystal’s response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: whisper→echo→revelation tightens because/therefore linkages. Closure image (new word born) is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—with felt communal cost on page. No orientation debt; tempo tracked precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The suspended hush is environment-ear; soundless dust motes and skeletal chandelier generate pressure. The crystal’s whispers mirror the “hush,” then reweight it as pregnant potential. Micro-setting (body-crystal) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: resurrection of language. Escalation via escalating phoneme failures culminating in Spiral realization narrows choice to testify. Cost: breaking own vow of silence before the council—mid-scene, seen.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: spiral growth as return-to-root produces novelty; never stated. Final note reweights “innocence” from lost to renewable via enduring cost. Subtext sung, not claimed.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—attention to dust and ink—kept under lyrical pressure. Rhythm matches hush; syntax fragments at emotional peaks, compressed diction at reveal. No head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Highly propulsive; no loops or filler. Sentence variety supports breath/resonance shifts. Occasional elevated diction (“pregnant hush”) reads intentional, not register drift. Final image crystallizes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dead language resurrected via acoustic feedback is unpredictable yet inevitable. Ending image of communal choral babble unprecedented, charged with emotional and conceptual cost.</comment>
