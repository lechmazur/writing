<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and melancholy are embodied in her micro-choices—tweezering the grain, enduring the cold, re-mapping the glyph against stars—so her final endurance feels earned. The interior contradiction between duty and reverence is present but lightly sketched; more contradiction under pressure would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hologram’s memory reweights the summit from barren to once-alive, paid for by Elara’s stamina and the miners’ imminent erasure. Causal chain (grain→glyph→alignment→memory) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the spiral star-map is taught early enough to avoid orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit’s vacuum silence, plummeting cold, and basalt stone constrain Elara’s endurance and camera use; the grain itself becomes micro-setting that triggers the climax. Sensory selection is filtered through her professional priorities—dust, star patterns, heater whine—without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness before obliteration—tightens as the countdown slows and cold bites. One meaningful deepening: recognizing the spiral as star-map turns passive waiting into active alignment. Cost is visible exhaustion and the irreversible vanishing of the grain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence emerges from the juxtaposition of corporate erasure and ancient memorial; the final image of a lost world under a younger sun reframes the summit’s silence as elegy. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the photograph Elara now carries for two vanished species.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, scientific, yet lyric when describing “diamond-hard stars” and “ghost of a lost world.” Perceptual signature—geologist’s precision mixed with quiet awe—remains consistent. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within her lexicon and knowledge bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance stakes or atmosphere without scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“lunacy,” “elegy”) fits the reflective mode. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a single engineered grain as millennial alarm clock, linking vanished civilization to lone witness. Tropes of “last photograph” and “ancient message” are transformed through geological specificity and cosmic alignment. Risky compression at 600–800 words pays off.</comment>
