<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s longing is embodied in her chest and in the salt air; the palette is handled, the light-gathering ritual is dramatized. Her final instinctive act—throwing the sunrise at the lens—grows credibly from prior frustration and the cipher’s pull. The cost is the empty palette and the hushed, answered ache. Interior contradiction (record vs. transform) is present but could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds: inciting whisper, failed attempts, decisive throw, living projection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the dream becomes world, the ache is answered, the palette is void. Causal chain is tight under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sunrise capture accumulates until the throw reconfigures reality. Cost is legible in the emptied palette and silenced whispers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stone lighthouse, salt air, western rampart, dead lens—each detail is filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias and later repurposed. The palette and beacon glass act as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis: frantic oranges and purples, then hush. No orientation drift; geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—tightens when the smallest isle’s cry shifts from sigh to scream. One meaningful escalation: she stops pressing light to paper and hurls it at the beacon, trading static beauty for living transformation. Cost is the emptied palette and the cessation of whispers. Agency drives the turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of longing as creative force emerges from concrete acts: failed light-paintings, vitalizing beam, islands granted their wishes. No moralizing; the final silence and empty palette reweight the premise without statement. Subtext lives in the palette’s transformation from recorder to key. Complexity is honored—longing remains, but is answered rather than erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “nascent colors onto her palette,” “living, swirling projection.” Syntax modulates with urgency—frantic gathering, breathless watching. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara’s selective perception. Compression and patterned elision (“hush of improbable beginnings”) are taught early and paid off in the final silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world rule. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during the frantic capture, then exhales into the hush. Minor elevated diction (“cipher of longing”) is earned by context and voice consistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian of ghosts, painting with dawn, cipher of longing as source code. Tropes are inverted—the lighthouse beacon becomes a projector of dreams rather than a warning. Specificity grounds the fantastical: hardened paint wells, barnacled mast crowned with phosphorescence. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
