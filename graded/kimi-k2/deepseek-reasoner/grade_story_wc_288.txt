<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between shielding isolation and the ache of loneliness is dramatized in her daily tracing of the sundial. The final micro-choice—hand on brass—earns the shift from archivist to navigator, with the cost of forever leaving the only home she knows. One slip: “contemporary of a species extinct for ten millennia” is summary, not felt contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: the library begins to turn, propelled by tidal rhythm and hum, reconfiguring Lyra’s entire purpose. Causal chain holds—light focus → hum → glyphs → map → launch—each beat tightening options. Cost is palpable: she forfeits stasis with ghosts for uncertain voyage. Minor ellipsis in how the hum frequency is learned, but pattern is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal library is not backdrop; its breathing corridors and atomically reflective walls actively channel light onto the sundial, enabling the final ignition. Micro-setting (brass warming under focused photons) constrains the decisive beat. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One anachronistic flicker—“atomically reflective” feels like physics lecture, not lived perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—escalates from shield to cage to launch. One clear tightening: realization that the library is a vessel, not tomb, forces the irreversible choice. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (tide timing) but does not resolve. Cost is the forfeiture of familiar sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-knowledge emerges organically: extinct voices will seed new worlds. Subtext lives in the sundial’s uselessness becoming usefulness—time reclaimed as navigation. Final image of turning library offers resonant, non-moral answer. One soft echo: “translate isolation into independence” edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, slightly archaic—sustained across every sentence. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Lyra’s alien sensorium (“scales the color of tarnished moonlight”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long languid clauses in stasis, clipped fragments at ignition. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors are precise—“weight of forgotten stories” is felt mass. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“liquid river of sun”—momentarily blurs viscosity and light, but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses extinct archivist, floating library, and tidal propulsion into a fresh synthesis. Sundial-as-key reverses expectation without gimmickry. Emotional specificity—grief repurposed into launch—grounds the wonder. Risky structure (quiet epiphany rather than battle) pays off through earned resonance.</comment>
