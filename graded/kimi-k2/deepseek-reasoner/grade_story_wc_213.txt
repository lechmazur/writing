<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to warn vs. reverence for listening—is embodied in her micro-choices (knotting rope, then releasing it). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits institutional safety and accepts personal blame, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: broken lever → rope repair → glue-drying wait → hymn interruption → refusal to pull. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: “the rope hung still, a silent testament to a choice well made.” No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The windblown sanctuary, brass horn, and hemp rope are tactile constraints that shape every beat; the rope’s final stillness charges the closure image. Microclimate details (pressure drop, ozone scent) are filtered through Elara’s professional bias, grounding stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sound alarm vs. preserve fragile peace—tightens once when the valley hymn reframes the cost of noise. Agency drives escalation: her refusal narrows options and accepts personal risk. Cost is legible in the towns’ self-reliant response.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as active stewardship versus noise as control. The hymn’s fragility versus the siren’s violence reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of calm preparation below clouds offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is precise (knot tension, ozone scent). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during repair, longer lyrical cadence during hymn. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “frayed end… coiled like a sleeping serpent” does double duty as image and foreshadowing. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances choice or atmosphere. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-warning siren repurposed as meditation on silence. The rope’s transformation from tool to unused relic feels inevitable. Risky refusal of genre expectation (no blaring climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
