<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><<comment>>Sir Alistair’s interior arc from passive observer to active agent of possibility is foregrounded through micro-choices—shiver, breath fog, trembling fingers—that embody emotional stakes. His silence is never ornamental; it forecloses the “old knight” script to earn the new story.</comment>>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><<comment>>Causal chain holds: reliquary program → puppet → unsnapping → blank page. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the luminous knight as “idea” reweights the premise with exact cost at the ending beat.</comment>>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><<comment>>Alchemical glass cathedral pressures spatial choices (white-stone path, Kas gene splice vines), the greenhouse breathes with the scene, and frost-dew glow charges the final luminous knight. Consistent, particular, not tourist catalog.</comment>>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><<comment>>Single dominant stake: glimpse future shape before it hardens. Pressure escalates because each loosened thread narrows options until the orchard exhales to stillness; closure choice is protagonist’s unsnapping that forges blank slate.</comment>>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><<comment>>Theme emerges from particulars: possibility vs predetermination. The final image—hovering, glowing knight as code—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><<comment>>Distinct lyric compression—murmured allegiance, shivering bliss, crystalline chime—maintains perceptual signature under pressure without head-hopping. Pattern-teaching payoff at end lands clear.</comment>>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><<comment>>Rhythm and metaphor serve moment: precise “solidified light” vs “shivering bliss,” no purple overload. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with each unsnapping, then hushes for final glow. One looped phrase keeps from 8.0.</comment>>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><<comment>>Fresh angle on mythic knight: puppet theater program recast as ritual script. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable: freeing the miniature knight = freeing self. Points for risk without gimmickry.</comment>>
