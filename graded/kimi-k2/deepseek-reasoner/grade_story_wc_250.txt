<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motives are legible and consistent; his “teach darkness the value of stars” is dramatized through the mirror and shutter lessons. Elian’s arc from mute fear to active weaving is embodied and earned, with trembling hands and aching arms as cost. The mentor-student status shift is staged through gesture and rope transfer, not exposition. One minor slip: “spiralingly calm” is repeated without fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian’s final pattern gifts the canal a “borrowed constellation,” reweighting both boy and darkness. Causal chain—mirror lesson → shutter practice → Elian’s own pattern—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cobalt dock…after the afternoon rain”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural patterning taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dock’s wet planks, signal tower shutters, and reflected starlight constrain every move; the dental mirror even functions as micro-setting. Sensory triangulation (wet stone, creaking ropes, star-glint) is selective and POV-filtered. One missed beat: tower interior layout remains vague, but it never affects choice. Final image of “dry planks” and “clear sky” recharges earlier rain motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elian must learn to speak without voice—tightens when Kael hands him the ropes. Escalation is Accumulative: each shutter pull increases the canal’s light until the boy’s own pattern forecloses silence. Cost is visible in aching arms and the nod that seals the gift. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through concrete acts: mirror-caught star, shutter-woven light. No moralizing; the canal’s glittering answer is the non-literal thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s nod, Elian’s trembling pull. Final image reweights silence from cage to canvas without a word of summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perception; Kael’s interior is shown only through observable gesture. Syntax mirrors emotional cadence: longer lyrical lines for awe, clipped fragments under effort. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. “Spiralingly calm” is the lone repeated tic, but it is taught early and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “inky water,” “greedy mouth of shadows,” “seismic approval.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Rhythm breathes with action—short pulls during weaving, expansive clauses under starlight. One mixed metaphor (“mountain of support”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar mentor-pupil arc is re-angled through non-verbal semaphore and starlight pedagogy. The dental mirror as teaching tool and the shutter-code as language feel inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of canal, fever-stolen voice, and cobalt planks anchors universals. Risky quiet ending lands with earned resonance.</comment>
