<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s single-minded motive anchors every action; her interior contradiction (grief vs wonder) is embodied, and the final acceptance of sorrow is earned with visible cost—the fossil’s quiet settling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is precise: the fossil’s rotation yields a single, resonant note that reconfigures Elara’s entire purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cumulative emotional density charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cave sounds taste of salt; the grotto’s air resonates with crimson pressure. The fossil and its glow function as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grief given voice—is escalated by the fossil’s crimson surge and tightened by Elara’s resolve to carry the leaf’s lament. Agency drives the final act of translation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from singular detail: “world’s own grief” is textually weaponized into music. The ending reweights the premise—Elara becomes the voice—without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person sensory filter is consistent; ellipsis and patterned compression taught early via “salt and ancient stone.” Instrument hum in low notes mirrors perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is cinematic—alternating short bursts with lingering sensory strings. No ornamental loops; every sentence advances toward the final, aching note.</comment>

<comment>The fossil-as-voice angle is fresh; entropy made audible feels inevitable. Risk-taking lies in sustaining lyric stillness under mounting cost without gimmickry.</comment>
