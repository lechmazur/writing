<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear, embodied stakes; the inner-ear tilt and absolute silence create a visceral, character-specific lens. The contradiction between hearing nothing and believing in a “song” is active through every page choice, not summarized. A meaningful renunciation/renaming of silence happens under pressure. Motivation never wavers, only intensifies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (wave / silence inversion). Escalation is a density increase: temperature hues shift and stakes accumulate toward the seam of glass and flower. Closure is the CR—re-pricing “silence” from absence to felt harmonic—delivered in a single crystallizing image with visible cost (hand-numbing cold, hour-long vigil).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting—ice-cathedral flora, body, and tuning fork—functions as micro-environment that constrains every action: gloved fingers, thermal color reads, glass fracture physics. Spatial choreography stays coherent in one chamber. The Conservatory reframed as instrument is the final resonator that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled with first sentence: “translate silence into music.” Single pressure arc: Bloom fading = silenced “song.” One meaningful tightening—the fracture—narrowing rescue to one vibrating fork. Cost is physical endurance and irreversible time/labor; no off-page rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges recursively: silence is not void but latent harmony. The Bloom’s thermal shift from sick grey to fierce gold is the argument realized, not stated. Final image (“universe hum”) is a resonant CR that reframes earlier wave-trauma without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Present-tense lyric compression mirrors Elara’s tuned silence. Perceptual signature—“profound, absolute silence,” “faint warmth… a desperate blue”—is biased to thermal vision and haptic vibration, never generic. Rhythm mirrors tuning fork oscillations. No voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft shows near-pristine density: “the universe hum” is the only abstract stretch but it pays off. Elsewhere every noun/verb does two jobs—“ghost of a note,” “crystallized web of golden warmth.” One micro redundancy: “frigid aisles with reverence that was silently expressive”—felt/told overlap—dents but doesn’t obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sensory inversion—sound through touch-temperature—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Cryogenic conservatory as acoustic laboratory is freshly specific, not stock fantasy. Risk taken (non-verbal protagonist conducting silent symphony) pays coherent closure, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: story collapses if venue changes.</comment>
