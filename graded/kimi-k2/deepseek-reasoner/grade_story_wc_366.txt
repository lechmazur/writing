<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elvan’s reticence and observant nature are embodied in micro-choices—scanning the room, noting the cairn, deciding to relight the lamp. The final acceptance of keeper-hood is earned by the spectral letters’ weight and the visible cost of solitude he embraces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elvan relights the lamp and builds a new cairn, accepting lifelong guardianship. Causal chain—dark lamp → letters → cairn warning → relight—holds cleanly; the cost is the solitude he now shoulders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern room’s cold brass, moaning wind, and stacked stones are filtered through Elvan’s wary gaze, constraining his decision to relight the lamp. The sea glass on the sill reappears in the final image, charging the closure with spectral continuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping ships safe—tightens when the lamp dies and the ghost fails. Elvan’s decisive act of relighting narrows his future to permanent isolation; the cost is palpable in the final cairn he builds for others’ safe passage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship across mortality emerges through the letter chain and Elvan’s silent acceptance. The luminescent ache of the ghost’s final line reweights the sea glass and cairn into a wordless covenant, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elvan’s taciturn perception; diction is salt-stung and spare, rhythm echoing the climb and the hush. No head-hop; the spectral voice is mediated entirely through found text, preserving POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense without clutter—“the great lens was a cold, dead eye” does double duty. No loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final line crystallizes the new covenant cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-keeper correspondence reframes the haunted-lighthouse trope into a quiet meditation on duty beyond death. Specificity of sea glass and stone cairns grounds the supernatural in tactile ritual, making the premise feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
