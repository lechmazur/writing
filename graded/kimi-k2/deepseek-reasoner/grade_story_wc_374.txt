<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism is embodied through synesthetic tasting and micro-choices (twisting the ring, placing her hand). The final convergence choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of self/place). Interiority is specific, but the anchor’s loneliness is stated more than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elara and the anchor vanish, the bluff left with only a new taste. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (taste, light, scent) intensifies until departure. Cost is legible in the final image: “they were gone.” No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora are not mere backdrop; their scent and light are siphoned into the compass, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the ring’s warmth and the bending lavender track. Micro-setting (ring, taste) functions as setting and charges closure. One hairline slip: “lavender around them bent” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding personal weather—tightens into the larger convergence. One meaningful deepening: the ring’s frantic spin → stillness → departure. Cost is felt in the vanishing and the new taste on the wind. Agency is shared but Elara’s final hand-placement seals the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the cost of cosmic empathy, the limits of empirical skepticism. Final image (tin-lavender-after-storm taste) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (taste, compass, nebula) reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, precise, and character-bound (“tinfoil,” “sunlit attic jam”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“It’s happening”). One minor register drift: “conceptual integrity” in anchor’s speech feels slightly expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“nebula of grief”). Rhythm modulates with pressure. One near-miss: “terrestrially cosmic” could read as oxymoronic clutter, but context justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic weather-reading + cosmic anchor + emergent compass. Tropes (lonely star-man, chosen skeptic) are transformed through specific sensory logic and earned departure. Risk-taking (vanishing protagonists) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
