<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory grief—trying to resurrect vs. accepting transformation—drives every tactical beat. Embodied emotion (hand passing through Fenrir’s shoulder) yields credible Earned Stasis, visible cost in final merging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: cosmic merging reconfigures “bond” from beast-and-master to two co-existing essences. Causality tightens under Accumulative lens; spice trigger links early set-up to final image with unambiguous emotional/cosmic cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard (permanent moonlight, spice-scented air) functions as crucible: blossoms constrain visibility while dream-root fragrance enables the spectral conjuring. One silver-barked tree is micro-setting tool used in embodied gait shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation—reforge bond beyond death—grows from memory to cosmic renunciation. Phoenix ascent isn’t backdrop; it charges the tightening when the specter proves untouchable, raising the cost of transformation vs. resurrection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Privilege: reluctant acceptance of new form, set against cosmic intimacy final image. Runs through early memory sketch, spice spell backlash, wolf-shade failure, then acceptance merge, tightening stakes without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fairytale lyric voice stays grounded—concrete spice scents, silver bark in hand—avoiding purple swaths. Compression at peaks (“universe aligning to her will”) brink before diction soars. Interior POV airtight, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Compression at scene peak keeps 2–3 lines per beat. A minor swirl—“crystallized consent beneath starlight”—earns poetic license; no scaffold loops. Read-aloud rhythm peaks on final line “a girl and a constellation of memory.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Magic‑bond resurrection reworked into cosmic essence love affair; fresh but leans fairytale template. Specific transformation image (girl stepping into spectral wolf, becoming note) distinguishes from stock ghost-pet stories.</comment>
