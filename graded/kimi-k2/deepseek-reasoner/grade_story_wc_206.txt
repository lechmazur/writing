<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “wilts near dishonesty” trait is dramatized through physical collapse. Motivation to reclaim light is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final choice—tethering her spirit—carries visible cost (nausea, buckling knees) and earns the restoration of the song. Minor slip: the soldier’s backstory is delivered in summary rather than dramatized choice, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat follows “because/therefore” logic from diagnosis to tethering to cleansing. Closure is a Decisive Change—the lie is purged, light reclaimed—paid for by Elara’s bodily weakness. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One micro-turn suffices at this length. Cost is legible on the page (“wilts… knees buckling”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Resonance Chamber is more than backdrop; its acoustic amplification cues Elara’s diagnostic method and later the cleansing light. Brass gears, oil stains, and the glowing crystal are tactile and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The chamber’s rule (sound = meaning) constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: discovery of shadow → physical cost → tethering → cleansing. One meaningful tightening: the tether forces a trade-off between her vitality and the soldier’s truth. Cost is visible and alters later tactics (weariness acknowledged before next project).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. deception emerges organically through the music box’s corrupted song and Elara’s bodily reaction. Subtext in the soldier’s shame is conveyed via sensory memory, not exposition. Final image—golden light spilling from the box—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the man’s choice remains his own.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “tinkersong” and “covenant of rust” feel native to Elara’s diction. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during collapse, longer cadences during repair. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly interior. Distinct perceptual signature: she hears “discord in its soul,” not mechanical clatter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“acid in her soul”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor elevated diction (“philosopher’s stone”) is justified by world rules. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—repairing metaphysical lies via music boxes—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (philosopher’s stone, shadow-as-lie) are transformed through Elara’s bodily cost and acoustic metaphysics. Specificity of the “tinkersong” and “covenant of rust” anchors universals. Risky tethering sequence pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
