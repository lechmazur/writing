<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the donor-heart beat is a tactile micro-choice that tilts her stance. The dye master’s silence and precise gesture create status pressure, but her explanatory monologue slightly flattens the crucible. The final empathy-bloom is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s understanding reframes her quest with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—light density increases until the wing’s map reweights the premise. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and valley mist are not postcard backdrops; the suspended silence and filtered sun literally enable the dye master’s sun-trail method, constraining how the climax can unfold. Micro-setting (wing as sky-fragment) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some magnetize stories—tightens once when Elara realizes she need not attract but refract. The deepening is driven by her attention shift under Accumulative pressure; cost is the irreversible acceptance of another’s prism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: every life is a prism refracting shared light. The wing’s final map offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in the master’s silence and Elara’s heartbeat deepens the question rather than resolving it neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s cautious wonder. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short, percussive beats under the master’s tweezers, longer breaths in the mist. No head-hopping; focalization remains locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Figurative language is selective—sun trails, seed cracking—never crowding a beat. Zero loops or scaffold; the final line crystallizes earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—donor heart as inherited perceptual prism—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the illuminated wing. Specificity of the dye master’s craft and the tea house’s suspension prevents generic overlay.</comment>
