<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her “peripherally focused” trait is dramatized through sonic mapping and micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (“store wonder”) is embodied in every beat, culminating in the earned smile and pack-stowage that forecloses further tinkering. The only gap is a near-perfect competence that softens struggle; a single gear-slip or doubt would have deepened flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward-whirring timer releases the stored sigh, reweighting the premise from repair to preservation. Causal chain—tap-mapping → angle deduction → harmonic trigger—holds without gaps. Cost is palpable in the melancholic gold light and the irrevocable capture of a moment now gone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument; its acoustic curves constrain every tactic and deliver the final harmonic chord. Sensory detail is selective—veined floor, drip metronome, indigo evening—filtered through Elara’s locksmith ear. One hairline slip: the “natural flute of stone” arrives late and could have been seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture a vanishing season’s echo—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking lull. Escalation is accretive: each sonic test narrows the possible convergence angle until the final breeze-driven chord triggers the device. Cost is the loss of that last sigh; felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the preservation of wonder through reason’s machinery. The timer’s backward spin reframes the entire quest—repair becomes retrieval, loss becomes gift. No moralizing; the final image of Elara packing the glowing device is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is contemplative, tactile, and acoustically precise—“the cool, still air,” “filaments of brass she had warmed.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, tightens during testing. No dialogue, yet the prose carries subtext through sonic description alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet resonant; every sentence advances map, tool, or mood. Figurative language is sparse and exact—“melancholic gold,” “silent, final tick.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure flawlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “harvest of echoes” premise is fresh, executed through acoustic engineering rather than magic. Tropes of the tinkerer-hermit and broken artifact are transformed by the sonic-science lens. The final backward-whir feels inevitable yet non-obvious, a synthesis of prior particulars.</comment>
