<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leo’s benevolent ghost-whispering adds interior contradiction—duty versus fear—and every tactile detail (dust, brass, mainspring) is filtered through his obsessive technician’s lens; the ghost’s smile at fade-out earns his arc without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tight causal chain: breadcrumb dust → mainspring → cylinder → release; no luck, no padding. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (peace replaces anxiety) with visible cost—the ghost gone, the ceiling’s weight finally known.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is weaponized: decaying circus dust, cold plaster cracks, and the ticking mainspring function like a set of pressure plates guiding Leo’s choices. Specific selective detail advances story over mood. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: give the ghost rest. Security-door risk, hidden ceiling compartment, and ticking engine ratchet pressure to a single crystallized turn—insert the barrel, accept silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “truth lodged between floors” emerges organically: each beat presses Leo to decide whose stories get fixed—machines or ghosts. The final bell chimes a non-literal answer without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Crisp, tactile technician vocabulary and rhythmic short clauses mirror Leo’s hyper-voice under ghost pressure. Dust motes flickering like signals stream directly through his biased perceptual filter; zero head-hops.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence telescopes story, not filler. "Dust-thin semicircle…as if someone had recently rested their palm there" delivers double duty—choreographing discovery and haunting stakes with no fat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The elevator-mechanic-stumbles-into-ghost-mystery angle feels fresh, not boilerplate, because the theft of the orchestra’s heart is specific circus clockwork lore; the mainspring return functions as irreparable device.</comment>
