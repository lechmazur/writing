<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s resolve is embodied in micro-choices—feeling the courtyard, grinding powders, tracing the mosaic. Doubt surfaces as embodied chill, then is overridden by the remembered command, locking motive to final act. No cliché interiority; cost is the wager of light against night. The only lag is the historian client being a wisp off-stage, not pressuring her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with the exact azure-and-gold blossom, a reenactment of mosaic memory; silence transformed is the Decisive Change, paid on the page with the fortress “finally lifted.” Causal linkage is held via the mosaic instruction, the knot fuse, the ascending flower—each beat narrows doubt into single yes-fire. Orientation anchors arrive comfortably before 120 words. No lens mismatch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Elara’s artisan perception—cloying mortar, vaulted ceiling, “starless black.” The Blooming Fortress functions as an architectural lung: its stone petals receive luminous rain that reweights the ending’s air. Micro-setting is tactile, but fortress-scale geography remains lightly sketched; thus short of the 9+ gate requiring constraint to final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“one brief light against enduring night”—is signaled early and escalates with rising silence and visible cost of every flare. One tightening beat where doubt collides with the mosaic’s “Remember” crystallizes resolve, narrowing choice to ignite. Escalation is situational pressure against ambience rather than external antagonist, but feels sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mnemonic illumination emerges through images, never stated: light as defiance, memory as weapon against “hopelessness.” Final image re-embodies the mosaic promise, supplying closure without moralizing. The serious playfulness of the tone undercuts sentimentality, but the thematic depth could have been sharpened by seeding earlier flashbacks or costs specific to Elara’s history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Free-indirect lyric under pressure: kinesthetic verbs (“crunch,” “tangled,” “trace”) ride a rhythmic chant mirroring pacing steps. POV remains tautly interior, zero head-hopping, vocabulary grounded in craft (tesserae, gunpowder). Final cadence modulates from low hum to silent bloom, syntax thinning to match hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose pulses with controlled figurative charge—“sanguine light bled,” “stone petals unfurled against violet”—without overwritten sprawl. Sentences vary across breathing beats; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Only minor density spike in “radiant rain watering stone petals,” but momentum survives. High density, near-zero artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fireworks-as-ritual-cleansing trope is refreshed by pairing it with an echoing mosaic relic, blending performance art, archaeology, and gothic fortress. Personal ritual fused with civilizational memory feels fresh; no direct genre echo. Stakes remain human-scaled yet mythic; originality lies in treating light itself as memory incarnate.</comment>
