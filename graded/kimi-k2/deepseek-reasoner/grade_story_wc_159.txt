<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiorization of “foxglove regret” and the felt doom of the library’s final silence gives her renunciation of passive caretaking into active remembrance bite; her humming shift carries palpable cost as the bamboo threads deeper each time, all cleanly tied to the climax. The humming choice fuses contradictory drives: preservation vs. recognition. No slips.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara knowingly lets the cracked bamboo finish its job while the museum is emptied into song—a clear “before/after.” The Accumulative/Textural lens of layered sonic bloom images threads to a resonant cadence suffice without causal turn overload. The crack widening provides the persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal shelved clouds, crystal ghost-flowers, and fracturing wind-tool each press tactics: the setting’s frost altitude demands the humming body itself become a resonator, charging the final image when the last petal sighs. Sensory detail is curated rather than exhaustive, always filtering through Elara’s selective attention under low light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve any sound before the chime dies”—gains one precise tightening when the bamboo’s definitive fade forces launch of nightly cataloging; that clock is palpable. Agency: Elara replaces mechanical resonance with her own throat, a cost in voice and surrender of legacy tool.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—that remembrance is an act of creative destruction—emerges through the structural resonance of humming atop relic, not editorial comment. The foxglove regret blooms into tempered peace; final image whispers the theme rather than pronounces it, reweights the entire premise of sterile preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric with restrained diction, mirroring Elara’s meticulous caretaker precision; sentence rhythms stretch or tighten to echo faint glissandi of retrieved names. Compression (“This was the museum…”) is taught early and legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Zero false expertise or jargon drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean of scaffold; sentences alternate cadence with sound pressure. Metaphors “glass orchids glowing with soft inner light” remain bounded by literal rules of resonance, never overwritten. Final line’s ghostly woven tapestry achieves crisp poise without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystallized-library-of-feelings premise feels instantly inevitable yet freshly minted; no recent parallel uses humming caretaker as resonant key—transformative specificity. The cracked bamboo evolves flaw into precise tool rather than blunt limitation—absolutely not swappable.</comment>
