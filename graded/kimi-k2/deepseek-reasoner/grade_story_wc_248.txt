<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—destructive fire vs. curatorial rescue—are dramatized in every beat; the final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost as she leaves the tapestry exposed. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“volcanic tenderness,” “magma” urge). Micro-choices (selective burning, crowbar, final hanging) reveal a hierarchy of values. The vandalized self-portrait arc is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry on the university wall reweights the premise from hoarding to shared knowledge, with undeniable social cost (her anonymity, possible arrest). Causal chain—burn → reveal → weave → gift—holds under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the moment she chooses not to burn the final tapestry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the municipal annex’s “aging bones” guide the break-in; the sealed archive’s cool dust contrasts the fire above and constrains her movements. The tapestry fragment itself functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities—soot, stone groan, muted ochres. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise of shared knowledge—tightens when she confronts the urge to keep the archive secret. One decisive reversal: from arsonist-hoarder to public benefactor, paid for by personal risk. Pressure escalates because each fire narrows her safety margin. Cost is visible in the final tableau: her exile continues while the crowd deciphers her gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living tapestry vs. commodified fragments. Subtext resides in gesture—fire as both erasure and revelation, weaving as both creation and map. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the tapestry on the wall reconfigures history without moralizing. No thematic drift; every image serves the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “volcanic tenderness,” “surgical rage.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s analytical intuition—long, clause-rich sentences for planning; staccato fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; academic vocabulary is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with tension. Zero loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“Conceptual Repricing”) is justified by the intellectual stakes. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist as curator, fire as archival tool. The Kythian tapestry culture feels specific and lived. Risk-taking (burning libraries to save knowledge) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if Elara is merely a thief. Final reconfiguration—public tapestry as living archive—is inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
