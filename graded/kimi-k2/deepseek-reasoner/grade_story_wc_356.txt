<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. stillness—is embodied in her frantic soil-tending and later tempered reverence; the micro-choice of idle doodling crystallizes the shift. The final inhalation of decay carries visible cost (acceptance of mortality). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scent, storm, and doodle builds density until the bloom reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s stance crystallizes as she breathes rot and finds peace; the cost is the surrender of her driven urgency. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The treetop village’s damp moss scent and hanging bridges constrain her daily tending rituals; the corpse-flower pot becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, never touristic. Environment subtly guides her slowing pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivate inner stillness—tightens when frantic effort fails and the storm forces a cadence shift. One meaningful deepening: the doodle beat redefines tactics from striving to receptivity. Cost is the forfeiture of control, legible in her changed tending posture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges from the corpse flower’s decay-to-life cycle; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights earlier ambition as compost for acceptance. Subtext in the doodled vines and smiling moons links father’s gift to her earned poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: olfactory metaphors (“air tasted… iron-like memory of the distant sea”) and rhythmic modulation under storm pressure. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression in storm lullaby is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “wildflower hush” does triple duty for tone, setting, and theme. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. Rhythm breathes with beats—short clauses during storm, longer cadences at bloom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse-flower-as-teacher trope inverted—stench is embraced, not overcome. Doodle-on-wrapping-paper custom feels specific and non-obvious. Risk in lyric stillness pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
