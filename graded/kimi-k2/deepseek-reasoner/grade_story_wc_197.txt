<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “heart hammered against her ribs” as she weighs safety vs. resistance. The contradiction between panic and resourcefulness is dramatized in micro-choices (puddle map, culvert drop). The final endurance/renunciation (“she would reappear tomorrow”) forecloses retreat with felt cost. One hairline slip: “bedraggled woman walking home” is a label rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s choice to run toward the light crystallizes her stance and forecloses safety. Causal chain (dead-drop sealed → puddle map → key → booth → skiff) is tight; each beat narrows options. Cost is legible in the final image—filthy, hunted, yet resolved. No orientation debt; lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the “auric lagoon” constrains movement and charges the final image with toxic beauty. Micro-setting (phone booth base panel) functions as lock for the key. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather (spring shower) creates the puddle map, directly shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. indifference—is signaled early and tightened when the dead-drop vanishes. Escalation is causal: each discovery (puddle map, booth, patrol) raises cost. Final choice to run toward light crystallizes stance with visible risk. One minor slack: patrol coincidence complicates rather than resolves, but feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as coded freedom is dramatized through objects (key, documents) and actions (puddle reading). Final image of toxic lagoon mirroring stars reweights the premise—beauty inseparable from poison. No moralizing; resonance is felt, not stated. Complexity lingers: resistance is necessary yet contaminated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s wary precision. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadence in reflection, clipped fragments under searchlight. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “auric lagoon” is earned by prior sensory logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense. Figurative language is selective (“velvety black pierced by cold, sharp stars”) and never muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. One near-repeat: “safe against her skin” echoes “precious documents safe” but separated enough to avoid penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—sanctioned amnesia resisted by tactile memory objects—is fresh yet grounded. Transformation test: story fails without the key, lagoon, and puddle map. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to make toxic waste beautiful pays off, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
