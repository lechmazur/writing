<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—duty to truth vs. duty to city—are dramatized in the stamp-flip beat. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits immediate justice to guard deeper truth. One hairline slip: “tranquilly perceptive” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s deliberate mislabeling forecloses whistle-blowing with felt moral cost. Causal chain—blackout → access → stamp → palimpsest → choice—holds without gaps. Lens is Causal; blackout pressure tightens options stepwise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken library is evoked through tactile navigation and the groaning ceiling; the antique stamp becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Light/dark motif mirrors knowledge layers. One minor drift: “dappled resolve” is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. civic stability—escalates as blackout removes surveillance, letting palimpsest surface. Single decisive tightening: stamp reveals surrender terms, forcing Elara’s covert preservation. Cost is moral complicity, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried conquest emerges organically from the palimpsest beat; no moralizing. Final image of FALSE COPY tag reweights all prior cataloging as complicit silence. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is calm, analytical, slightly oceanic; perceptual signature filters every detail through indexer’s taxonomic mind. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She pressed down, the mechanism clicking softly”—without losing coherence. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“velvet silence”—is minor and early, not near closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian-as-keeper-of-suppressed-conquest via antique stamp palimpsest. Risky inversion of heroic truth-teller trope feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of underwater archive and stamp mechanics grounds the concept.</comment>
