<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her cartographer mind maps the temporal fold—but her contradictory impulses (quest vs. survival) surface only in summary, not simultaneous scene tension. The final renunciation (diminished fragment) is earned yet stated more than embodied. No second character on page, so status crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loop unravels into “luminous, geometric dust,” reweighting time’s texture with felt cost (fragment dimmed). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift drive the climax. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Living Bridge Garden is rendered through tactile, purposeful detail (moss “pulsed with a slow, vegetative heartbeat”) that constrains Elara’s choices and charges the final image. Micro-setting (fragment in hand) functions as setting-as-tool. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—perceive time’s texture—tightens when the fragment’s resonance traps her; the hyperbolic escape is a visible cost that forecloses further use. One meaningful deepening suffices. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time as “infinitely fragile” hyperbolic surface. Subtext lives in the fading photographs’ silent erasure. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. One near-label (“texture of time”) is brief enough to waive penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature is precise (“vegetative heartbeat,” “grain of old film”). No dialogue, so voice purity judged on narrative texture alone. Rhythm modulates with crisis—short staccato sentences under temporal strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective, never clotted. One minor paraphrase loop (“the world did not just brighten; it deepened”) is offset by added sensory shift. No artifacts in final third. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze designer meets non-Euclidean arboreal time-prison. The hyperbolic escape feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of “fading photographs” as chronicle of erasure is memorable. No derivative echoes.</comment>
