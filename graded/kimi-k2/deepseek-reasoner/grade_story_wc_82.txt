<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile craft and micro-choices (folding cranes, polishing amber, releasing dream). The final renunciation—letting the luminous crane ascend—earns its cost through prior causal chain; sorrow visibly lifts yet love remains. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. One slip: “her spirit descend while ascending” edges toward abstraction, but the embodied action of release keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density (lopsided cranes → flawed amber → basilica lantern → living light-crane) until the final image reweights grief into monument. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the crane’s flight crystallizes stakes and cost without tidy resolution. No orientation debt; causality intact. The island’s paradoxical orbit mirrors interior state and pays off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden, ozone-jasmine air, and silver-leaf bushes are vivid yet selective. The miniature basilica lantern itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice—she must climb to the garden’s peak to release it. Amber gem and glass spires charge the last image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief or be consumed by it—signaled early. Pressure tightens through failed cranes, then crystallizes in the lantern’s completion; releasing the dream forecloses retreat. Cost is the irreversible loss of the last recording, made visceral as the light folds into crane form. Agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into living art emerges organically from craft and choice; no moralizing. The luminous crane is a non-literal answer to the unspoken question of how to remember without being paralyzed. Subtext in the island’s gravitational paradox and the amber’s “ghost-light” deepens resonance. Final image reweights all prior failures into sacred legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lantern-maker precise: “subtle geometries of light,” “thermal updrafts,” “glass architecture.” Syntax breathes with emotional tempo—longer sentences for craft, clipped release at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara’s perceptual bias. One near-slip: “luminous torment” twice, but the second instance is recontextualized in closure, earning its echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“captured firefly’s ghost-light,” “stained-glass beautiful”—each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Sentence variety supports momentum; no filler. Final paragraph achieves crystalline cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of lantern craft, dream recording, and origami grief is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The paradoxical island orbit and light-crane creation feel specific to this world and voice. No derivative echoes; tropes are transformed through tactile detail and earned emotional physics. Risk-taking (non-ghost resurrection via craft) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
