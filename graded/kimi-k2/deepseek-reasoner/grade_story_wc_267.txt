<question>1</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior “sharp cold needle” and Leo’s embodied silence both act under pressure, but the reflection‐splice from the architect’s journal keeps her conflict largely interpretive rather than lived in the same on-page turn. The “remember but not be silent” micro-choice lands, yet the emotional cost is more intellectual pivot than visceral wound.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage (journal → realized cost) holds cleanly; orientation anchors early, and the final Renounce/Remember beat earns a visible after-scene silence that reconfigures her stance. Cost is legible on page: “they would not be silent.”</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The fortress, staircase, and hidden chamber do constrain movement and discovery, but the climactic power is carried more by ideation than by the material world closing options. Still, the staircase step as physical lever and the frost-dulled hospital air ground stakes and perception.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—safety versus truth—is immediately stated, and the cost sharpens once Elara sees the architect’s despair. Escalation is single-tilt but effective; no secondary reversals or losses beyond emotional forfeiture keep pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of safety’s silent cost emerges silently itself, born of concrete objects (journal, Leo’s silence) rather than lecture. Final image reweights the premise without sermon, achieving thematic resonance while staying understated.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perched, spare syntax and crystalline image—”world still looked soft and blurred at the edges,” “frostbitten hope”—build a singular lyric voice. Compression does patterned work early and lands legibly, with no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is rhythm-tight, each clause doing two jobs; minor loops such as “dusty spiral staircase… dusty spiral staircase” are the only blemish. Images are sharp, verbs active, momentum unflagging.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Co-opting refuge into prison is familiar, but the coupling of muted Leo-as-angel-bellhop and the secret step-as-bolt mechanism feels fresh. Risk is moderate; transformation is felt rather than radically novel.</comment>
