<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aris's contradictory desire to quantify emotion is dramatized through embodied action—ink-stained hands, the press-lever pull—culminating in the final renunciation when he abandons the borrowed mask after the stars' collective grief floods him. The cost is unmistakable: the spent, dark fragment and the ache of authentic feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Accum/CR moment: "It was not a formula… but a language" reweights the entire premise with the star-grief image. Cost is visible—the halo fragment "utterly spent"—and the drive lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The topaz geode walls and vanishing stars are not mere scenery; their hummed starlight actively feeds ink, while the void above provides the emotional datum that finally drowns Aris. Setting constrains and recharges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Initial stake—understand emotional quantification—tightens via the halo experiment and explodes into the experiential flood; Aris's deliberate choice to stop borrowing personalities is the earned reversal that forecloses old tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes emerge from action: empathy as lived risk rather than solved equation. The stars' sorrow reframes the entire quest without a moral uttered—resonance delivered through the fragment's black print on vellum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The prose is crystalline, disciplined, yet emotionally heated; short percussive clauses accelerate under the flood of borrowed lives. No single sentence repeats, and voice remains anchored to Aris’s meticulous press-operator perceptual bias.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm accelerates with each metaphysical beat—no loop, no redundancy. Highest information density arrives at crisis: “He was himself, but also the lonely miner…”—one sentence doing triple sensory-cognitive-ethical work.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fresh synthesis—emotion as living mathematics, stars grieving humanity’s filter—turns a familiar philosophical quest into visceral ordeal. It earns every step, never defaulting to stock imagery.</comment>
