<comment>Elara’s interiority embodies the collision between her autonomy and the alien memories—her drumming choices externalize the conflict without authorial lecture. The sorrow is viscerally felt, yet the moment of fusion with Kael’s brief apparition earns its ache by costing her the shared future it promises.</comment>

<comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Each memory-layered tap tightens the stake until the lagoon’s light re-configures the whole experience; the final pulse reweights prior material with a felt sense of irrevocable separation.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The Sound Wave Garden, gown chill, and bioluminescent lagoon supply immediate constraining textures; the warm rock and vibrating water literalize the sensory stakes that shape each next tap. The pool’s evolving glow actively charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The sole external antagonist is the imposed experiment itself; tension escalates as each rhythmic choice raises the cost of confirmation. The tightening culminates when the conjured figure dissolves, foreclosing the possibility of further union with an unmistakable on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between scientific control and yearned intimacy; the closing image of shared loss reframes the experiment’s brutality without stating it. Ambiguity over who owns the sorrow invites reflection instead of moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Third-person limited voice stays anchored in Elara’s skin; rhythmic syntax mirrors the drum-beat motif. Perceptual signature (“auroral sorrow,” “bioluminescent currents”) is consistent and never drifts into over-explained abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Prose is vivid and syntactically varied, yet occasional ornament (“placid auroral sorrow,” “liquid mirror alive with shimmering, bioluminescent currents”) verges on purple. No clarity lapses in the closure image, but density is a whisker over the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</question>
<comment>The entangled-memory premise and sensory-drum language feel fresh; the transformation of failed science into communal elegy is specific and inevitable. Still, the lyrical sorrow itself leans on a familiar tone, keeping originality shy of truly singular.</comment>
