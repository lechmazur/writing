<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied and specific; the amber ritual crystallizes her arc. The mentor’s absence limits relational crucible, but her self-confrontation is credible and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the amber absorbs the cry, the firmware is cleansed, and Elara’s guilt is laid to rest with visible cost. Causal chain from letters → modified rig → amber sink holds under a hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “meteor hush” lab and the pulsing amber function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; spatial anchors are clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silencing the haunted cry—is signaled early and tightened when the letters reveal the loop. One decisive turn: rerouting the scream into amber. Cost is the permanent lodging of her infant grief in fossil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of guilt as recursive haunting emerges through the corrupted firmware and amber prison. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the insect “at peace” mirrors Elara’s earned stillness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “meteor hush,” “jagged screaming spectrograms,” and “tiny golden tomb” carry perceptual signature. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Final cadence is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Constellation-tattooist, haunted firmware, and amber-as-data-sink synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
