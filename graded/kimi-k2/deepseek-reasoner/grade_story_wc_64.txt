<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, stubborn happiness and her embodied tending of graves anchor her interiority; the final realization that her tools are for resurrection crystallizes a credible shift in motive with visible cost—she must now act on the knowledge. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cemetery’s meaning flips from memorial to seed vault, reweighting every prior image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned density of tapestry threads and flowers accrues until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the charged poise of Elara holding the glowing knot, ready to begin a task whose burden is now clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The cobalt silo, glow-orb light, and tactile tapestry threads constrain every move; the silo’s hum and starlight charge the final image. Selective sensory detail filters through Elara’s gardener’s eye, grounding the speculative frame without exposition. One notch below 9 only because the environment does not physically impede her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the world’s intention—tightens once when the golden thread reveals the sovereign case, then deepens again when the knot redefines the cemetery’s purpose. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual but unmistakable. No external antagonist is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy as dormant hope rather than grief. The tapestry border’s shift from chaos to perfect knot enacts the conceptual repricing without moralizing. Final image of resurrection-ready gardener reframes every flower and stone, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a gardener’s tactile lexicon and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so single-POV coherence is flawless. Occasional elevated phrasing (“profound hope”) nicks the 9-band but remains within character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and meaning without loops. Metaphors are fresh and consistent (“velveteen gloom,” “genetic memory”). One mixed metaphor (“hummed with a low, perpetual energy”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The seed-vault cemetery and tapestry-manual are a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes, transformed through Elara’s specific vocation. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in quiet speculative lyricism pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
