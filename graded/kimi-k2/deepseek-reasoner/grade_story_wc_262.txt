<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination is embodied in the tactile way she handles the film and the booth. The projectionist’s unspoken love is rendered through specific, sensory choices (ink-stained fingers, velvet rope). The final hand-off crystallizes a lifetime of waiting with visible cost on both women. Minor slip: the client’s reaction is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the “unused love” is reweighted from a place to a message, delivered in a Charged Poise moment. Causality holds—every beat flows from Elara’s psychometry to the projectionist’s filmed confession to the usher’s tear. One transition (booth → auditorium) is legible and motivated. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The projection booth’s dust, brass fittings, and warm platen constrain Elara’s actions and incubate the vision. Micro-setting—the film strip itself—functions as both tool and portal. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and heat, narrowing perception under pressure. Final image of the empty auditorium recharges the “hushed thunder” motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the unused love—tightens once: from “where is it stored?” to “it was waiting to be delivered.” Escalation is accumulative: each frame decoded increases emotional density until the tear confirms cost. Agency remains Elara’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: love is not lost but deferred, stored in acts of creation rather than places. Subtext operates in silence—the tear is the only “dialogue.” Final image reframes the palace from mausoleum to sanctuary without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers: was the wait worth it?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “hushed thunder” and “golden light” feel earned, not ornamental. Psychometry sequence uses clean, cinematic syntax that mirrors projection. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Elara. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it passes the ear test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional information. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (celluloid as love-letter) are coherent and tied to closure. Rhythm accelerates during the vision, then exhales in the auditorium. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychometric film-reading to deliver decades-old love—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (abandoned cinema, unspoken love) are transformed through the projectionist’s spatially imaginative “filmed letter.” Specificity of brass fittings and velvet ropes grounds the fantasy. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
