<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to sever the past yet clutching its blueprint—play out in embodied micro-choices (gripping the camera, stepping off the platform). The ghost’s “I am your blueprint” crystallizes her internal conflict and forces a stance shift with visible cost: she must shoulder the unexposed film. Minor slip: “regret softened” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied turn outweighs it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carousel’s stillness reconfigures from prison to blank page, the camera wheel reframed as future agency. Causal chain holds—ghost’s revelation stems from the camera offering, Elara’s final walk flows from that reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the “weightless, perfect burden” of unexposed film. One micro-turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon’s cloud-moss and ozone-mist anchor POV bias and constrain movement (soft footing, temporal drift). The camera wheel doubles as micro-setting, its cold edges anchoring Elara in “temporal soup.” Final image of the halted carousel recharges the setting as a blank page. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by ~100 words.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release from regret—tightens when the ghost reframes regret as blueprint, foreclosing the path of severance. Escalation is one deepening beat under Situational lens: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization. Cost is the unexposed film she must now carry; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of eroded ambition re-emerges as reshaped foundation, never stated but earned through the camera’s transformation from token of failure to tool of possibility. Final image (“start by taking a picture”) offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “unclear” path ahead.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, slightly lyric, with perceptual signature (“sound of the carousel’s old gears grinding”). POV remains tight; no head-hop. Compression (“temporal soup”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “And do what?” carries the ghost’s challenge.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each line advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (“cloud-like moss,” “rusted pipes”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at climax. Clean mechanics; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—negotiating one’s own ghost via a disposable camera—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transforms trope of spectral confrontation into internal partnership. Specificity of the carousel relic and cloud-moss setting resists generic fantasy. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
