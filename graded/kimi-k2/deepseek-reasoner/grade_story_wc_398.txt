<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the vineyard metaphor anchors her contradictory impulses. The final stance—offering Leo a shared vigil rather than a fix—earns its cost through prior parallels. Minor slip: “passionate subtlety” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion glows around two sentinels who now share a “quiet kind of love.” Causal chain—letter → memory → parallel → confession → stance shift—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the unspoken truth they now carry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and autumn vines are not backdrop; they supply the graft metaphor that reframes Leo’s loss and Elara’s response. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through her caretaker gaze. One spatial hiccup: “eastern edge” is mentioned once and never re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving sorrow is not borne alone—tightens when Elara pivots from solitary search to mutual witness. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost (shared vigil without remedy) is visible. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “mismatched unions” emerges organically from grafted vines and failed love; no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: some unions teach the soil, not the harvest. Subtext in Leo’s confession and Elara’s silence carries the emotional freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in viticulture idiom; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“a cork sealing her”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext; Leo’s diction briefly converges with Elara’s, reading intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“etched the pain deeper into the memory of the place”—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The graft-as-love conceit is fresh, and the refusal to “resolve” Leo’s grief feels honest. Risk lies in the quiet ending; it pays off via Charged Poise. No close echoes; transformation test passes—swap vines for wheat and the arc collapses.</comment>
