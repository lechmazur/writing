<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her cautious exuberance shows in the micro-choice to risk the eclipse moment. Leo’s silence and sudden tear-tracked speech land as earned because the curl and cosmic dark re-weight his grief. The only gap: we never feel Elara’s own fear of failure, so the cost to her feels muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Leo’s whisper re-opens his voice and re-prices the curl from relic to key. Causal chain—music fails → eclipse plan → curl hand-off → speech—holds cleanly. The eclipse coincidence complicates rather than rescues, satisfying Situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge hills, oak hollow, and eclipse twilight are vivid yet selective; the curl’s “pale gold strand almost glowing” charges the final image. Spatial choreography under the roots is coherent. Setting constrains choice by offering the hollow as refuge and cosmic theatre.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Leo’s voice—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: music fails → eclipse gamble. The cost is Leo’s first audible crack of grief and Elara’s wager of therapeutic safety. Agency remains hers; coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates, does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through specific events: a baby curl + eclipse = cosmic ring. No moralizing; final whisper lets the image re-weight memory and wonder. Subtext in Elara’s withheld speech and Leo’s tear carries the emotional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“softly adaptive,” “cautious exuberance”) is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with tension—long lyrical lines under the oak, then stark silence at totality. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “the black sun crowned in fire” packs sight and myth in five words. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. One mixed metaphor risk—“metallic air”—but context justifies it. Closure image is unmarred by clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-speech arc is transformed by the eclipse-curl synthesis; the cosmic ring observation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk taken: using astronomical coincidence without letting it feel contrived. Specificity of place and therapist method lifts it above template.</comment>
