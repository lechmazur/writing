<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her “quiet, unyielding necessity” drives every beat. The final declaration is earned by prior midnight runs and the bell’s arrival. Cost is visible in her mud-caked exhaustion and the communal silence that follows the bell’s ring. Minor slip: “singular motivation” is stated rather than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s ring reweights the premise from scarcity to partnership. Causal chain—failed run → sighting → bell → declaration—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in Elara’s empty hands and the community’s hushed procession. No orientation debt; geography and timeline stay coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Valley, ridge, arbor, and bell are vivid and selective; each constrains movement or charges the final image. “Sky felt like a lid” and “mossy bench” ground the stakes. Sensory hierarchy narrows under hunger and darkness. One minor drift: terra-cotta arbor’s description slightly stalls momentum before payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival via intergenerational support—is signaled early and tightened when anonymous gifts replace Elara’s failed run. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary barter to communal covenant. Cost is the forfeiture of anonymity and the implicit risk of exposure. Agency remains with Elara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mutual obligation emerges through apples, eggs, potatoes, and finally the bell—no moralizing. Subtext in the polished handle and silent procession carries the weight. Final image reframes prior scarcity as shared trust. One soft echo: “we are not alone” edges toward statement but is saved by communal hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptions; diction is spare, rhythmic, and hunger-filtered. No dialogue, so voice is carried by sensory compression and cadence. “Amplified quiet” is taught early and modulates to the bell’s clear note. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“wind humming through the pines.” No loops or scaffold. One near-repeat: “quiet, unyielding necessity” and “quiet gleam” echo “quiet” but serve tonal cohesion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia is refreshed by the anonymous-gift economy and the bell as covenant object. Specificity of heirloom barter and terra-cotta arbor grounds the myth. Risk: quiet lyricism could tip into sentimentality, but restraint keeps it earned. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>
