<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven destruction vs. secret tenderness—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the egg and the final refusal to shatter it. The interiority is specific and embodied; the warmth he imagines in the shell is a precise, character-bound hallucination. The renunciation costs him the designed echo and leaves a visible debt, satisfying the closure test. Minor slip: “amoral philanthropist” is label-adjacent, though the contradiction is quickly shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he relinquishes the egg and the planned echo, foreclosing his grand design with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, cracks, thunder lull) tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The rain erasing footprints is a crisp, legible after-cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic properties and crack-map guide every step and final placement of the egg. Sensory selection is urgent—dust on trousers, thunder lull narrowing perception. The setting constrains the choice of release point and charges the final image when the rain begins to erase the map. One hairline slip: “town shimmering on the far edge” is slightly postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to consummate the echo or relinquish it—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The crack-map and approaching thunder create coherent pressure; the final refusal narrows options with visible cost. No reversals beyond the single decisive renunciation, sufficient for this length. Cost is legible in the rain erasing his design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of preservation and destruction: the man who kills ecosystems to memorialize them must finally surrender the relic. The egg’s journey from stolen artifact to relinquished seed reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—egg left on widening cracks—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what endures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, textured, and consistent: “fractured grace,” “bruised sky,” “porcelain plate” all serve the POV’s aestheticized guilt. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences in reflection, clipped fragments as the egg is released. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct. Dialogue absent, appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with the thunder lull. Minor scaffold: “the logic was impeccable” is a touch editorial, but it is brief and early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—using a manufactured drought to create an acoustic monument to extinction—is fresh and specific. The Great Auk egg as both relic and moral fulcrum transforms a familiar eco-guilt trope into a singular act of renunciation. Risky choice to withhold the actual sound pays off in the charged silence of the ending.</comment>
