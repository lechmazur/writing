<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s cautious hope is embodied in grease-smudged hands and sleepless eyes; her interior contradiction—yearning to believe yet steeling against betrayal—drives every micro-choice. The final smile carries the cost of exhaustion and the knowledge that the war is only paused, not won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat flows “because/therefore” from signal detection → recalibration → transmission → unraveling. Closure lands as a decisive change—the town’s artificial anger dissolves—paid for by Elara’s solitary vigil and the dish’s low hum that still vibrates in her bones.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The radio-station office is sketched with selective sensory anchors—flickering lights, subsonic thrum through floorboards—that constrain her tactics and charge the final silence. Charts evolve from maps of stars to “ancient history,” reweighting the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent psychological fracture—tightens when Elara realizes the signal weaponizes subliminal anger. One meaningful escalation: her counter-frequency gambit risks the station’s power grid and her own credibility, with the felt cost of total isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “communication as defense” emerges through action: charts as battle plans, music as shield, silence as victory. Final image of dawn over a quiet town offers non-literal resonance—peace bought by the deepest whisper—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet lyrical (“ethereal grit”), modulating from cerebral chart-reading to visceral fatigue. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Elara’s trained ear and wary heart.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“malevolent complexity”) fits her academic lens. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI trope inverted into psychological-warfare defense using classical music as carrier wave. Specificity of subsonic lock-pick feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
