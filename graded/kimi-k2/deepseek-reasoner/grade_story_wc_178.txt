<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kalanu’s frugality and empirical irony are embodied in worn robes and vellum charts; his contradictory awe and calculation collide in the moment he chooses guardianship over control. The priestess supplies immediate relational pressure, forcing a stance shift. Final renunciation is earned: he accepts the burden of warden-ship, cost visible in the tile’s new weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore—discovery, confrontation, deciphering, sealing. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the covenant becomes custodianship, cost legible in the darkened tile and silent vow. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Palace shadows and ochre light filter through Kalanu’s astronomer gaze; the tile’s cool weight and glowing lattice constrain his final choice. Micro-setting (tile as cage) charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal the covenant—tightens when the priestess’s chant threatens loss of his life’s work. Escalation is causal: each calculation narrows options until the only path is guardianship. Cost is felt in the smoldering charts and the tile’s new heaviness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges through action: logic as prayer, surrender as power. Subtext in the priestess’s “surrender” versus Kalanu’s “deciphering” crystallizes in the final image of the dark tile—an unspoken vow. No moralizing; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: precise astronomical diction, tactile frugality, and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; interiority stays tightly bound to Kalanu’s empirical yet reverent lens. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“lattice, a cage”) are precise and payoff-earned. Rhythm modulates with tension—short beats at climax, longer breaths in aftermath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian magic square as celestial prison, astronomer’s math as prayer. Risky inversion—logic to contain chaos—lands with conceptual cost. No derivative echoes; specificity makes the premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
