<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—her refusal to fight the grief, her tactile mending, the moment she lifts the jade tear. Interior contradiction surfaces when the ship’s gravity of sorrow threatens to paralyze her, yet she converts that weight into buoyant action. The final smile carries visible cost: she has renounced any future of human return, sealing the species’ extinction into her own act of creation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearlescent doorway opens not by force but by compassionate alchemy, reweighting the entire premise that only violence can unlock dimensions. Causal chain holds—each stitched tear of light narrows options until the jade tear completes the circuit. Cost is legible in the final sigh of the bulkheads and Elara’s irrevocable solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The recycled ship is not backdrop but antagonist: its groaning plates mirror Elara’s rising grief, its thinning air forces her to the workroom, its final sigh marks release. Micro-setting—the locker, the beams of light, the jade droplet—constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is precise: cold air, crystalline salt, pulsing jade, all filtered through a mender’s tactile bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can grief be transmuted into passage without violence? Pressure tightens as the ship’s gravity of sorrow increases; each luminous stitch is a deliberate trade-off that spends Elara’s finite emotional stamina. The locked dimension is not a place but a frequency—her renunciation of force becomes the only viable tactic, paid for by eternal exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: pacifism as radical repair, extinction as material to be re-stitched rather than avenged. The jade tear’s final placement reweights every prior photograph from relic to raw material. No moral is stated; the pearlescent doorway offers a non-literal answer that lingers in ambiguous hope and irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, and lyrically compressed—“gravitationally lighter when happy” taught early and paid off in the final buoyancy. Syntax mirrors a mender’s patience: long clauses for grief, clipped pulses for stitches. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through Elara’s craft-trained attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “salt lines on the image of a smiling woman she would never know” does triple duty—evokes texture, stakes, and time. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“stitch a new one open”) is minor and contextually earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—pacifist mender transmutes species-wide trauma into literal dimensional key—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric closure that trusts image over spectacle; it pays off. No derivative echoes; the recycled ark, jade tear, and light-stitching feel singular to this voice.</comment>
