<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “heart hammered against her ribs” under pressure. The contradictory impulses (curiosity vs guardianship) act simultaneously in the final beat, and her renunciation to seal the chapel is earned by the preceding discovery. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “shielded openness” label, but it never overrides the concrete choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><<comment>The causal chain (compare films → detect fissure → press stone → enter chapel → seal chapel) is tight, each beat a because/therefore link. Closure is a decisive Earned Stasis: she reseals the stone, incurring the permanent cost of secrecy. The lens holds from first paragraph to last without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, henge stones, and petrified-root chapel are vivid, selective, and constrain every move: the downpour dictates silence, the stone’s fissure is the literal threshold, the root lattice hums with absorbed prayer. Micro-setting (the stone’s shadow angle) becomes the pivot that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—protect the chapel’s silence—is signaled early and tightened once: the moment she chooses to reseal the entrance. The cost is visible on the page: “she sealed the stone entrance once more,” accepting lifelong guardianship. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: the ethics of cartographic silence and the reverence of hidden sanctuaries. The final image—map’s tear left intact, chapel re-hidden—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext hums in the “aggregate of countless whispered prayers” absorbed into the roots.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Diction is precise, tactile, and slightly archaic (“portolan chart,” “cartographers’ knowledge had simply… ceased”) without register drift. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses at the reveal—then settles into the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and exact: “the constant downpour outside sounded like a never-ending sigh.” High information density with clean grammar and no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival film analysis, maritime cartography, and a grown chapel is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The whispered chapel—organic, root-woven, preserved in silence—transforms the familiar “lost sacred space” trope. Risky structural compression (single scene, no dialogue) pays off by heightening the hush.</comment>
