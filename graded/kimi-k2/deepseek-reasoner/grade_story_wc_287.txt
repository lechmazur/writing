<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction between pragmatic usefulness and tender loss is embodied in every tactile choice; the final act of turning the gauge-tooth into a lamp crystallizes her hierarchy of values—growth over nostalgia—at visible emotional cost. No diagnostic speak or stock emotion; sorrow and resolve arrive through soil, moonlight, and the steel’s sliver.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tool’s repurposing redefines “gardening” from living plants to cultivating light, with the moonlit constellation on brick as the on-page cost/benefit ledger. Causal Accumulative lens held; every beat (petal fall, soil ritual, planting metal) tightens the emotional and thematic stakes toward the final image of starred wall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape micro-setting, moonlit harbor, and the gauge-tooth all constrain choices and co-create the final image. Harbor reflection prefigures the splintered starlight that later hits the wall, turning setting into active collaborator rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: reconcile loss of beauty with usable light. Escalation comes solely through a quiet but coherent Accumulative deepening—soil to steel, rose absence to starlight presence. No artificial reversals, just a graceful narrowing of options that earns the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete actions: cultivation shifts from living plants to cultivating literal light. Metaphor never announces itself; it lives inside the gauge-tooth’s transformation. Final image reweights all prior motifs—rose absence, harbor darkness, tool inheritances—without a word of moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical but disciplined, distinct in tactile specificity and rhythmic mimicry of “oars in water.” Free-indirect style folds reflection into present action; moonlit diction never drifts into tourist catalogue nor strays from Elara’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is precise, textured, rhythmically varied; no figurative overload or loops. Line-level density high: “moon caught the metal of the gauge tooth” performs three jobs (atmosphere, character perception, foreshadowing) in eight words.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith tool turned stellar planter; premise feels obvious only in hindsight, and all risk is thematic rather than gimmick. No prior story uses the same inheritance object for literal star-seeding on a fire escape.</comment>
