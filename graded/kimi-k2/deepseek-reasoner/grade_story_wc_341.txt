<comment>The interiority is deeply consistent—every beat is filtered through Aris’s emotional perception lens. The shift from panic to cataloging is embodied and specific, not labeled ("gripped…hands steady"). Final renunciation—abandoning being found for memorializing—earns its cost on the glass of the window and the single whispered “Remembered.”</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: “I had not fallen; I had been gathered up” reweights the inciting loss into cosmic remembrance. The Accumulative/Textural lens accumulates atmospheric emotion until the cadence shift of “after the string broke” crystallizes the reconfiguration. No plot holes, no orientation drift.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Gondola, telescope glass, even the dusty starlight act as micro-setting that charges choices (gripping brass becomes anchor, glass becomes witness). Spatial cues (“small, suspended cabin,” “cold glass”) constrain and reflect internal stakes without white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving emptiness remembers—tightens from drift to renunciation; each cloud-emotion datapoint escalates the texture of loss until the only live option is complete memorializing. Visible cost: surrender of rescue thrill in favor of being the ledger.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific practice: cataloging griefed clouds. Subtext lives in gesture—placing hand on window echoes prior tethered palm on brass. Final whisper “Remembered” offers a resonant, non-moral answer—not rescue but inscription. No overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>POV is stable single interior; syntactic rhythm (long lyrical accumulations broken by sudden short fragments) matches drift then crystallization. Voice is particular—“dusty starlight” filters through meteorologist’s perception without poetic indulgence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dense without overwriting; each line forwards record, atmosphere, or pressure—phrases “quietly explosive,” “profound silence, which was now a chorus” earn their figurative weight. No loops or scaffold; punctuation clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional meteorology with tangible tools. Telescope repurposed as emotional barometer; gondola severance transformed into entry into the “ledger of atmosphere.” Risky inversion of survival trope lands without gimmick, reconfigured by closure image.</comment>
