<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s fully embodied interiority and contradictory impulses are strong, but her decisive moment (“ready to write…”) feels slightly abstract rather than dramatized; thus a hairline slip by the absolute 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain from falcon-silence, to phrasebook clue, to city-sight is tight; the lens holds and the ending crystallizes with felt cost—nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and obsidian lake actively pressure choices and supply the visual closure; the condensation glass and frozen city act as charged micro-settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through silence and unnatural ice without a new external threat; convergence reweights options but lacks an immediate higher-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rivers/source metaphor anchors the thematic question and is recharged in the final discovery, achieving the non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical cadence and perceptual signature; occasional compression and patterned diction pay off at closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Clean, textured prose; a few soft ornamental metaphors (“shadow…a fleeting bruise”) and loops in late paragraphs—minor fog without touching the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>New synthesis between atlas work and frozen metropolis feels inevitable; lyric compression and final image risk create unforgettable specificity.</comment>
