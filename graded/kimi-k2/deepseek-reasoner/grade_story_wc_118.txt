<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers trailing,” “pulse quickened”), but the final shift from collector to healer is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to earn the new mission, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reweights all prior evidence, and the silo’s silence becomes expectant. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact layers density until the axis revelation reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the “terrible new weight” and the fortress-of-thought image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The reclaimed silo is tactile (“metallic tang,” “curved concrete”) and functions as both archive and mausoleum; its bronze quiet constrains Elara’s every move and charges the final image. Micro-setting—the soot-blackened fireplace—delivers the pivotal object, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost memory—tightens when the tapestry proves the axis shift real. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals; the cost is the unbearable knowledge that humanity stopped dreaming. One clear deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective amnesia emerges organically from diary fragments and tapestry; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image—books as neurons in a sleeping brain—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise without explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm (“bronze quiet… not a silence of absence, but of containment”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara’s synesthetic sensitivity colors every observation. No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“catatonia of the soul”) is earned by context. No loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The axis-shift premise is fresh, treated as literal geological trauma rather than metaphor. Dragons as gravitational glyphs, the silo-library as dreaming brain—specific synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky cosmic scale is grounded in tactile detail, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
