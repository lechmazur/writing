<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her “pull in her bones” toward dissonance feels lived-in. The contradiction between her desire for truth and the sorrow she uncovers is dramatized through the tactile handling of the sundial and the micro-choice to read the notes. The final Earned Stasis—accepting the melancholy truth without ornamentation—carries visible emotional cost. Minor: the lover’s death is only summarized, not embodied, so the clockmaker’s grief remains second-hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the legend is not debunked but reweighted by the notes, and Elara’s stance toward her own seeking crystallizes with quiet cost. Causal chain is tight: salvage → sundial → notes → reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; the twilight canal anchors by ~60 words. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural lens holds to the final charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Canal, narrowboat, and sundial are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (cold water, bruised-purple light). The sundial evolves from salvage object to key that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (cabin lamplight) charges the final image. Minor: the town itself remains off-page, slightly blurring social context.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightened once when the notes reveal the lover’s death. Agency is Elara’s deliberate salvage and reading; the cost is the emotional weight of the truth. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: grief mislabeled as madness, truth salvaged from silence. Subtext operates in the sundial’s silent testimony and Elara’s quiet acceptance. Final image—sitting in the dark with the first birds—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; the question of how lies calcify is answered by the clockmaker’s notes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; diction is precise and rhythmic (“bruised purple,” “moss-eaten retaining wall”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Final paragraph modulates into quieter cadence that mirrors Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are concrete and coherent (“sheet of bruised purple”). Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Minor: one near-repeat of “quiet” in adjacent sentences, but it does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-for-truth frame is refreshed by the clockmaker’s precise grief and the sundial’s hidden notes. Specificity of the canal and the object’s engraving anchors universals. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if transplanted wholesale. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
