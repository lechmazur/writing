<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—safety of transcription vs. dormant creator—drives every micro-choice; the moment she touches the gear embodies cost and re-opens a foreclosed path. Reflection stays anchored in present sensory cues and alters tactics. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Closure choice is earned and carries visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—silence accumulates as pattern break until the single cadence shift (gear turn) reweights stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the chord releases held sound and reconfigures Elara’s stance with felt cost (“making peace not with failure, but with a dream”). Orientation clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting (guild hall, crystal forecourt, brass bear) is filtered through Elara’s precise, tactile attention; each object constrains or enables her final choice. Crystal sculptures and petrichor return in the closing image, reweighted by the restored symphony. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive or abandon the dream—is signaled early. Escalation is the tightening silence that forces a single decisive act; cost is the emotional risk of restarting creation. No external reversals, but the silence itself is coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of second chances emerges from concrete particulars (frozen gears, dormant bear, petrichor memory) without moralizing. Final image reweights earlier abandonment into renewal; ambiguity lingers in “music” replacing mere noise. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, precise, slightly archaic—perfect for an introverted horologist. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses under pressure (“smallest, bravest push”). No dialogue; perceptual signature remains consistent. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory detail woven through action; no overwriting in peak beat. Opening and closing lines resonate without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time frozen by an abandoned automaton that literally absorbs all sound until its creator returns. Brass bear as comfort-automaton subverts threat trope. Specificity of horological craft and petrichor nostalgia make premise irreplaceable. Risky stillness sustained without gimmickry.</comment>
