<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “singular and strange” motivation to teach dust to speak is embodied in nightly micro-choices (cloaking the window, sifting dust). The contradiction between her public obedience and private rebellion is shown, not told. The final shift from “teacher” to “conduit” is earned by her listening action and carries felt cost: she now bears the burden of perpetual translation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust’s song is heard, the method proven, the famine’s silence cracked. Causal chain holds: pirate’s clue → listening to silence → hearing dust → writing. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift. Cost is legible in the closing image—her nightly vigil now endless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ember alcove, candle, mist, and radio dial are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the dial’s green glow becomes a “secretly luminous sun” that charges the final image. Micro-setting (desk, dust on sill) constrains every move. Weather and darkness exert pressure, guiding the need for secrecy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the story famine—tightens through one decisive escalation: the broadcaster’s sign-off redefines Elara’s task from teaching to listening. Agency is hers; the cost is the lifelong labor of transcription. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory and narrative survive not through grand gestures but attentive listening. Subtext lives in the silence between notes and the dust’s unheard song. Final image of “grain at a time” offers a non-literal, resonant answer—restoration through humble, continuous acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—“thistled calm,” “ember alcove,” “secretly luminous dial.” Syntax modulates with tension. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and musical; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no filler. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“thistled calm,” “dust singing.” Rhythm accelerates during discovery, then settles into quiet cadence at closure. Zero line-level artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of dust-as-archive and pirate-radio-as-memory is fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric mode commits fully and succeeds. Familiar dystopia is transformed through intimate scale and sensory specificity. Final reconfiguration feels both surprising and predestined.</comment>
