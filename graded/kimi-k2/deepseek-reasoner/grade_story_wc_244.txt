<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s jocular mask and buried ache are shown through crisp, embodied beats; the moon-rock transfer and rumor-engine pivot feel earned because her prior isolation is dramatized, not declared. The final choice to “distribute grace” costs her her anonymity—visible price on the page—yet the interior contradiction between logistician control and emotional exposure could be pushed one notch sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: astronomer’s gift → Elara’s rumor → queue of stories → communal awe that reweights her loneliness. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she had finally stopped moving” crystallizes the new equilibrium with undeniable emotional cost. No orientation drift; ivy-choked depot anchors by word 50 and the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled station is not backdrop but tool: spilled pallets become pews, moon rock a sacrament. Sensory triage—damp earth, rust-flake scent—filters through Elara’s disaster-trained eye, guiding her improvised ritual. Final image of creeping green ceiling literalizes the organic network she’s grown, charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cure for her own loneliness—tightens when the rock forces a public role that threatens her ghost status. One meaningful escalation: private grief → public conduit; the queue forms because she risks exposure. Cost is legible: she forfeits invisibility to become “stationary,” a price named on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: isolation eased not by aid pallets but by shared cosmic wonder. Subtext lives in gesture—rock passed hand to hand—never sermonized. Final image reconfigures the depot from ruin to secular shrine, reweighting earlier “polite anarchy” as sacred communitas without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature sharp—logistics jargon juxtaposed with cosmic yearning. Rhythm modulates: staccato inventory jokes under stress lengthen into hushed reverence at rock transfers. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice coherence survives the tonal pivot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “laughter a sharp, bright thing against the pervasive gloom” advances atmosphere and character in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language spikes only at pressure points (moon fragment = “piece of the profound”) and pays off. Clean grammar, varied paragraph cadence, final line recharges opening “ghost” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “found object heals community” trope by weaponizing disaster-logistics chaos as liturgy; rumor-chain mechanics literalize the story’s own narrative propagation. Moon rock’s redefinition from scientific curio to emotional sacrament feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in merging aid-depot satire with quiet cosmic awe pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
