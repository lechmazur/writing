<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, embodied precision (“hands never trembling”) and the moment she chooses to sit and absorb the field reveal interior stakes; the final shift from solitary puzzle-solver to participant in communal healing is earned and carries felt cost—she relinquishes sole authorship of the “masterpiece.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photograph’s meaning flips from industrial pride to covenant of repair; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of assembly, then the living field reweights the shards. Cost is the surrender of private triumph to shared stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender field and ruined factory are rendered with selective sensory weight; the stalk tip in the photograph physically constrains the final placement and reconfigures the panorama, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; scent lingers like “benevolent ghost,” charging exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute pain into masterpiece—tightens when the missing shard forces Elara to the ruins; the act of lingering reframes the stake from personal completion to communal continuation. One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from juxtaposition of monochrome past and living purple; no explicit moralizing. Final image of townsfolk pointing at the lavender sliver offers resonant, non-literal answer: restoration is ongoing, never finished.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“subtle puzzle archivist,” “earnest whimsy”) is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—calm focus in studio, hushed awe in field. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“vines climb a broken brick wall”) are precise and integrated. Final cadence shift—“As vines climb, so does hope”—earns its lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival puzzle meets living memorial; industrial ruin reclaimed by lavender feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in quiet, non-causal structure pays off via accumulative resonance. No derivative echoes.</comment>
