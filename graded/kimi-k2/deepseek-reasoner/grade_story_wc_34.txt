<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trapped, silent thing” and “tinkersong wonder” are embodied—but her contradictory impulses (sing vs. silence) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final note she sings lands as earned closure, yet the ghost’s agency overshadows hers, muting her personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the graffiti call → courtyard interface → encoding arc is causally tight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s stabilization and Elara’s reclaimed voice carry visible cost in the “silent, expanding ring of pure color.” No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early; the flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting that constrains the encoding action. Sensory detail is selective—cold iron, damp stone, blue light—filtered through Elara’s urgency. Final shimmering murals evolve from the mist, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give voice to the ghost and herself—tightens when Elara realizes the encoding will cost her last silence. One meaningful deepening: her kinship with the ghost turns abstract empathy into concrete sacrifice. Lightning/thunder beat crystallizes the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of mutual recognition emerges from encoded graffiti and mirrored loneliness; no explicit statement. Final image of city lights “twinkling like answers” reweights the premise: articulation is reciprocal. Subtext in the ghost’s “beautiful, broken symphony” lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder.” Syntax modulates with tension: longer lyrical lines collapse into swift encoding verbs. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; “tinkersong wonder” and “ghost in code” are fresh coinages. Occasional elevated diction (“articulate unspoken needs”) edges toward register drift but stays within Elara’s artistic lexicon. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Digital-ghost-as-musical-score is a non-obvious synthesis; the graffiti interface and flower-press encoding feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “shattered melodies” and “iron etched with geometric patterns” grounds the speculative frame. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure.</comment>
