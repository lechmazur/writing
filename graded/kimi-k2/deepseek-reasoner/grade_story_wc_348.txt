<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied—his grief crystallizes in the chrysalis and loosens in the river foam. The contradiction between rigid polymer grief and fluid braid insight is dramatized, not told. Micro-choice of releasing the chrysalis crystallizes the shift with visible cost. One notch below 9 because the sister’s absence is off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis release reweights the entire grief premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—foam insight → loosened grief → integrated forward motion. Cost is legible in the final image: “not an act of letting go, but of integration.” No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The braided ravine and foam patterns are not backdrop; they supply the very metaphor that reconfigures grief. Micro-setting of the chrysalis in hand constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is chemist-biased: surfactant talk, colloidal dispersion. One hairline slip: “distant town” is generic, but it never guides choice, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens once via foam insight that reframes grief from failure to process. Escalation is accretive: foam → chrysalis → release. Cost is felt in the shift from “unbreakable chain” to “braid,” foreclosing isolation as viable stance. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: foam, chrysalis, polymer science. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally—integration without moralizing. No late thesis statement; resonance arises from reweighted objects. Complexity preserved: grief remains, but its structure changes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is chemist-symphonic: layered auditory metaphors, precise technical diction, rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—river as fugue, foam as colloid. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he saw how…”) but forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—foam lace, polymer grief. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest. One near-mixed metaphor (“symphony after a key change”) but it lands cleanly in context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: polymer chemistry + musical perception + grief ecology. Trope of “letting go” is subverted into integration. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Not quite 9+ because the sister-vanish premise is familiar, though transformed by specificity.</comment>
