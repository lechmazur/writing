<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. impermanence—are embodied in the micro-choice to release the ash rather than seal it. Her interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with filial grief; the final smile carries visible cost of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the slow build of ash → image → dissolution is a single cadence shift that reweights the stake from capture to release. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dust settling on the chair legs crystallizes the cost of impermanence with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The gallery’s white panel, the mask’s cracks, and the rocking chair’s final stillness are micro-settings that constrain every gesture and charge the ending. Each object is handled, tracked, and transformed; their states alter tactics and final meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture a fleeting emotion—tightens once: the child’s sneeze dissolves the image, forcing Elara to accept impermanence. The cost is the literal loss of the portrait; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ash itself: beauty is the act of witnessing, not the artifact. The final swirl of dust reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of permanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—charcoal grit, resin seams, the hush of ash. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. The final image’s quiet cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory detail or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The dissolution beat is rendered with crystalline clarity: “the careful lines of ash softened, blurred, and then lifted.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ash-as-memory medium, the mask-as-stencil, and the sneeze-as-dissolver synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking (non-causal, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
