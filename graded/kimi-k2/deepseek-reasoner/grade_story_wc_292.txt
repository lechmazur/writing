<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and embodied tension are crisply present, yet her interior contradiction—nervous vs confident—remains more labeled than dramatized under pressure. The renunciation feels earned, but the moment of visible cost comes only in the spectral salute rather than a harder forfeiture she must carry. Minor drift into stock emotional summary (“profound, aching peace”) softens the interior specificity in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ancestor’s Resonant Reconfiguration and perceptible peace create a felt before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causality from copper nail to restored name is explicit, and the final wind-scour image reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation and lens are stable; no breaks at pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The station’s “overgrown sensor arrays,” headstone’s “verdigris light,” and stagnant air constrain Elara’s movements and mood. Specificity in spatial choreography and object handling remains coherent, tracking nail and spade with clarity. One missed chance: the final “clean wind” is only mildly reweighted against earlier spongey dread rather than fully integrated into the restoration metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—justice for her ancestor—propels every beat; tension escalates from deciphering journals to physically retrieving the nail. The cost surfaces in Elara’s shaken hands and the coffin violation; a visible price for the lineage debt is paid. The climax choice is crystallized but slightly cushioned—no irrevocable option is foreclosed to Elara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, historical truth, and repair emerge organically through actions and objects (maps, journals, nail). Subtext is carried in Elara’s tactile reverence: fingers tracing coastlines, apology embedded in every scoop of earth. Final image of the wind offers quiet resonance rather than overt moral; ambiguity lingers just enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice stays consistent and textured: verbs like “spongey dread,” “rot-mottled,” and “verdigris light” filter through an archivist’s careful perceptual signature. Syntax tightens during exhumation—short, unsparing clauses—mirroring physical strain. Occasional faint drift into elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts out of focalizer lexicon but quickly recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dense, purposeful prose moves nimbly from atmospheric decay to ritual retrieval without padding. Only one minor scaffold—repetition of “nervously confident” twice in quick succession—flashes briefly. Overall, clarity, propulsion, and read-aloud rhythm hold with only nanoscopic slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as a folkloric mechanism is made specific through nautical journals and metallurgical ritual—the fresh inflection needed to transcend trope. The climate-collapse backdrop deepens rather than distracts. Minor deduction for a conceptual overlap with other climate-ghost subgenres, but the personal archaeological angle keeps it distinct.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s professional identity and ethical imperative shape every choice: from deciphering stanzas to digging outside official grounds. Integrates setup, middle tactics, and closure linkage.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The nail surfaces early, charged as talisman, handled in coffin retrieval, and finally reweighted from symbolic prison key to freed identity.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Not a side premise—reversible exile is the entire mechanism; Elara must master it, test it, and enact it using personal and historical stakes.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shown in trembling spade vs bold declaration; the tension directly shapes the burial exhumation sequence.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Questioning the official record drives the entire narrative engine; every beat is a forensic question of inherited truth.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hidden chemical formulae in pentameter function both as clue and ritual script; they are decoded, tested, and spoken aloud in the reversal act.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Station grounds provide location and a perimeter, but minimal atmospheric integration; wind shift at end could have been any site.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Unnatural humidity and stalled fronts intensify Elara’s urgency and the sense of historical wrong lingering into present, but not clock-tight.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Desire is active, embodied: every page turn and spade stab traces loyalty to ancestor; the cost is both narrative and ethical.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Spongey dread saturates early action, then modulates into relief as the spirit resolves; tone shift is coherent and charges the closure.</question>
