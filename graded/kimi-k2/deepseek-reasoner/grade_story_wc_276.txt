<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s cool-headedness is embodied in micro-choices (zigzag path, steady breath) and contradicted by the private ache he absorbs from the goddess’s echo; the final renunciation—accepting her sorrow into silence—costs him the garden’s old song and is earned by every prior beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rail spike’s warm silence reweights the premise, proving the method worked. Causal chain—zigzag path → constellations freeze → silence offered → echo captured—holds without gaps; cost is the garden’s tonal shift and Kaelen’s permanent burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not backdrop but active antagonist: blossoms shatter under wrong steps, violet fog thickens resistance, and the final tonal shift confirms the setting’s agency. Spatial choreography is exact; the rail spike’s final warmth charges the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the echo—tightens when the constellations freeze and the garden’s hum stops; Kaelen’s agency (pouring will into silence) is the only resolution. Cost is palpable: the garden’s loneliness lifts, but he now carries the goddess’s grief in iron.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as deeper receptivity emerges through action, not statement; the final warm spike answers the opening dream without moralizing. The feral lullaby modulates from threat to lull, reconfiguring meaning through embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is cool, tactile, and musically precise—“felt it in his teeth,” “shimmering, concentric rings.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“a moth resisting a flame”—then settles into the final soft sigh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of fishing, iron spike, and audible light is utterly fresh; the goddess-echo conceit is transformed through Kaelen’s specific silence. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
