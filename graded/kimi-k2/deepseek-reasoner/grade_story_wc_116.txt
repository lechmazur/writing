<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Keeper’s interiority is vivid—his “loose grip on reality” and “regenerative silence” are embodied in the swan-folding ritual and the final re-folding. Motivation to witness without judgment is dramatized when he refuses to erase the knot of pain, letting it dissipate through pure observation. The cost is felt in the shattering of his habitual stillness and the labor of re-folding a new swan. One notch below 9 because the contradiction between passive witness and active burrower is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the groan subsides, the library’s slow decay resumes, and the Keeper re-enters Earned Stasis with a fresh swan. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each fold thickens the silence until observation itself dissolves the knot. The cost is legible in the final image: “a fresh sheet of paper,” the price of renewed vigilance. Minor slip: the transition into the vibrational realm is slightly under-cued.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and river are rendered with tactile decay—“vine than wood,” “black water churning”—and constrain every move: the refuge is the only portal, the river mirrors the groan’s intensity. The obsidian walls become “insubstantial” at the threshold beat, charging the final return to solidity. One sensory layer (smell) is under-used, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the library’s slow decay by witnessing the source of collapse. Escalation is a single deepening—the groan intensifies until the Keeper must act, then subsides when he refrains from fixing. Cost is the psychic rupture of his silence and the labor of a new chronicle. Agency is subtle (observation as action) but sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: change is not to be arrested but witnessed, and in that witnessing lies a regenerative quiet. The final re-folding of the swan reweights the opening image of decay into a cycle of renewal. No moralizing—just the charged poise of “eternal, silent life.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lapidary, with a perceptual signature attuned to entropy—“stone wept dust,” “knowledge dissolved into mud.” Syntax modulates from long, vine-like sentences to clipped folds. No dialogue, but the prose itself performs the regenerative silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated; every image does double duty. No loops or scaffold, only one mixed metaphor (“vine than wood” edges toward excess). Rhythm accelerates during the vibrational descent, then exhales into stillness. A single typo-level slip (“etched patience into his very soul” could be crisper) keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The origami-swan-as-reality-key is a fresh, non-obvious mechanism; the library that decays into knowledge-mud feels newly mythic. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final re-folding. No derivative echoes; the synthesis of entropy-witnessing and origami cartography is singular.</comment>
