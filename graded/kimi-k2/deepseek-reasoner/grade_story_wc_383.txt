<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from pragmatic skeptic to haunted believer is earned through tactile sensory friction—not a bolt-from-the-blue epiphany but a forced surrender to what her hands feel and cannot fix. The contradiction plays out: her lifelong comfort in mending things becomes the very trap as the shell “holds her fast” not with glue but neural resonance. Cost is legible: her dawn exhaustion, the shell now emptied, and her altered sense of self (“so did she”). Minor slip—interior voice drifts toward therapeutic abstraction, e.g., “profound, aching loneliness,” slightly softening rawness. Otherwise interior stakes tighten neatly to closure. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a clear causal lens: because the shell traps terror it forces Elara to try harmonics; her failures therefore narrow options; one correct frequency finally reweights the memory into release. Closure is on-page: a visible light-pulse and audible sigh mark before/after, while emotional cost lingers in the dawn hush. Orientation occurs within 55 words, stakes escalate cleanly; no telegraphing beyond the page. At 9+ gate it lands with cost without breaking coherence. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The velvet garden is no decorative backdrop; the night-blooming jasmine, tide salt, and failing starlight all constrain her workspace and signal elapsed time. Micro-setting (the shell, tuning forks) doubles as tool and setting, literally vibrating against her ribs to guide pacing. No drift in spatial or temporal anchors. Environment guides choices—she must finish “before the last star fades”—without scenic bloat. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake (freeing a sealed consciousness) announced within first two paragraphs; escalation compresses via dwindling night and tightening sonic failures. Each failed fork creates a live cost: exposure to unfiltered terror. Final harmonic renders the prison untenable—the option to “save” the shell is foreclosed by the act itself (the once-glow goes dark). Agency remains hers; luck complicates merely by providing one resonance among infinite possibilities rather than handing her a turnkey solution. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>The question “how do we translate isolation into independence” emerges organically through action rather than authorial statement. Thematic threads—repair vs release, preservation vs letting go—are braided into physical stakes: a mended object becomes an unfix memory relic. Final image (dark but “lighter”) leaves room for divergent readings without preaching. Slight tonal lift at closure edges close to CR, though ambiguity borders on too gentle for full 9-point punch. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Sensuous, slightly elevated cadence fits the hyper-attentive eye of a restorer, and syntax contracts under mounting pressure (“a single, mournful note”). Word choice (“quarantined memory,” “crystalline form”) remains within conceivable lexicon of an artisan steeped in materials. Filter verbs kept minimal; perceptual signature consistent (night-blooming jasmine, tidal musk read as Elara’s filter). No head-hops; compression across starlight-to-dawn transition remains legible. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sentences do double work: “humid velvet garden” compresses temperature, texture, and spatial limits. No syntactic loops; varied sentence lengths mirror calm-slow then urgent-beat pacing. One mild scaffold—“breaking apart on a reef in a storm”—is functional, not drag. Diction precise: crystalline/chorister/f-sharp feel artisan-specific rather than thesauric. One metaphor cluster around “radiant smile swallowed” slightly mingles, but clarity holds. Closure beats are clean and tactile. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>The core trope of memory-haunted artefact is refreshed by literal crystalline resonance tech rather than mystical hand-wavium. Fresh hinge: a restorer’s craft becomes both trap and key—she must use her profession against itself. Final quiet fade is risk-taking in an age of blazing climaxes yet feels thematically inevitable. Small echo-potential with any ‘memory trapped in object’ tale remains, preventing higher band. </comment>
