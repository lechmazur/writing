<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “calloused yet gentle” hands and the moment she feels the cost in Kaelen’s eyes crystallize her contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—accepting a scarred peace—earns its cost through prior grief. Minor slip: “operatively gentle” reads like a dossier label rather than lived texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice of starfire dissolves into sparks that reconfigure the future without tidy resolution. Causal linkage holds—every beat from the clipboard flare to the twin-sun zenith tightens the window and forecloses further war. Cost is legible in the shared sob and the empty clipboard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terrace’s warm flagstones and the valley’s “patchwork of vibrant new growth” anchor place and mood; the twin suns function as a live clock that constrains the final choice. Micro-setting—the clipboard’s constellations—becomes the decisive tool. One minor drift: “ancient terrace” could be any terrace without a sharper sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ratify the accord before the celestial window closes—is signaled early and escalates through the muster ritual. The tightening is single but decisive: the projected schematic solidifies into a seal, foreclosing all future battle plans. Cost is visible in Kaelen’s shuddering breath and Elara’s emptied clipboard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “flawed beauty” emerges from the valley’s scorched earth and the scarred peace; no moral is stated. The final image—sparks falling like warm rain—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: beauty persists because it is imperfect. Subtext in the shared silence after the ritual carries more weight than any declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature shows in Elara’s selective noticing of celestial drift and the “stubborn” new growth. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the zenith, longer breaths afterward. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized through Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“lattice of truce written in starfire”) are precise. One elevated phrase—“compound interest of grief”—skims purple but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ritual-astronomy peace accord feels fresh; the clipboard as key rather than note-taker transforms a mundane prop into mythic engine. Synthesis of celestial mechanics and emotional cost is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet, anti-cathartic ending heightens resonance.</comment>
