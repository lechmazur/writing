<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, the “archivist of ruin” stance—yet the shift from despair to synthesis is slightly under-motivated; the cost of her new stance is implied rather than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the fall-through-star crystallizes the new stance with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each collage choice thickens the pattern until the last splice reweights the whole. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is more than backdrop—its constricting walls and perpetual twilight exert literal pressure that subsides only after the collage act. The broken tarot cards function as micro-setting, their fragments steering every choice. One step short of 9 because the lantern itself never constrains action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether fragmented self can be reassembled—tightens once when collage becomes the only tactic against suffocation. The cost is the acceptance of permanent fracture, visible in the final splice. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: wholeness is a designed mosaic, not a restoration. The Tower/Star splice offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior fragment without moralizing. Subtext resides in the act, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and consistent—“luminescent ache,” “radiance that absorbed their terror.” Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“threads of despair,” “woven into something stronger”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift toward the lyrical is voice-motivated and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The tarot-collage premise feels inevitable yet fresh; the transformation of broken prophecy into self-authored myth is specific to Elara’s painterly lens. Risky structure—lyric accumulative collage—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
