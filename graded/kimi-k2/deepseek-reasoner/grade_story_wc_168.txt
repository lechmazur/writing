<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scar, the ash, the porcelain box all press against her contradictory impulses. The bargain of innocence for life is dramatized through her micro-choice to release the ashes, not merely stated. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Only a slight over-articulation of “translate pain into universal language” nicks the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: arrival → opening box → releasing ashes → earned stasis. Orientation is immediate; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she forecloses the path of self-absolution and accepts perpetual witness. The porcelain box and moonlit ridge function as persistent constraints. Cost is legible in the final image of empty box and full heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The moonlit ridge, cold ash scent, and granite’s retained warmth anchor place and mood. The porcelain box operates as micro-setting that constrains her gesture. Sensory selection is filtered through firefighter priorities—smoke, ash, cool porcelain. Environment subtly guides the final release of ashes to the wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate private guilt into bearable memory—is signaled early and tightened by the act of scattering. Agency is renunciation, not rescue; the tightening narrows her options from saving to witnessing. Cost is the irreversible dispersal of the last relic. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ashes: the impossibility of redemption versus the necessity of witness. Subtext lives in the silence and the wind’s acceptance of ash. Final image reweights the premise—salvation is not erasure but translation. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the empty box.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s scarred sensorium; perceptual signature is tactile and fire-forged. Syntax mirrors her careful, deliberate movements—“gently skilled,” “soft sigh.” No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on internal texture alone, which remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or interior pressure. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“hard softness,” “stone in her chest.” Final cadence slows to match the scattering beats. Minor elevation in diction (“celestial bodies”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-ritual is transformed through firefighter specificity and the porcelain box’s history. The bargain of innocence for life reframes survivor guilt without melodrama. Fresh angle: salvation as translation, not absolution. Slight risk in quiet ending pays off via charged image.</comment>
