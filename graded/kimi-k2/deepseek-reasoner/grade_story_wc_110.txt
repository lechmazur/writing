<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—silent guilt vs. active redress—plays in scene: pocketing the lens, tracing the concert ticket. Her interior oscillation and the decisive final gesture of placing-lens-over-doodle crystallize character change with felt relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal arc locks: taking the lens (inciting) → decoding doodles through lens → silent display (climax). Closure—Leo’s eyes thawing under the glass—lands with cost and single-scene tightness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-washed plaza is more than backdrop; its lens-crystal sculptures mirror literal projector lenses, subtly guiding the final act of lens-over-object. Micro-settings (bench, wet marble) pressure on-the-page tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mistrust—intensifies when the lens turns hurts into palpable evidence. One meaningful escalation: decoding + silent revelation forces stance crystallization and thaws Leo’s eyes with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as liberation emerges from the doodle hornet and the brothers’ past pain, paid off in the lens moment. Final image—eyes thawing—non-literally answers the “how do we fix silence?” question without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice—clinical archive registrar meets muted emotional color. Poetic compression (“cold weight…glistening under lamps”) taught early and paid off in final hush. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Clean, dense lines advance either plot or atmosphere every sentence; figurative language mirrors lens distortion without clutter. Zero loops or scaffold; final image is crystalline without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Combines micro-setting and object-as-medium in a fresh way; the lens-as-confessional is a non-obvious reinvention of the apology trope, synthesizing sets the brothers’ shared memory into tangible guilt via hornet doodles.</comment>
