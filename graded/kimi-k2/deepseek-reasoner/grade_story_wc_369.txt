<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—his invented unit “7.3 grays of sorrow” is a character-defining tic that later dissolves under pressure. The micro-choice to raise the sextant toward the oaks rather than the sky crystallizes his shift from maintenance to restoration. Cost is felt: he forfeits the directive to deconstruct, embracing an uncharted vocation. One slip: the jump from 7.3 to 7.4 grays is reported rather than dramatized in body or action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended sextant reweights the premise, turning quantified sorrow into participatory memory. Causal chain holds—storm → tower → book → moonlight → sextant activation—each beat narrowing Silas’s options until the final stance crystallizes. The pin-drop beat functions as a taught micro-turn that focuses the magical act. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail—“mossy stones,” “ozone,” “violent flashes”—grounds the labyrinth and tower without catalog bloat. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting, its brass gleam constraining the final choice. Weather and moonlight are not backdrop but causal agents. One hedge: the western quadrant remains a vague spatial marker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve living memory versus obey demolition order—tightens once when the directive arrives and again when the storm forces trespass. Escalation is situational: external pressure (storm, moonbeam) complicates but does not resolve; Silas’s agency crystallizes in the final stance. Cost is legible: he risks disobedience and an unknown future. No redundant reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: individual sorrow gains meaning only when woven into collective memory. The arboreal witness concept reweights the sextant from broken tool to conduit of communal history. Final image—man, tower, mended instrument—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, precise, and consistent with a quiet laborer’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short clauses under storm pressure, longer reflective cadences in calm. No dialogue, so no register clash. The invented “grays” unit and the tactile description of the sextant create a distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“sorrow…polished smooth by routine.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he watched, stunned”) is acceptable under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantified sorrow, arboreal memory, and a moon-healed sextant feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The mundane-miracle tone is sustained without gimmickry. Risky compression—stormlit tower, magical repair, dream-mapping—lands coherent under the situational lens. No derivative echoes.</comment>
