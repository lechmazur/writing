<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s regret and the “confidently uncertain” trait are embodied in his obsessive decoding and the tremor when the anomaly mirrors his mistake. The pen’s insertion is a micro-choice that crystallizes his shift from shame to acceptance, but the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he understood then”) rather than sustained contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: anomaly’s signal → decoded question → pen insertion → stabilized anomaly. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reframes the lichen error as necessary key; cost is the irreversibility of the terraforming loss. One minor ellipsis: how the pen’s nib fits the port is left to wonder, but the beat lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The station’s flicker, gravitational “humming,” and the anomaly’s distortions are vivid and selective. The pen’s cool barrel and the console’s click anchor the final action. Environment constrains the climax: only the anomaly’s shear allows the message storage and the pen’s calibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming the Kepler failure—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the anomaly’s message reframes the lichen from catastrophe to catalyst. Agency is the pen insertion that forecloses further self-recrimination; cost is the irreversible ecological damage now accepted as phase one.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “error as hidden design” emerges organically from the lichen–anomaly link. Subtext lives in the useless pen becoming the corrective key. Final image of “learning how to ask the right questions” avoids moralizing and lets the reweighted past resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly academic, matching a signal interpreter’s diction. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences collapse into clipped beats at the insertion. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Occasional elevated phrasing (“cosmic noise,” “conceptual repricing”) is earned by the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, high-density, with only one soft loop (“strange comfort” twice in closing). Metaphors are controlled: “ghost of his mistake” is brief and apt. No filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph’s cadence shift to a single crystallizing sentence works.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The terraforming lichen reimagined as gravitational key is a fresh synthesis. The mentor’s posthumous message stored in spacetime shear feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk is taken with the pen’s sudden mechanical fit, but the story commits fully and lands the reconfiguration.</comment>
