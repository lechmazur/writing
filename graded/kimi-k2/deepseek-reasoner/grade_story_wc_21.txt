<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s scholarly compulsion and embodied shock after the retrocognitive seizure are vivid and specific; interior contradiction surfaces when reverence for truth collides with fear of re-entry. The final covenant—transcribing her words—feels earned by his earlier physical willingness to brave the sentinel, anchoring growth with visible cost. No secondary on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested; single POV holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure unit: Conceptual Repricing as the diary becomes “a testament ratified by the land,” reweighting historical narrative with on-page social cost. Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the pattern of artifact → memory → landscape dialogue builds density that crystallizes in the final image. One transition zeppelin-to-beach is clean; orientation anchored in first 60 words. Causality intact: each beat (find diary → triggered seizure → decode coordinates → beach dialog) sequences via pressure. Cost is legible in the sentence “a quiet victory wrested from the echoes of violence.” Meets closure gate; perceptual time warp is taught early and pays off at ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Pressurized hush” of the zeppelin gondola and “obsidian lagoon… reflecting nothing” are selective, sensory, and tied to POV priorities. The lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: Elias must approach it to witness the past. Driftwood messages track Spar across beats; spatial choreography of beach debris is precise. World rules (sentinel as memory echo) stay consistent via dramatized cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth versus risk of psychic dissolution—is signaled early. Micro-turn at the beach: parley with sentinel narrows choice from passive retrieval to active reparative dialogue; stakes tighten when spectral sentinel escalates from guard to witness to consenter. No coincidence resolves. Final cost: accepting custodianship of her silenced truth, foreclosing Elias’s prior neutrality. Visible price. Lens-supported escalation sufficient at 680 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme that official history is dangerously incomplete emerges through diary, lagoon vision, and Elara’s clandestine tactics, never asserted. Subtext in aura-of-fear sentinel: trauma as living archive must be negotiated, not conquered. Final reweighting: truth is not merely retrieved but ceremonially safeguarded—earned insight via embodied risk. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity of who took Elara persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is somber, precise, book-scented—consistent with scholarly archivist POV. Compression in “quiet thunderclap” and internal metaphor modulation under retrocognitive stress feel intentional. No dialogue; third-person close-limited stays locked, no head-hop. Rhythm breathes during library stillness and tightens on the beach without lapsing into template. Perceptual signature sharp in use of aged paper/ozone and heat-shimmer sentinel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies, density high. No paraphrase loops observed; “smelled of aged paper and ozone” does one job of place-scent-characterization. Figurative muddle absent; “bleached coin” is deft, singular, and refracts off the obsidian’s null reflection. No filter-verb clusters or elevated-register drift. Micro-punctuation decisions support pressure beat. Clean mechanics; zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Retrocognitive zeppelin library is fresh synthesis. Encrypted diary → memory trap → landscape testimony reads inevitable in hindsight. Major risk paid: non-corporeal antagonist as trauma guardian, not caricature. Specific detail (Baldwin first edition as hiding place) personalizes tropes without ornament. Premise could not run with renamed parts; obsidian lagoon is unique to story logic and charges closure.</comment>
