<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her needle as “tiny conductor,” the candle’s cold light revealing thread secrets—but her contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to risk ridicule at the gate is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost. Secondary characters (young guard) apply pressure that alters the state of the relationship in one beat. Minor slip: “galaxy-chart embroiderer” is label-heavy; the work itself shows the vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the gate seals, coup collapses, Astrologer’s plot exposed—cost is the public branding of Elara as madwoman and the candle’s fragility. Causal chain holds: embroidered map → hidden warning → guard’s alarm → gate closure. One transition (observatory → city → gate) is legible. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 80 words. Minor ellipsis in how the guard instantly translates embroidery is smoothed by “impeccable, terrifying map.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt Observatory’s rust-gold decay and the candle’s cold light constrain choices: the former isolates Elara, the latter enables hidden-thread reading. Micro-setting (workbench, gate) tracks spatially; no impossible positions. Weather (“autumn had painted”) mirrors internal tension without overt symbolism. Tool-as-setting (tapestry) literally becomes the city map that alters tactics. One anachronism risk—“weaponized asteroid” feels SF in ostensibly low-tech world—but the Astrologer’s sky-editing justifies it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent false-flag catastrophe—signaled early. Pressure tightens via embroidered revelation; each stitch narrows options until only Western Gate path remains. Agency: Elara’s decision to wear tapestry as disguise forces confrontation with guards. Cost is social humiliation and potential torching of her life’s work. Coincidence (young guard’s insight) complicates but does not resolve; the map’s clarity earns the reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth hidden in dismissed art—emerges through concrete events: embroidery dismissed as decoration becomes the key to salvation. Subtext in “madwoman muttering about threads” versus actual strategic genius. Final image of “new silence… of awe” reweights earlier “echoed silence” without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (threads, candle, sky) loops back to core question of who gets to name reality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: needle as conductor, silk “straining against anchors.” No head-hopping. Diction poetic yet precise—“phosphorescence within the fiber” is sensuous and character-bound. Compression in final paragraph (“slipped through… anxious city”) is strategic. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: guards’ laughter → younger guard’s “absolute certainty” conveyed through action, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“palace for a silent, decaying science”) serve atmosphere without clutter. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension—long lyrical lines in observatory, staccato beats during escape. One mixed metaphor risk: “threads cut by a needle” is literal and figurative simultaneously, but context justifies. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs anchor action.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—embroidery as astrophysical espionage—is fresh synthesis of craft and cosmology. Trope of “mad seer” is inverted: Elara’s seeming madness is tactical camouflage. Specificity of “adjacent possibilities” method and phosphorescent thread creates irreplaceable texture. Transformation test: story fails if embroidery swapped for any other art. Risky lyric density pays off in closure image.</comment>
