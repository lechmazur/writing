<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority sharp; embodied panic (“knuckles white” “heart frantic drum”) grounds Elara’s transformation from mere sculptor to timewoven chronicler, yet her shift to passive receptor during the alliance vision nudges agency down a tick.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpture’s unveiling charges prior layers (GPS death → lantern → vision → final image) with felt cost, the hum confirming the pact; causal spine intact, no orientation drift, though the leap from slide vision to full commitment is slightly under-joined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tempest, archstone, and turbine-hum constrain every choice and charge the final sculpture; specificity of salt-bleached roots and shingle scrape anchors the world, just missing the gate-capping moment where setting becomes the literal locus of loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve and transmit the archway’s layered truth—tightens after GPS death; stakes rise when slide reveals the price of shared memory, and final sculpture enacts the only viable route, cost visible in the hiker’s “found” tremor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges seamlessly: art as vessel for temporal solidarity, complexity borne on simplicity’s scaffold; avoids statement by letting driftwood knots become faces and hum remain unexplained, offering resonant after-image sans moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice taut, perceptual signature distinct (“turbine-hum reverie” “scrape onto the shingle”); single POV maintained, no head-hop, though occasional lyrical swell edges toward soft-focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm matches storm—short percussive bursts to longer, calmer breaths at the sculpting bench; few scaffold loops, clear propulsion, only faint echo of template stems (“her new” x2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh fusion of maritime microhistory with sculptural palimpsest; slide-lantern as non-obvious seer’s lens transforms familiar “storm refuge” into cross-century council; bold yet lucid.</comment>
