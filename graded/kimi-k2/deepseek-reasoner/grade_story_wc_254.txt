<comment>Elara’s need to dissolve boundaries is visceral—palms sinking into quartz crystallizes motive. Micro-choice at pillar accepts exile’s memories, fuses stone’s endurance with her prior pain; cost (loss of prior rigid identity) registers before closure. However, status dynamics and secondary pressure absent; interiority remains rich yet solitary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a quiet but seismic shift: acceptance of fluid, “boundary-less” voice is dramatized by leaving the page on the floor (Earned Stasis). Causality links the stone’s acceptance of her memories → her decision to paraphrase rather than declare → final renunciation of fixed forms. Cost is conceptual—permanently surrendering former self-definition.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt atrium’s floor and pillars physically constrain gesture—palms against stone, page left beneath colonnade. Frozen lake overhead and glacier form tacit threat felt as weight, recharging final image. Sensory specificity is selective, always filtered through Elara’s perceptual lens rather than catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (sacred dissolution of rigid aesthetic boundaries) announced early. Tightening occurs at pillar contact: the quartz’s yielding forecloses the old self’s insistence on “approved metaphors,” narrowing her to one irreversible act—paraphrase and leave. No extraneous reversals; pressure stays accumulative/textural under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of boundary dissolution emerges from stone’s wordless patience braided with personal exile; final paraphrase renders theme through concrete action, no sermonizing. Tonal restraint deepens resonance—“silent leaf against cobalt” answers question without summary. Some residual lyric abstraction nudges ceiling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression taught early (“lantern-moth hush”) holds pattern to last line’s violet lake. Free indirect motion is clean; no POV drift. Distinct perceptual signature—cloud-shadow noticing, boundary-dissolving method—stays coherent through peak moment leaving page, voice modulates via syntactic breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, minimal loops; every image multi-tasks (“humming quartz” = sound, texture, geological memory). One mixed metaphor (“crystal-mist” moment) is momentary but doesn’t cloud closure. Density high without purple overwrite.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Fusion of geologic memory and human exile is a fresh angle on “poet reclaiming voice,” avoiding cliché triumph. Boundary dissolution as sacred gesture rather than rebellion transforms familiar arc into resonant risk. Minor risk: premise edges elegiac rather than radical, softening originality marginally.</comment>
