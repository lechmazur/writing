<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. absolution—drives every beat; the rake-handle notches embody her guilt and the final renunciation is earned. Embodied emotion (“bent her shoulders,” “cold, sharp-toothed surf”) is specific and non-generic. The only cap is that the father backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page renunciation: she climbs to still the gears, letting time stop. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each notch and tide accrues until the pendulum bob’s arrival breaks the pattern. Cost is palpable in the sudden silence over Selthorne. No causality or orientation slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge and brass pendulum bob are rendered with tactile specificity and directly constrain her final choice; the ridge becomes the monument to fallibility. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: volcanic glass under boots, bruised sky. Micro-setting (rake handle) functions as charged object. One notch from 9+ only because the village itself is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring balance—tightens when the bob appears; escalation is a single, intensifying beat that forces renunciation. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The price is the silence that follows her choice. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absolution vs. shared responsibility emerges organically from the rake notches and the stopped pendulum; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without statement. Subtext in the silence is felt, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, and consistent with a clock-winder’s mind; perceptual signature is strong (“measured ticks and deliberate tocks”). No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and patterned elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“dark mirror,” “anchor in shifting waves”) are apt and unstrained. One minor elevated phrase—“profound dissonance”—slightly above POV lexicon, not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Clock-winder seeking absolution via tidal detritus is a fresh synthesis; the stopped pendulum as monument is an earned, non-gimmicky inversion. Specificity of volcanic glass and brass gives lived texture. Risk in letting time stop pays off with clarity.</comment>
