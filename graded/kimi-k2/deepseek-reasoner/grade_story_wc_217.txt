<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “warmly attentive” trait drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—accepting the broken as whole—earns its cost through prior causality. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kite’s fall → drake’s distress → feather gift tightens pattern and reweights perception. Closure is a Charged Poise: the world “whole once more because she had embraced its lovely cracks” crystallizes cost without tidy resolution. Causality is intact, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet stone scent, salt-pruned pine—details are selective, POV-filtered, and guide action (running path, freeing wing). The feather’s micro-setting constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in the incomplete—escalates through the drake crisis and narrows to the single feather. Cost is felt in the hush after trust is risked. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fracture as mosaic, not flaw. The feather’s “woven dawns” reweights earlier images without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “burnished hush,” “prismatic eye,” syntax mirrors poet’s attention. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; perceptual signature is sharp and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene pulse; final paragraph achieves crystalline cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar rescue arc transformed through lyric attention and refusal of tidy healing. Specificity of “oil-on-water scales” and “single red diamond kite” anchors freshness. Risk lies in quiet closure, paid off by earned resonance.</comment>
