<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. grief—is embodied in the glass-eye ritual and the moment her fingers brush the mosaic; the shift from solving absence to honoring presence is earned and costly, though the brother remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reframes the entire quest from “find zero” to “map the shape of love etched in damage.” Accumulative lens holds—each drip, chip, and beam layers density until the reconfiguration is inevitable and the cost (accepting unsolvable loss) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, and chipped mosaic constrain every move: the water feeds memory, the mosaic records it, and the stone’s fractures literally guide the magical energy; the final image recharges these details as living archive, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quantify emotion to locate brother—tightens when the glass eyes yield only “hollow zero,” forcing a deepening shift to quantifying love instead; the cost is the irreversible acceptance that return is impossible, paid on the page in her slumped posture and recalibrated purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief’s geometry is the record of shared moments etched in damage; the final reweighting—absence as part of the formula, not its failure—offers resonant non-literal answer and invites lingering reflection on love’s measurable residue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and character-bound; sensory diction (“plink-plink,” “waxy leaves,” “hollow zero”) stays within Elara’s lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure compresses during the ritual and breathes in the final recalibration, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: every sentence advances image or stakes; no loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is selective (“shimmering thread,” “soil of her grief”) and never muddies causality; final cadence shift is earned and lucid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mathematical grief-mapping via taxidermy eyes and fracture-etched memory is non-obvious yet inevitable; risk-taking in subterranean orchard magic pays off by charging the closure image without gimmickry; no close echoes or template residue.</comment>
