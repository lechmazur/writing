<comment>Leo’s internal arc is vivid—shaking hands against steady voice charts embodied terror and new resolve. Micro-choices (kneeling amid claustrophobia, lifting shell to ear, standing to meet Marcus) all derive from prior causation and foreclose retreat. Real birthday cipher and mother’s encoded love crystallize identity change with visible cost in every tremor. Only small dip: near-diagnostic “phobia-ridden” label twice when sensation already dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as hard-earned Resonant Reconfiguration—seashell + cast tokens convert terror into agency and renounce the false self, cost exacted in open vulnerability. Causal lattice holds: betrayal → discovery → cipher → decision, each step because/therefore linked. One beat of ellipsis (how Marcus tracked Leo) is mild; no amnesia. Final beat crystallizes options with felt price, satisfying 9-bar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rusted library under peeled iron serves as micro-arena, its decaying order echoing obliterated identity; specific grit under Leo’s knees and starlight slicing roof pressure the beat. Sensory choice narrows under crisis—rust flakes, cold air, the seashell’s whispered numbers all tangible. Setting does not constrain choice further at the very end (could exit freely), keeping it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving vulnerability as power—escalates steadily: document obliterates identity → cipher narrows future → Leo must act while terrified. Because/therefore causal lens drives each intensification. Final confrontation will demand embodied cost with no exit; closure reweights self-worth, but no third on-page reversal at climax keeps it shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from embodied particulars, never asserted: cast scrawl and whispering shell turn childhood relics into weapons of self-recovery. Final stance (“trembling but whole”) delivers conceptual repricing—vulnerability recognized as raw strength—without sermon. Thematic coherence is complete and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lean, cinematic, and tuned to stunt-dare tempo. Sensory selectivity mirrors stunt-performer perceptual bias—always cataloguing exits and surfaces. Free indirect style clean, no head-hop. One rhythm repetition (“deep-seated terror”) is minor; overall texture distinct and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose propels via sentence-level urgency minus loops. “The man he’d called his handler… had been containing him, erasing him” is incisive exposition. Concrete specificity—star-point five, wavy-line seven—avoids vagueness. Only minor hedge: “a desperate, encrypted sigh” leans purple amidst taut prior sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh inflection: parent-child cipher encoded in child’s cast and mutilated seashell as rescue GPS. Memory-toy relic turned survivor tool is unexpected yet inevitable stunt-philosopher move. Risk leans emotional rather than structural, enhancing stakes without clarity loss. Tiny derivative echo—“threw himself from moving vehicles”—caps it at 8.9.</comment>
