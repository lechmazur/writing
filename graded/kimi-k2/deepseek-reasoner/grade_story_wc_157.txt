<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s interiority is vivid—his “vibrant garden of unregistered ideas” and the moment he “understood” amid green/red chaos show embodied contradiction. Motivation (“stand guard over your own spark”) drives every beat, culminating in the deliberate self-sacrifice of destroying his code. Micro-choices (shaking the rattle in a single furious rhythm, kneeling with crushed lavender) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The only minor slip is Hemlock’s cryptic aphorisms feel slightly ornamental rather than crucible-level pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the warp disperses the network and reweights the premise—thoughts may be taxed, but chaotic blooming cannot be. Causal lens holds: each beat (charm entry → learn rattle → map gardens → warp pattern) tightens options until the final dispersal. Cost is legible in Lysander’s arrest and the ruined beds. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s humid jungle and drone’s red blink constrain tactics—Lysander learns the rattle here, later returns to send the hawk-shadow signal. Gardens shift from safe grid to trap, then to untraceable proliferation; setting actively shapes choices. Sensory detail is selective—chlorophyll stains, spectral green light—filtered through Lysander’s urgency. Micro-setting (gourd rattle as tool) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the unregistered mind—escalates as Auditors close in. One decisive tightening: Lysander chooses to warp the pattern, sacrificing the code and his freedom. Cost is visible—hands in dirt, arrest, ruined lexicon. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language, control, and the unquantifiable wild. The final image—chaotic gardens multiplying beyond audit—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (crushed lavender offered to Auditors) and silence. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—scholarly yet urgent, with rhythmic control (“converging chaos of pressure”). Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“For your nerves”). Internal texture consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined. Minor register lift in “spectral green light” but fits POV. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—taxable thoughts, cricket-coded gardens—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test: story collapses without cricket rattle and edible lexicon. Risky dispersal ending pays off. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
