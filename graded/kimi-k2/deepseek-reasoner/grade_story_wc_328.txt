<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s gallows-humour drive and evolving stance are vivid; contradictory interiority (“cosmic joke” against awe) propels the metamorphosis. Flaws (bitterness) sabotage choices, and the change feels earned. Lacks deeper social stakes or secondary voices, yet stands solid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causality linkages (arrowhead tug → phone static → garden warp → transcendence) tighten options under Causal lens. Closure (CR) reweights the premise with visible cost: Elara’s human form foreclosed. Fair mid-scene anchor clarity; no POV drifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garden’s micro-gravity, ghost-pepper orbs, and playful physics constrain movement and supply resources. Specific sensory detail charges the final image; steady, purposeful anchors throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—hill of lost hikers—escalates via arrowhead’s whim that narrows Elara’s path. Each beat increases conceptual cost; freedom vs. wonder crystallizes into irreversible choice at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “frostbitten hope” emerges through Elara’s bitter defiance curdling into submission to beauty; final light reweights prior skepticism without moralising. Complexity remains intact; subtext lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric-leaning diction, rhythmic compression under wonder/desperation. One POV; voice distinct enough. Majestic interiority without therapy-speak; one head-slide early garden orientation overtold but recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is sinewy, information-dense, and propulsive; metaphors (“gravitationally playful”) are specific and earned. Zero loops; one minor syllabic cluster near plant names barely registers. High publishability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore object + cosmic transcendence feels inevitable; playful gravity as manifest physics/smart layers justification. High risk, high payoff. Quiet ending charges rather than satisfies—bold stance held steady.</comment>
