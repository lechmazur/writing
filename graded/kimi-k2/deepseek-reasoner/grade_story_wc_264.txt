<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s dreamlessness and conditioning are embodied and visible—her mind a "still lake." Interior contradiction surfaces subtly when protocol clashes with an "unacceptable" spark. The final acceptance of custodianship is rooted in earlier traits: her emptiness is exactly why she withstands archive overload. The cost is visible—she remains, forever—in an Earned Stasis that fulfills the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world superimposes, the clock is forever stuck at midnight, and Elara’s renunciation (stay and garden) forecloses return to crawl-route life. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each bloom/petal image layers density until "she hummed a song of everything that could still be" crystallizes the new stance. One meaningful tightening—archive death vs. nurture—is legible, cost felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune, brass box, and crystalline sand are vivid specificity. They constrain: the dune must be climbed, the box handled, sand crunching under boots grounds the moment. Micro-setting anchors the POV spatially. However, the environment is backdrop rather than active constraint at climax—glow brightens not through terrain agency but Elara’s act—capping below the active-environment 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>The dominant stake “archive dies vs. Elara becomes guardian” is signaled early and tightens once: the moment archive glow fades and threads unravel. Escalation is an intensification under Accumulative lens—threads fraying felt scene-to-scene. Visible cost: Elara’s endless anchoring. Yet one-tightening-only keeps it just under 7+ high-bar pressure depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>The fractal lullaby of “cultivate the sparks” emerges from concrete beats: her sorting timelines where kindness spreads across galaxies. Themes of possibility vs. entropy live inside action, not assertion. Final image reweights: the midnight held forever isn’t a moral but a non-literal, poignant stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Voice is textured, lyric, and POV-anchored: “world superimposed”; “garden of might-bes and never-weres.” Rhythms modulate with pressure—short fragments under overload, longer arcs during lullaby. Slight register drift when “probabilistic archive repository not of one history”—momentarily academic—mutes pristine coherence but recovers swiftly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Elegant density: “petals shining with renewed vigor, each one now a window to a world.” Minor density clump “a hurricane of might-bes and never-weres” could be leaner, and “a song of everything that could still be” veers toward grand sentimentality. No loops or scaffold impede clarity, but one mixed-metaphor—“a migraine made cosmos”—edges into figurative muddle albeit brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The premise turns mandated dreamlessness into strength rather than weakness—an inversion rarely seen. Physics tropes (quantum engine, wave functions) serve character rather than window dressing. Specificity—“brass-bound box etched with impossible geometries”—makes the archive an irreplaceable image. Final refrain of midnight held forever synthesizes prior motifs into a quiet yet bold resonance. The piece takes risk but lands cleanly.</comment>
