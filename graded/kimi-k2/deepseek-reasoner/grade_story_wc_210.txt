<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots “whisper” through dust, the bottle’s weight is an “anchor”—but the final beat of watching echoes “live, love, and simply be” drifts into summary rather than a micro-choice that crystallizes cost. The contradiction between rejecting false comfort and building a monument to it is present but not fully dramatized in a single decisive act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s silence is reweighted into “rich, full, and true” memory-resonance, with the amber bottle’s glow as the felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lantern touched accumulates into the final tapestry—without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is rendered through selective, urgent detail—spectral glow, dust, cliffside workshop—each element constraining Elara’s solitude and later guiding the copper-wire array. The lanterns evolve from passive décor to active projectors, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to answer the old wishes permanently—tightens once when Elara decides to resurrect echoes rather than repopulate. The cost is visible in her fevered labor and the irrevocable solitude that follows; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as both elegy and resurrection. The final image of luminous townspeople offers a non-literal answer—eternal remembrance without flesh—avoiding moralizing. Subtext hums in the amber bottle’s sealed warmth and the silence that “felt rich.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-anchored: “her sanctuary and prison” compresses decades of exile in five words. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during fevered work, longer cadences in the final tableau—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Minor scaffold—“glow of the untouched lanterns” followed by “gentle light illuminating”—is offset by high information density and zero mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of alchemy, sealed essence, and memory-resurrection feels inevitable and fresh; the amber bottle’s impossible nature is never explained yet fully trusted. Risk-taking in the quiet, non-ghost resurrection pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
