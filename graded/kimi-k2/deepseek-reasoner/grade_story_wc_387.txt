<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hideo’s quiet endurance and “demure audacity” are embodied in the final gesture: the un-whistled circle of fireflies that wordlessly silences the headman. The contradiction between humility and boldness is dramatized, not labeled, and the cost—his nightly labor now exposed and judged—lands on the page. Interiority stays concrete, tied to the whisk, moss, and insect light. Only the headman’s pressure feels slightly generic, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing circle reweights the entire story’s premise, proving the “hidden effort” visible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each ritual beat thickens pattern until the single crystallizing image. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation. Cost is felt in the headman’s stunned retreat and Hideo’s resumed vigil. One hairline slip: the circle’s five-second duration is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet’s wet stone, prismatic droplets, and mist-soaked pines are filtered through Hideo’s net-mender gaze; every sensory note serves the thematic weave. The bamboo whisk and moonlit moss constrain his posture and ritual, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the parapet edge) literally shapes the firefly circle’s geometry. A touch more tactile interaction with the stone could have nudged it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Hideo’s right to value invisible labor over utilitarian demands—tightens when the headman intrudes. The firefly circle is the single decisive intensification, foreclosing the headman’s complaint without violence. Cost is the social risk of exposure. Agency is subtle (a withheld whistle) yet causal under Accumulative lens. Just shy of 8.2 because the headman’s threat never escalates beyond words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of mending and witnessing; no statement is needed when the fireflies themselves form a luminous net. The final image reweights every prior “broken thread” into a living tapestry. Subtext in the headman’s silence carries more weight than any dialogue. One minor echo of “hidden effort” in narration keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, and precise—“scintillatingly somber,” “tireless, hidden mending”—mirroring Hideo’s patient attention. Free-indirect texture aligns with his occupation; the prose feels mended rather than merely written. No POV drift; even the headman’s speech is filtered through Hideo’s perception. A single elevated phrase (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating during the firefly convergence. Figurative language is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—“his fingers perpetually tracing the broken threads others cast aside” does triple work. Only a faint loop of “hidden effort” recurs without new inflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of net-mending philosophy with firefly semaphore feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The bamboo whisk repurposed as divining rod, the moon paths as mental cartography—each transforms familiar material. Risk lies in the quiet refusal of confrontation, yet the payoff lands. A hairline deduction for the near-allegorical headman.</comment>
