<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—revolutionary turned archaeologist of remorse—drives every micro-choice; the shard’s discovery and her re-translation enact a credible renunciation of vengeance with visible cost in the final image. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm’s rising visual time and mirror-covering pattern tighten stakes until the shard’s refracted light reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes into eulogy, cost legible in her burnished sorrow. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and mirrored halls are filtered through Elara’s selective attention; the shard’s micro-setting constrains her translation posture and charges the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and refracted light over visual catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem a civilization’s memory—tightens once when the shard’s glyphs force a choice between vengeance and empathy. Pressure grows via storm and mirror ritual; cost is the relinquishing of her old revolutionary identity, felt on page. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of remorse as redemption emerges from the shard’s lament, not authorial statement. Final image of uncovered mirrors reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity sustained: conquerors remain flawed yet capable of grief. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric, poet-narrator voice remains consistent; perceptual signature favors metaphor and selective sensory detail. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Compression and patterned elision taught early (“time had become a thing one could see”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure beats without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates with storm intensity. Clean mechanics; shard imagery recurs with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: visible time as auroral curtain, mirror-covering as ritual grief, shard as vessel of collective remorse. Premise transformed through Elara’s specific stakes; no derivative echoes. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
