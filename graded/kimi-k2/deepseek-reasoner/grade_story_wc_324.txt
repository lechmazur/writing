<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her curiosity is dramatized through the risky use of the hearing-aid and the promise she makes. The final renunciation—accepting the burden of speech instead of mere listening—carries visible cost and is rooted in her established trait. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“because the voice fades, therefore she promises”; “because she promises, therefore she digs”) tightens options. Closure is a decisive change—she leaves with the box and the photo is now “just a photograph”—with felt cost (“heavy in her arms”). No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is not mere backdrop; its loosened tile and dead orchid physically enable the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s task-oriented gaze. The final sighing mist reweights the atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing the trapped voice—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is causal: each pulse weaker → promise → dig. Cost is legible: she shoulders a new, public duty. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “quiet guardianship vs. public truth” emerges organically from Elara’s incidental heroism. The final image of the mist parting offers a non-literal answer: silence is no longer complicit. No moralizing statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—measured, tactile, slightly antique (“brass and Bakelite”)—and remains stable under pressure. Compression and purposeful elision (“the dead call, a silent summons felt only as a chill”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she could feel”) in the hearing-aid beat keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” conceit is fresh yet fully grounded; the decades-old hearing aid as ectoplasmic dowsing rod is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of quiet heroism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
