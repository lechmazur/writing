<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>K’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“a cold stone in K’s chest” after the arsenic discovery—but the shift from passive collector to active deliverer of justice is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost is felt yet the micro-choices that earn it are summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: K’s anonymous package is a decisive act that reconfigures the stakes from private memory-hunting to public resurrection of a silenced life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each charcoal layer and whispered tale accretes until the poison label breaks the pattern and forces a stance crystallization with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is tactile and atmospheric—“steel walls groaning as if breathing”—and the tide rhythm functions as a live clock that gates K’s movements. The arsenic label itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains K’s perception and ultimately charges the final image of containers as “silent witnesses.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering an erased life—tightens when the arsenic label shifts K from curiosity to moral obligation. One clear escalation: K’s decision to compile and deliver the dossier narrows options and incurs the risk of exposure, with the receding tide marking the irreversible moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of remembering the forgotten versus the comfort of bureaucratic amnesia. The final image—K walking back into the labyrinth—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: some stories, once surfaced, become tidal, impossible to drown again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature that sees “phantom outlines of the lives each container had once held.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short, percussive clauses during the discovery, longer reflective cadences afterward—without ever slipping register or clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse but precise—“the weight of this discovered truth was a cold stone”—and never muddies causality. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the ebbing tide, tightening to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a bureaucratic ghost resurrecting another ghost via overheard port lore—is fresh, grounded, and fully committed to its implications. The transformation test passes: swap containers for any other setting and the emotional engine collapses. Risky compression of the justice beat is justified by the accumulative design.</comment>
