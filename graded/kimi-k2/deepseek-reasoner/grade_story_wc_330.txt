<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet persistence is embodied in every micro-choice—her trembling reach, the low thrum of her unused voice—yet the interior contradiction between her habitual silence and the compulsion to sing is dramatized rather than labeled. The final decision to stay and carve is earned by the causal chain of wrong turn → fragment’s hum → song → charge, with the cost of abandoning her original salvage errand legible in the last tap-tap-tap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the song re-weights the abandoned horse from ruin to possibility, and the cost—Elara’s irrevocable commitment to finish another’s dream—is felt in the charged poise of the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, chime, glow) thickens until the cadence shift of the song crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The circus train is not backdrop but crucible: the torn-open car literally grants access to the horse, the mist softens every edge to invite touch, and the wind bells create the pocket of time that triggers song. The milky glass fragment’s gleam reappears in the final charged image, constraining Elara’s choice to stay. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interpret silence as possibility—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the fragment’s hum demands voice. The single meaningful escalation is the song itself, which forecloses the option of mere salvage and imposes the cost of full restoration. Agency is hers; coincidence (wrong turn) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of abandoned dreams reclaimed through creative voice emerges from the specific image of the half-carved horse and the old carpenter’s silenced hope. No thematic statement is declared; the final tap-tap-tap offers a non-literal answer to the question of what silence can become. Subtext lives in the fragment’s glow and the mist that “softened every edge.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—her boots “whispering,” the vibration that “settled in her chest.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during song, then tightens to the staccato of chiseling. No POV leakage; every detail is filtered through her carpenter’s eye.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “bruised purple sky,” “scabrous metal,” “crystalline ring” all advance atmosphere without overwriting. Rhythm modulates from the languid opening to the percussive close. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new pressure or texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The abandoned-circus-train premise is familiar, yet the fusion with carousel restoration, the halo fragment as divine shard, and the song-as-activation transform it into something specific and inevitable. The risk of lyrical stillness pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
