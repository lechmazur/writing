<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in her still hands and dusty workshop; the micro-choice to follow the cranes is credible. Interiority is specific, but the shift from paralysis to “blooming” feels slightly compressed—more stated than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket crystallizes her new stance toward endings. Causal chain (cranes → coordinates → observatory → locket) is tight; Lyra’s vanishing is a mild ellipsis but doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Workshop dust, mountain cold, and telescope’s marble eye are vivid and selective. The observatory constrains the final choice by providing the projection tool; the dying-flower nebula image charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with grief—tightens when Elara must decide whether to re-engage with her art. The cost is the year of stasis and the risk of reopening loss; escalation is one clear arc, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-art emerges organically from the flower/telescope image. No moralizing; the final locket reweights “mourning” into “celebration of change” with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, matching Elara’s craftsperson eye. Sensory detail is filtered through her bias; no POV drift. Lyra’s diction is distinct in the single line of dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated phrasing (“skin like star-charted parchment”) flirts with overwriting but stays purposeful. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar grief-recovery arc is refreshed by the cosmic botany metaphor and the genuinely artificial tattoo-stencil locket. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
