<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood memory of the library hum anchors her vocation and later choice. The contradiction between duty to archive and duty to protect is embodied in the trembling hand that holds the wax shaving. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the melting curl’s scent of “honey and extinction.” Only the brief “venerable” label feels slightly stock, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive act—burning the shaving—that forecloses the path of preservation and carries conceptual cost (world saved by void). Causal chain: confession → recognition of harmonic → renunciation. Drive lens is Causal; every beat links because/therefore. Orientation is clear by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard garden is not mere backdrop; its orange-bloom scent and candle flame become the stage for the final choice. The wax shaving itself functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats. Only the city lights postcard line feels slightly generic, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs annihilate—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation tightens once: the harmonic reveals the recording is a trigger, not a record. Cost is the scribe’s betrayal of her life’s oath. Agency is hers alone; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship versus annihilation emerges through action, not statement. The final image of “guarding the world with her silence” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the scent of “honey and extinction” layers love and obliteration. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is that of a lifelong listener (“felt in her teeth”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for immersion, fragments at the burn. No head-hopping or register drift. The dead language line is cleanly integrated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances. Metaphors (“woolen silence,” “velvet disquiet”) are fresh and purposeful. No loops, no scaffold. Only a single near-cliché “bed of stars” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—archiving emotions as phonograph shavings—is fresh and fully committed. The accidental prophecy twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Specificity of the orchard atop a skyscraper grounds the fantastical. Risk-taking (burning the only copy) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
