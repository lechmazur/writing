<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the dog-ear, kneeling to the hopscotch grid—that escalate to the decisive tuning sequence. The interior contradiction between her sociable isolation and need for recognition is dramatized rather than labeled. Cost is visible: she gains the ship’s gratitude yet remains alone, already turning to the next blank page. A hairline slip: “sociable isolation” is slightly diagnostic shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: hopscotch pattern → musical translation → luminance reignition. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no drift. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—Elara’s solitude crystallizes as she claims a new chapter. One minor causality bump: engineers’ instant compliance feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Perpetual Dawn is more than backdrop; its creaking envelope and star-fragment heart constrain every choice. Micro-setting—the scratched hopscotch board—literally maps the solution. Starling murmurations echo pattern, charging the final image. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart the luminance or drift forever—is signaled early and tightened by each failed day. The hopscotch discovery forces a single, irreversible tuning act; cost is the widening distance between Elara and celebrating crowd. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates (starlings) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unseen cartographies emerges organically from Elara’s actions; no moralizing. The hopscotch-to-constellation reprise reweights child’s play into cosmic grammar. Final image—fresh dog-ear she will write herself—offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids tidy closure; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: precise, map-maker diction (“grammar of wind, syntax of stone”) yet lyric under pressure. Perceptual signature filters every detail through apprentice eyes. Rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses during tuning, longer breaths in starling passages. No head-hop; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“worried passengers… anxious hum”) could tighten. No artifacts in closure beat; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: child’s hopscotch as celestial tuning fork, starlings as living notation. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric cartography pays off without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
