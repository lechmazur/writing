<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“reed-blown melancholy,” “vibrating in her teeth”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to sing into the shell is causally earned yet feels slightly under-costed because the merchant’s collapse is external rather than a direct wound to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lyra’s song reconfigures the canyon’s resonance and the merchant’s fate, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The causal chain (shell clue → arch → shadow path → amphitheater) is tight, though the merchant’s sudden confession is compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The canyon’s night inversion, the seashell’s alien pearlescence, and the star-kissed arch all constrain Lyra’s path and charge the final image; spatial choreography is precise, and sensory selection mirrors her narrowing focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the canyon’s living echoes—is signaled early and tightened when Lyra learns of the theft scheme. The pressure deepens through progressive disclosure, and the final act forecloses the merchant’s plan with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: echo as moral clarity versus hollow greed. The final image of the silent shell and humming universe offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic texture and cosmic vibration. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but figurative layering occasionally risks overwriting (“webs of intrigue traced in moonlight and shadow”). No loops or scaffold; momentum is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—echo as soul-veracity—feels fresh, and the transformation of the seashell from warning device to resonant weapon is inventive. Specificity of canyon acoustics grounds the concept; slight risk of familiar mystic quest arc is offset by sensory precision.</comment>
