<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Anya’s motivation to “braid voices” is dramatized through the zither demonstration; her expectant resignation is embodied in the way she pushes the instrument toward Leo. Leo’s micro-choice—“How?”—is a credible crack in armor earned by the preceding sensory lesson. Both characters remain specific individuals rather than types, and the cost (department closure, unlearning hatred) is felt. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” is stated rather than fully shown in body language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Leo’s silent decision to listen reconfigures the noise/harmony paradigm with visible cost—his defensive stance softens and the department’s end still looms. Causal lens holds: the zither demonstration triggers Leo’s question, which triggers Anya’s invitation, which lands in the charged silence. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props or timeline slips. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The velvet library and autumn hush are filtered through Anya’s resigned attention; the zither itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the only possible lesson. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, muffled silence, faint leaf scent—rather than catalogued. The rosette’s pattern is not just visual but tactile and acoustic, guiding the final image. Could be sharper on spatial choreography (table, chairs, distance).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can hatred be unlearned before the department dies—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is a single tightening: from Leo’s defensive anger to his whispered “How?”; the cost is the irreversible closure of the program and the long unlearning still ahead. Agency remains with Leo’s choice to listen; coincidence plays no role. One meaningful turn meets scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of muting strings: harmony as disciplined subtraction of noise rather than additive virtue. Subtext lives in gesture—Anya pushing the zither, Leo’s minute stance shift. Final image of listening to silence avoids moralizing. The vanishing-arts motif could be more integrated into the stakes rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching the zither’s pluck and clang. Perceptual signature is Anya’s: “soft rustle of aged paper,” “faint scent of old books.” Dialogue is spare and subtextual; Leo’s single whisper carries more weight than paragraphs of speech. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences advance story or atmosphere without loops. Figurative language is purposeful—zither as map, noise as fear. One mixed metaphor (“traveled stillness upon the velvet library”) is minor. No redundancy, no scaffold, no register drift. Final cadence lands with quiet force.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The subtraction-of-noise pedagogy is a fresh angle on the familiar “music heals” trope; the zither’s rosette as mathematical map feels specific and earned. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-confrontational climax, but it pays off in resonance. Slight deduction for the generic “vanishing arts” backdrop that could be any endangered discipline.</comment>
