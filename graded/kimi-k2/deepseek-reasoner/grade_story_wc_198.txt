<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fatigue is “more spiritual than physical,” her longing “for a past she’d never known.” The micro-choice to play silence as weapon is credible and costly. Yet the grandfather backstory is delivered in a single expository block that slightly dilutes present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal dims, the city sleeps on, and Elara shoulders an unspoken future cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dewdrop, note, and color shard layers density until the final vacuum of silence reweights the stakes. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism atrium is not backdrop but instrument: its facets refract doom, its mist drinks sound. Dewdrops act as micro-lenses warping perception, directly constraining the timing of the harmonic counter-attack. Spatial choreography is flawless; the grotto breathes with the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing ruin via sonic negation—tightens once: the spectrum threatens to explode, Elara’s rests swallow it. Cost is visible in her slumped shoulders and the dew-tears that applaud her. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: preservation through absence, victory in quiet. The final image of falling dew reconfigures the opening “vested hush” into a protective shroud. No moralizing—only the felt paradox that saving the world feels like mourning it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to negative space. Syntax modulates from long, mist-heavy sentences to clipped fragments under pressure (“It was time.”). No POV leakage; every metaphor is filtered through Elara’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler. The line “aural threads stitching the dangerous brilliance back into neutrality” does triple sensory work without overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—musical apotropaic against crystalline prophecy—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky inversion of the “chosen one” trope: the hero wins by not-playing. Specificity of harmonic negative space as weapon is non-obvious and fully integrated.</comment>
