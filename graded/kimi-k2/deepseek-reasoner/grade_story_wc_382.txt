<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mrs. Gable’s silence and Elara’s unspoken purpose create a charged crucible; the final gift of the seal crystallizes Elara’s inherited burden with visible cost—her mentor vanishes and the city’s voices become hers to bear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glyph pressed into stone rewrites Elara’s perception irrevocably; the causal chain—lies to lessons to communion—holds without slack, and the cost (solitude, irreversible knowledge) is legible in the empty rooftop image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden’s living soil and meteor-lit parapet act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the seal must meet stone here, now, under falling stars, making place inseparable from the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to remember what her blood knows—tightens when the seal’s glyph forces irreversible communion; the meteor shower externalizes the pressure and the cost is the mentor’s disappearance, narrowing Elara’s future to solitary stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited memory and the price of truth emerges through the seal’s activation and Mrs. Gable’s vanishing; the final whispering city offers a resonant, non-moral answer to what remembering truly costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to stone, scent, and starlight; the patterned elision of Mrs. Gable’s past is taught early and paid off in her disappearance, maintaining coherent psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, each sentence advancing image or pressure; no loops or scaffold, and the final “mysterious familiarity” line recharges every prior sensory detail without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of architecture as living language feels fresh and inevitable; the transformation of a mundane rooftop into a site of ancestral communion synthesizes familiar motifs into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
