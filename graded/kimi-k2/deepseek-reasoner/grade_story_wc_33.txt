<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet obsession is embodied in the ledger ritual and the bottle exchange; the contradiction between courier duty and moral ledger-keeper is dramatized in the withheld claw. The final micro-choice—closing the ledger “like a beginning”—earns the shift with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bottle-for-data trade, ledger entry, drone acknowledgment tighten options until the child’s drawing reconfigures the map of hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s stance crystallizes with the cost of another absence to chase.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arcade’s grit and gutted neon constrain movement and mood; the prize counter glass and drone hole anchor spatial choreography. The setting’s “brittle hush” modulates with Kael’s heartbeat, charging the final image of sacred silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—linking absences to heal promises—is tested by the trade: artifact vs. location. The tightening beat is Kael’s refusal to release the bottle until data is shown; the cost is the next name added to the ledger, foreclosing rest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of broken promises and quiet repair emerges through the bottle (storm contained) and the drawing (promise restored). The final image reweights the premise: hope is a geography traced by absence, not a moral slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, tactile, slightly noir; diction like “razor’s edge” and “sacred hush” stays within Kael’s lexicon. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-sentence beats accelerate the exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, no loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language (“captured thunderstorm”) is precise and reprises in the final emotional charge. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-war courier noir and child’s-drawing hope feels fresh; the drone-as-postal-customs angle is specific and lived-in. Risky tonal blend pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
