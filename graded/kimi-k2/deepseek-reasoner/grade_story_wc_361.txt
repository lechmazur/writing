<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—boots slipping, knuckles white—but her “jittery courier” trait is stated more than embodied; the pivot from anxiety to keeper is credible yet compressed. The final choice to tend the garden is earned by the pendant’s revelation, but the cost feels lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pendant is revealed as a key, not a parcel, and Elara’s new role crystallizes with visible cost—she stays on the frozen ridge to garden memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers wonder until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action—cold seeping, stone underfoot—and ultimately hosts the living garden. The setting evolves from hostile to generative, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the last relic—tightens when the pendant proves to be a key, forcing Elara to choose between leaving and becoming keeper. The shift is single but meaningful; the cost (permanent exile into stewardship) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “wonder from routine” emerges through action: courier task → memory garden. The final image of starlight blossoms offers a non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about the price of tending myth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—frost-heaved stone, hum in teeth. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing (“roof of the world”) is earned by auroral grandeur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. Occasional lushness (“captured starlight”) is purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“seam between worlds”—slips through but does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The relic-courier trope is inverted: the delivery is to time itself. The living memory garden feels fresh, and the mentor’s absence is transformed from mystery to legacy. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
