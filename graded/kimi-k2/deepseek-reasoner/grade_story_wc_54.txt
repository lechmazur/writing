<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “stoic wonder” and “profound focus” are shown through tactile micro-choices (cleaning lenses, aligning pipes). The contradiction between nostalgia and functional purpose is dramatized, not stated. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: the terminal’s new life is hers alone, no crowds return. Minor: the “equations of hope” phrase edges toward label-speak but is quickly grounded in physical work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the steam plume reweights the derelict from stalled entropy to quiet circulation. Causal chain—sextant → solar alignment → capillary flow—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the solitary warmth that underscores absence. One micro-turn: the moment light strikes the mirror and options narrow to “this works or nothing.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terminal’s brutalist carcass is rendered through Elara’s engineering gaze—grime-caked permacrete, fractured dome glass—each detail constrains her redesign. The sextant fragment doubles as micro-setting and tool, its brass chill guiding alignment. Spatial choreography from gantry to planting bed is clean. Final image of rising steam recharges the “maze of intentions” with new flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting potential from entropy—is signaled early and tightened when the first beam hits the mirror, foreclosing demolition. Pressure is situational: the derelict itself is antagonist; every clogged valve or misaligned pane narrows options. No external reversals needed; the cost is the silence that persists after success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: entropy versus deliberate creation, measured in degrees Celsius. The sextant’s shift from obsolete navigation to calibrated weight embodies conceptual repricing without exposition. Final image of warming air offers non-literal answer—hope is engineered, not inherited. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the empty hall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, engineering-tinged, with rhythmic restraint that mirrors Elara’s stoic focus. Sensory selection is biased toward structural detail and thermal gradients. No dialogue, yet internal monologue stays concrete. Compression in the three-day ellipsis is taught early and paid off in the sunrise beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “morning light fractured through the fractured dome glass” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances action or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare and precise (“graveyard of grandeur”). Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: derelict spaceport as passive-solar greenhouse engineered via antique sextant. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk in the quiet, almost procedural climax is fully committed to and pays off. Specificity of capillary retrofit anchors the speculative tech in tactile reality.</comment>
