<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s defiant “weed” motivation is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing star charts, lifting the prism—yet the retrocognition trait is more label than lived constraint; no moment shows it complicating tactics or exacting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the prism fractures light into a galaxy-in-miniature, reweighting the premise from “restore the past” to “celebrate scattered lights.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image’s cadence shift lands with felt cost—she accepts imperfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The Glass Humming Pavilion’s fused-silica walls, wind-hum, and star-cut dome constrain every beat; the prism’s fracture lines literally shape the climactic light spray. Spatial choreography is tight; the setting evolves from dead beacon to living constellation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens through nightly charting to the triple-star convergence. One decisive intensification: the prism fails as intended tool yet succeeds as accidental lens, foreclosing restoration and charging the new beacon with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is not restored order but discovered in brokenness. The scattered starlight on the dome offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; the shard-of-hush motif reframes from silence-as-loss to silence-as-canvas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“thistle-blown hope,” “vein of liquid silver”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Focalization stays intimate; no filter-verb clutter. Compression (“the sound of light”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and scene-driven. Minor elevation in diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon of star-myth custodian.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition as archival intimacy, a broken prism repurposed into accidental planetarium, collapse-era beacon-keeper as cosmic gardener. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
