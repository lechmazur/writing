<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his tapping, the reef memory, the slow shift from “discover” to “testament” all feel earned. The contradiction between witness and archivist is embodied in micro-choices (taping the page, slowing the tap). Cost is visible in the final, deliberate beat. Minor: the “periodically eternal” label is more asserted than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s stance crystallizes into keeper-of-the-ledger under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The torn atlas page reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds: each cross-reference tightens the pattern until the salt-poisoned marsh becomes the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station’s metal spire, the mildewed atlas, the grey water—all constrain Kael’s isolation and later his archive. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“bone-white branches”). The sea’s sigh threads through as charged micro-setting. Could use one more tactile interaction with the station itself to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss of possible futures—is signaled early and tightens through data cross-checks. The salt-poisoned marsh is the visible price. Escalation is accumulative: each graph overlays the torn map, foreclosing the estuary path. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than action, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of irrevocable loss emerges from concrete particulars (reef, marsh, obsolete roads) without moralizing. The final image of taped relics beside rising-water charts reweights prior material. Subtext in the slowed tapping and “quiet heaviness” lands the cost. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, marine-scientist precise yet haunted. Syntax mirrors Kael’s obsessive rhythm: long sentences for data, staccato fragments for tapping. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. The shift from frantic to deliberate tapping is a clean modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“bone-white branches”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“periodically eternal”—slips through; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-dystopia is transformed through the solitary archivist angle and the atlas-as-ghost-geography device. The “periodically eternal” conceit is fresh but slightly under-cooked. Specificity of coral memory and salt marsh gives the piece its own weather.</comment>
