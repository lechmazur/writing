<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“bleak exhilaration, sharp and lonely as a shard of glass”—but the final beat withholds a visible cost; the triumph feels unchallenged, so the renunciation/change is only partially earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lens turns inward, revealing might-have-beens with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (yoyo → spindle → lens) holds; only a hairline slip in cost legibility keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse gallery, hunger stone, and low-tide exhale are selective, tactile, and thematically charged; the stone’s reprise in the final paragraph reweights the premise. Micro-setting (workbench, spindle) constrains the build.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightened once when the lens reverses. Agency drives escalation; cost is conceptual but legible. One clear tightening suffices for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reversing entropy emerges through concrete objects and action; final image reweights the hunger stone from warning to statistic without moralizing. Subtext in the reversed gears and darkened beam is resonant and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature (“slow exhale of low tide,” “recalcitrant beginning”) is consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hop or register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“recalcitrant beginning”) fits Elias’s arcane mindset. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of drought prophecy, orrery-yoyo, and reversed lighthouse lens; feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (inward-turning light as time-engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the uncanny premise.</comment>
