<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo’s interior contradiction—writer of cryptic futures who never grasped his own—is dramatized the instant his own fortune boomerangs. Embodied cost is palpable when the microdot burns his palm and he steps toward the controls, renouncing the diner. Relationship crucible with Alistair is thin; one line of dialogue keeps this from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fortune cookie prophecy → walk to lighthouse → discovery that he authored his own summons. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—he forfeits the apron-life and takes the baton. Microdot introduced early, paid off when revealed as instructions for him, not a drop. No orientation debt; geography and timeline stay clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Salt-spray night, slick causeway, and sweeping beam are filtered through Leo’s narrowed perception under pressure. The great lens scattering fractals mirrors his splintered identity and directly charges the final image. Lighthouse constrains the choice: only here can the light-beacon instrument be claimed. Micro-setting of the microdot in palm likewise alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain anonymous scribe or become visible conductor—tightens when the cookie returns as summons. One meaningful escalation: the ajar door forces an unplanned encounter that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: he abandons the diner, the only life we see. Pressure coherent under causal lens; coincidence (door ajar) complicates, not rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of authorship vs. ownership of fate emerges through the boomerang fortune rather than exposition. Subtext lives in the silent hand-off of the microdot and the expectant gaze of Alistair. Final image of Leo stepping toward the console reweights earlier “tunes” as navigation code—an earned conceptual reprice. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what conducting the orchestra will cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Leo’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “salt-spray night,” “slow, silent scythe,” “treacherous walk” all carry his hushed dread. Rhythm accelerates into staccato as the beam sweeps, matching rising recognition. Dialogue minimal but Alistair’s calm register contrasts Leo’s clipped panic, keeping voices distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. High information density: one sentence slips the specs, foreshadows their purpose, and shows bodily reaction. Figurative language is spare and precise—“beam cutting fog like a slow, silent scythe” is the only overt simile and it earns its place. Zero paraphrase loops; pronoun tracking clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing fortune-cookie writer with espionage lighthouse is fresh, yet feels inevitable once the cookie returns. Risk taken: prophecy-as-ops-code, but groundwork laid early. Specificity of the microdot film and the turning lens keeps it from feeling like a gimmick. Could edge higher with one more concrete detail of the network’s stakes.</comment>
