<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motives are lucid: lifelong mechanic's ears tuned for pattern, now bent on lateral-time as tangible proof. Interiority (calloused hands / surgeon precision) embodies contradiction—physical laborer chasing transcendence—without stock speech. The final decision (pull lever) crystallizes values; cost is the quiet acceptance of a universe forever sideways, not glory. Earned stasis lands cleanly; no competing characters dilute focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—time stacked transparently around her—paid in the cold warmth of irreversible sight. Causal lens holds: because she rewired the nexus, therefore time’s layered proof blooms. Drive stays causal; lever-initiated ripple shows persistent price (her image adrift in future emptiness). No orientation drift past 120; anchors crisp by word 50.</comment>

<comment>Nebula palette outside and mechanical hum beneath her boots make the observation deck a living constraint; heat blooms upward, limiting how long bare hands can linger on brass. Nailed spatial choreography: deck circle, console distance, lever heft. Tool (nexus) evolves from engine to time-scalpel; setting therefore charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is staked in para 1; tightening occurs at lever pull when multi-layered reality locks in. Escalation under causal lens: every rewiring, calibration, and hesitation ratchets stakes to single choice—continue or not. She pays with personal continuity (now watching herself), visible on page at climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges—time is plural, coexistent—not told but enacted by the overlapping tableaux. Subtext is spatial silence: beating wings at rest echo “motion even in stillness”; no final moralizing. Final image of her own future vacancy quietly reweights premise without dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature precise: mechanic’s tactile lexicon, nebula as magenta bruise, console described in warmth/cold counterpoint. Rhythm breathes with task tension, no head-hop. Syntax tightens under lever strain, releasing into hushed awe. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Scaffold-free; every descriptor performs dual duty. “Icy warmth” is not oxymoron overload but sensor paradox she feels. No mixed metaphors; diction specific to station argot. Sentence melody varied, accelerates in lever beat then falls back into awe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms time-travel trope into time-layer coexistence; rewrites mechanic stereotype into metaphysical cartographer. Synthesis feels inevitable—every tool foreshadows lensing time, every hum presages multi-layer sight. High-risk premise committed to final image without safety net.</comment>
