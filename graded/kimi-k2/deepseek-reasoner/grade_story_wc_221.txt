<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from confusion to curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (charcoal moving, eyes catching the star). The compass rose and folio act as concrete anchors for memory and motive. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost—she renounces the old fixed “true north” and accepts the burden of perpetual navigation. One notch below 9.0 only because the contradiction between paralysis and agency could be sharper in mid-scene beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of finishing the sketch reweights the premise—chaos becomes map, pariah becomes explorer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light-streak imagery and charcoal motion tightens until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the phrase “a strange and terrible curiosity,” acknowledging irreversible exile. Minor lens ambiguity in the middle third keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observation deck is rendered through selective sensory detail—humming failures, curved viewport, smeared starlight—each filtered by Elara’s urgent priorities. The temporally stretched sky is not backdrop but active constraint that forces her to invent a new cartography. The compass rose functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One missing tactile beat (how the deck’s cold metal affects her grip) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding orientation after cosmic disorientation—is signaled early and escalates through pattern intensification: streaked stars → fleeting true star → new map. The tightening occurs when the glimpse of the lodestar forces her to reinterpret rather than copy. Cost is visible in the phrase “terrible curiosity,” trading certainty for endless inquiry. Slight slack in mid-scene keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as an unending process rather than a fixed destination. The motif of mapping shifts from ancestral certainty to provisional cartography without authorial commentary. Final image—the sketch asserting order inside distortion—offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors temporal distortion: elongated sentences for streaked light, clipped fragments for the glimpse. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices what a stranded cartographer would. No POV leakage or register drift. One near-repetitive cadence (“she began to draw… she sketched…”) slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Figurative language is disciplined—streaks as “luminous brushstrokes” serves both image and theme. No loops or scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“rivers of time… islands in the flow”) is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of relativistic physics with ancestral star-mapping feels inevitable and fresh. The transformation of “true north” from fixed star to iterative process is a non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
