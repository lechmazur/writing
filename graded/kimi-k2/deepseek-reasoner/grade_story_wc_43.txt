<comment>Elara’s serene-therapist temperament and micro-choices (tone bar on vinyl shard, steady breathing sync) create consistent interior contradiction—the urge to save versus hospice realism. Final reunification choice feels earned, but the ‘decisively kind’ label reads slightly thematic rather than embodied, nudging the score down a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: results→shard→hymning→synced breath→death is driven by Elara’s agency. Closure is Earned Stasis with perceptible cost: “Arthur’s eyes were closed… his chest still.” This earns Charged Poise, making the goodbye final and legible.</comment>

<comment>“Radiant haven above the clouds” micro-setting frames the bed as floating altar; oxygen-rich scent, distant sky-light subtly pressurize the calm. Hospice room anchors are crisp; however, the larger cloud-haven doesn’t actively block tactics—the room itself already suffices—so full 9+ gating point not met.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake – flawless goodbye – escalates when Arthur eyes “a point beyond the foot of the bed,” narrowing options from comfort song to last breath. Cost registers in the still silence. One tightening sufficient under causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme coheres around broken-wholeness: vinyl shard, fractured life, final wholeness in death. No overt moralizing; subtext emerges via gesture (vinyl to box) rather than statement. Slightly tidy symbolism costs it 0.3 from 8.8 cap.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Deft third-person close with synesthetic descriptions (“clean sharp aroma of ozone”). Minor slip into poetic abstraction (“healing rain”) but remains consistent. No head-hops; perceptual signature is clear under stress.</comment>

<comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, information-dense. Occasional lyrical surplus (“pulsing stillness… still pulsing”) counts as decorative loop, −0.2 artifact. No clarity break, momentum clean. Avoids overwriting except final third where cadence echoes itself.</comment>

<comment>Vinyl-trace musical resurrection is fresh angle on hospice scene without gimmick. The transformation test passed: “broken vinyl to reunited memory” could not survive in other setting unchanged. Slight over-neat closure prevents 8.8.</comment>
