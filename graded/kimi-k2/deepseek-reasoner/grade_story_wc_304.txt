<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet dirge, lucid watchfulness, and embodied fatigue at closure all stem from prior causality; the cost—hollowed-out weariness—lands visibly. Interior contradiction is mild and mostly summary rather than in-scene tension, preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A textured Accumulative/Textural arc tightens until the green memory reconfigures the corpse’s expression—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with perceptible cost. Lens holds cleanly; orientation of skyborne grotto and task is unmistakable within the first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto’s aurora, crystalline mouth, and marble table filter every beat through perceptual bias; the stone in Elara’s palm acts as micro-setting that finally constrains infusion. A touch of celestial prettiness without tangible resistance keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—salvage a final spark—narrows relentlessly from discovery to infusion; no reversals needed, texture deepens. Cost is felt: Elara’s exhaustion paid after the last green wisp spirals away, though the price could be sharper on the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quiet question of what dignity can be wrest from oblivion is answered by wordless gleam in the corpse’s smile—non-literal resonance without moralizing. The emerald’s echo & the radiant hush’s documented silence create lingering conceptual aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Liquid, luminous diction stays disciplined to Elara’s perceptual signature; each sensory filter is vocationally precise. Minor decorative bloom in “radiant hush…memory of sound” barely crosses the line toward lyrical surplus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates through micro-beats of separation and slows for transfer; metaphors cohere around earth-green auroras without impeding clarity. One slipped crutch—“sphered at the core of silence, a silence that sang”—pulls back from full 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Geomancer-post-mortem beautywork plus memory-transfer through mineral lattice is an unexpected but inevitable synthesis, risk-heavy yet coherent. Slight overlap with “cosmic mortuary” genre keeps it fractionally from 9+ originality.</comment>
