<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—nostalgic fixation vs. the vow to paint “the truly felt”—is embodied in her micro-choices: securing the window, taking the wrong turn, painting the shell. The final renunciation (leaving the painted shell) costs her the cave itself, sealing the promise with tangible loss. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the painted shell crystallizes the kept promise and forecloses return. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in “she never found the entrance again.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quays, storm, and cave are filtered through Elara’s painterly bias; the conch and the blue-lit pool constrain her final act. Sensory economy favors touch and light over catalog. The cave’s silence and tide-sculpted shells charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise—tightens when the mirror cracks and the wrong turn forces a new choice. One decisive intensification: painting the shell as the cave feels, not as it looks. Cost is the irreversible loss of the cave. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia vs. authentic feeling emerges through concrete particulars: the broken mirror, the painted shell, the vanished cave. No moralizing; final image reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext carried in gesture—leaving the shell, not taking it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature: “weathered wood and restless water,” “cathedral of rock and sea.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the stumble, longer lyric stretches in the cave. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet spare; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (“cathedral of rock and sea”) and never muddles causality. High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or choice. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-inspiration frame is transformed through sensory specificity and the inversion of taking vs. leaving. The painted shell as vessel of feeling, not souvenir, feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in quiet, non-dramatic closure pays off.</comment>
