<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “methodically playful” testing of plaster and the fox nickel as talisman—but the moment of decision (chipping the sculpture) arrives more as inherited destiny than earned contradiction; cost is felt yet not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the deliberate fracture triggers permanent song, reconfiguring the garden and Elara’s purpose. Causal chain (coin → vision → final tap) holds, and the price—accepting custodianship of a living legacy—is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sonic garden is rendered through tactile sound and brass flora; the fountain-lotus constrains the climax, its petals literally tuning the outcome. Selective sensory detail (hum, fracture, chord) keeps the space alive without cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive or silence—tightens when Elara learns the garden was silenced by force. Agency crystallizes in the tap that completes the creator’s sabotage; the cost is perpetual responsibility, not mere repair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening across time emerges through the fox nickel and nested awakenings; no moral is stated, yet the final chord reframes restoration as resurrection. Subtext resides in the nickel’s sly eye and the creator’s engineered flaw.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“sonic alchemy,” “liquid jewel”) is character-consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence for vision, clipped for the decisive tap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; the final sentence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sound-garden premise feels fresh; the fox nickel as lineage token and the fracture-as-key transform familiar restoration into mythic stewardship. Risky nested structure pays off in resonance.</comment>
