<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the loss of smell is dramatized through tactile memory and micro-choices. The midwife-screw becomes a charged object that reframes her vocation. Final renunciation—shifting from aroma to presence—earns its cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog density, drip cadence, and brass weight accumulate until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (“she felt whole” yet can never smell again). No orientation debt; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fog, brass shop, and ticking clepsydra are filtered through Elara’s altered perception; each constrains her choices (muted scent, metallic taste, tactile petals). The midwife-screw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory economy supports theme without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to heal without scent—tightens through Mr. Hemlock’s parable and the screw’s transfer. One decisive deepening: Elara accepts a practice of touch and presence, foreclosing the old aromatic path. Cost is the permanent absence of smell, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the shift from sensory grandeur to ordinary miracles via calibrated support. Midwife-screw reprises as metaphor for gentle guidance; final image of “spaces between the drips” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; fog, brass, and silence are rendered through her narrowed sensorium. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure. Dialogue sparse but subtextual; Mr. Hemlock’s rasp and measured cadence humanize the austere shop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“thick, woolen blanket” fog). No loops or scaffold. Sensory specificity replaces generic placeholders. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the clepsydra’s drip, tightening closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapist losing scent + midwife-screw as metaphor for non-coercive healing. Risky inversion of sensory fiction norms pays off. Specificity of brass shop and fog anchors universals. Transformation test passed—plot fails without these exact elements.</comment>
