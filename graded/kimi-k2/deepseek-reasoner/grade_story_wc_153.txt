<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority—“cryptic medium” made visceral—dominates; contradictory wants to both seek and defer apology live in embodied action (wading, pressing leaf). One slip: “skin healed in moonlight” never constrains choice on page, so falls short of 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>End delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: apology is refracted through condensation and silence instead of utterance—felt cost in tears—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is locked by line 1; continuity traceable without confusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mangrove arch, tea-dark water, moonlit bark do more than paint—they become ritual apparatus: root arch is literal altar, leaf the page for condensation. Sensory anchors constrain every movement and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Stake—“the moment before deciding”—tightens through song-guided displacement; each melody shift funnels choices to the single grotto beat. Cost is legible but diffuse, lacking one decisive forfeiture beyond emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of mercy-through-meditation emerges via distilled image: water-written forgiveness visible only because regret was first left wordless. No meta-statement; resonance rises from specific materials—gargoyle rainspout, unsent paper.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Voice glows—liquid syntax, tactile diction (“tea-dark,” “brackish waterways”), rhythmic control. No head-hop; selective metaphor teaches pattern early and rewards at final condensation reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose carries oral cadence without drumbeat; every sentence performs double duty. Only micro-slip: “thick and heavy on her tongue” borders stock—doesn’t obscure, but nudges from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fresh fusion of spiritualist confession with arboreal ritual; spirit dialogue bypasses clichéd ghost tropes. Minor deduction: “mad god” simile slightly ornamental rather than world-earned.</comment>
