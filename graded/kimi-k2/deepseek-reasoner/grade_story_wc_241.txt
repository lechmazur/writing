<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mathematical certainty vs. inherited chaos—drives every beat; the tremor when she lights the lantern embodies the cost. Her refusal to forgive yet need to understand is dramatized, not labeled. The final extinguishing of the candle is a credible renunciation that forecloses the path of resentment with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern’s superposition image reweights her entire stance toward her father. Causal chain—clue → library → lantern → insight—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each breadcrumb tightens pattern until the cascade of shadows crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the vanishing “ghost of a man.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rainwashed library and lantern jointly constrain choice: the quiet archive forces confrontation with order, the lantern’s mica pane literally refracts perception. Sensory detail is selective—wet asphalt, clover scent—filtered through Elara’s probability gaze. Setting evolves from city grime to sunlit dust motes, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding without forgiving—is signaled early and tightened once: the lantern forces a stance crystallization. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent accumulation of clues. One deepening beat suffices at this length, and the cost is the ache of comprehension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of mathematical rebellion and lived addiction; no moralizing. The lantern’s “music between numbers” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. Melancholy is earned, not asserted, through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, academic yet haunted; perceptual signature—“numbers but not the music”—threads through. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses in reflection, clipped fragments at the lantern reveal. No POV drift; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“cascade of overlapping possibilities” is earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: probability mysticism reframed as failed poetry. The lantern-as-superposition-device is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image without gimmickry.</comment>
