<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—control vs. letting go—is embodied in micro-choices (hovering over the panic button, envying the stranger’s ease). The final renunciation of the laser pointer is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary pressure from the stranger is subtle but present, forcing her stance shift. A hairline slip: “envied the easy way he touched the world” drifts toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her conceptual redefinition of security—charged by the stranger’s fluid override. Pattern break (spore cascade) tightens stakes under the lens; final image reweights prior motifs. Cost is legible in her release of the crutch-button. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm constrains movement and visibility; the stranger’s permeable-path navigation is only possible because the setting’s specific geometry is mapped. Spore mist reconfigures the space mid-scene, directly altering tactics. Sensory hierarchy (blue-green light, loamy scent) is filtered through Elara’s spatial bias. One minor drift: “profound silence” is generic placeholder.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—her need to understand letting go—escalates when the spore crisis forces a choice between control and trust. Tightening occurs when she sees the stranger’s embodied solution; the option to summon force is foreclosed. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of the laser pointer. Coincidence (fault line) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: security redefined from barrier-building to permeable grace. Subtext lives in gesture (hovering finger, nod) and the charged reprise of the laser pointer. Final image offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. One soft echo: “physics of letting go” flirts with abstraction but is grounded in the override beat.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—vector-minded, probability-tinged noticing—remains consistent. Syntax tightens under pressure (“geometry was all wrong”). No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on interior texture; no POV leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“nebulous as dark matter”) is in-character.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive; figurative language is selective. One loop: “a woman who built fences in the air” followed by “holding herself together” is near-paraphrase. No artifacts in the closure beat. Rhythm modulates naturally with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion-detection mindset meets bioluminescent mycology to explore non-control. Transformation test passes—plot and arc depend on these specifics. Risky quiet ending lands with earned resonance. One derivative echo: “world held its breath” is stock.</comment>
