<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet endurance and tactile ritual are vividly embodied; the contradiction between her “wisely pragmatic” label and her secret, almost mystical faith in the marbles is dramatized through the polishing act. The final smile carries visible cost—she has staked her life’s work on an unverifiable covenant with the maze. Minor slip: the Luck official is sketched more as thematic foil than as pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s shudder and the official’s slow device-close crystallize the new reality without resolving it. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each polished marble is a textured deposit of will that finally over-weights the garden’s response. One micro-turn: the official’s screen fails to register the phenomenon, tightening the gap between metric and presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The maze’s “blooming withering” state is not mere backdrop; its suspended vitality is the physical register of Elara’s wager. The single white flower beside gray rot functions as a micro-setting that constrains her final refusal. Sensory detail is selective—thorn-scars, velvet pouch, stone bench—each tethered to her ritual and the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens know their gardeners—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the official offers relocation. Escalation is textural: each polished marble increases the garden’s quiet charge until the final shimmer reweights the conflict. Cost is felt when the official closes his device, acknowledging an unmeasurable outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the friction between quantified luck and unquantifiable relationship; no character states it outright. The final image—blue light scattering into living walls—offers a non-literal answer: presence outranks metrics. Subtext in the official’s silence and Elara’s dry smile carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and age-lined; “her voice like the rustle of dry leaves” exemplifies the perceptual signature. Polishing motion, scent of hawthorn, and fracture patterns are filtered through Elara’s gardener’s gaze. No POV drift; the official’s interior is never presumed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is restrained and purposeful—“constellation of captured light” lands because it is the single overt flourish at climax. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the slow circles of polishing, then tightens in the final shimmer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit of “luck as measurable commodity” is familiar, yet its collision with an old woman’s cracked-marble liturgy feels freshly grounded. The transformation test passes: swap Elara’s vocation or the object and the emotional arc collapses. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-confrontational climax, but coherence is never sacrificed.</comment>
