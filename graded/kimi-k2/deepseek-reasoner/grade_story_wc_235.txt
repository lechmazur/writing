<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—archivist’s compulsion vs. existential dread—is embodied in micro-choices (writing on bark, leaving the scroll). The final renunciation of passive chronicling for active climbing is earned by the dream’s cost. Minor slip: “jaded wonder” is named rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grave shifts from fixed endpoint to mutable warning, paid for by the ache of witnessing her own erosion. Causal lens holds—each dream shard tightens the timeline until the decisive act of walking away. Cost is legible in the final image of her sore body choosing ascent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cabin’s dust and boarded windows externalize stasis; the mountain’s sharp morning air reconfigures possibility. The birch scroll evolves from recording surface to abandoned testament, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (feral nostalgia, splintered roof) anchors POV without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the grave is fate or warning—tightens through each dream shard. The final choice to climb forecloses passive documentation with visible bodily cost. Escalation is causal: each remembered self narrows future options until refusal is the only path left.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of narrating one’s life instead of living it. The scroll’s abandonment and the shift from flight to climb offer a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic statement intrudes; meaning accrues through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and POV-locked: “bruised purple and orange” sky, “neurological lint.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“existentially chronologically confused”) slightly jars but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—dream chronicler meets her own grave—feels fresh, grounded in sensory specificity. The inversion of chronicling from wonder to warning is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under the causal lens.</comment>
