<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliana’s millennia-long ennui and buried ache are embodied in her indifference to the “prismatic escondite”; the moment she steps into the vortex, her contradictory impulses—boredom vs. the sudden spike of intrigue—collide on the page. The final renunciation of boredom and acceptance of witness-role carries visible cost: the fragment goes dark, her eternal stance irrevocably reconfigured. Interiority is specific (“crushing weight… dull, perpetual ache”) and avoids stock phrasing. Only the lack of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Eliana’s stance crystallizes from indifference to solemn witness, cost paid by the fragment’s spent curse and her relinquished hope of literal afterlife. Causal lens holds: solar storm → fragment resonance → spatial mutiny → vortex → revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. No teleporting props or retro-patching; every beat advances because/therefore logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, the fragment, and the cobalt-magenta vortex are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the walls’ shimmer becomes the very geometry that rebels, forcing her decision. Micro-setting (the fragment against her skin) functions as setting-object hybrid. Final image of the now-silent fragment on the shelf recharges earlier motifs. Only a hairline slip—one generic “shimmering walls” echo—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she learn what follows goodbye?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the vortex offers the single path. Agency: she chooses to step in, renouncing safety. Cost is the fragment’s death and the sobering realization that there is no separate afterlife. Escalation is causal and singular; no reversals needed. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation versus ending, the immortal as witness to eternal return. Subtext lives in the fragment’s shift from curse to relic, in the silence after “hushed thunder.” Final image of placing the inert fragment on the shelf reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy moral; ambiguity lingers yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is ancient, weary, precise: “dimensionally aware,” “intervals between moments.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses during spatial mutiny. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Eliana. Distinct perceptual signature—she notices light, angles, magnetic resonance—carries through to the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective (“cobalt and magenta energy,” “solar wind”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with tension. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she watched… she perceived”) in the vortex sequence nudges it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: immortal ennui + cursed fragment + solar storm as literal engine of spatial mutiny. The “after goodbye” question reframed as cosmic recycling feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky cosmic scale is grounded in tactile detail. No derivative echoes; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>
