<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, tool-giving mentor stance is embodied in her tactile handling of shards and tea, and her refusal to pity Kael. The moment she commands “Don’t you retreat from it now” crystallizes her value hierarchy and exacts a cost: she relinquishes solitude to midwife his return. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kael steps backward, Elara intervenes; because they annotate the shard, exile reverses. Closure lands as Decisive Change—Kael solidifies—while the drifting swing pays the felt cost of Elara’s renewed exposure to the living world. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors remain coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass archive is not backdrop; its shard-mirrors and grimy windows supply the literal tools of reversal and the final charged image of the empty swing. Sensory detail is selective—cold glass, low sun, dark arrow of shadow—each item constraining the next choice. Micro-setting (teacup, shard) functions as setting and fulcrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversibility of exile—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when Elara forces Kael to confront the fracture moment. Escalation is one clean turn: from retreat to annotated choice, with the cost of Elara’s solitude made visible in the final image. Agency remains with the protagonists; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of chosen resilience emerges from the concrete act of rewriting a single moment rather than abstract pronouncement. The empty swing’s reprise offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: stillness now carries the weight of two lives instead of one. Subtext resides in gesture—the silver stylus, the backward steps—never in exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is hushed yet precise, with tactile diction (“whetstone on soft metal,” “fluid geometry”) that mirrors Elara’s archivist precision. POV stays locked; psychic distance compresses under pressure without head-hop. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and distinct from the lyrical narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. Rhythm modulates from long, contemplative lines to the clipped imperative “Stop retreating,” matching pressure shifts. Zero scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror library, tea-leaf cartography, and reversible exile synthesize into a fresh, internally consistent metaphysic. Risky compression—expositionless worldbuilding—pays off because the pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity of the empty swing reprise transforms a familiar loneliness motif into earned resonance.</comment>
