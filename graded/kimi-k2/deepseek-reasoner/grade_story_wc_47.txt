<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile tending of moss and the amber pendant anchor her need to reclaim agency after public exposure. The quiet proffer of moss crystallizes her shift from isolation to shared vulnerability, with the cost of exposure still palpable. Leo’s arrival and acceptance form a credible crucible that alters both characters’ stance. Only minor: Leo’s voice is slightly generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: drip-pattern reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is swift; stakes (reclaiming self after viral shaming) are signaled early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared moss and watching the thawing pattern crystallize new communal meaning with the cost of perpetual exposure. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Data-center-turned-moss-garden is vivid, selective, and constrains choices: server racks become planters, drip map guides attention. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lyra’s watchful bias. The setting’s slow decay and regrowth mirror internal recovery, charging the final image. Micro-setting (amber pendant, moss CPU) also functions as tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming narrative control after viral confession—tightens when Leo arrives seeking refuge. One meaningful deepening: Lyra’s choice to share living moss rather than retreat. Cost is the ongoing vulnerability of their shared exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto wounds emerges organically from moss colonizing dead tech and from the shared act of tending. Subtext operates in gesture: proffering moss > words. Final image of ever-changing drip pattern offers non-literal answer—healing is iterative, never identical—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Lyra’s perceptual signature: “honeyed hush,” “feathery moss,” “prehistoric heart.” Syntax breathes with humidity and quiet. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; Leo’s few words feel tentative, distinct from Lyra’s internal cadence. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is selective (“moss-carpeted floor,” “cathedral of growth”) and never muddles. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“coaxed,” “traced,” “proffered”) replace modifiers. Final sentence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—data-center-as-moss-sanctuary—feels fresh yet inevitable. Viral-shame trope is transformed through tactile horticulture rather than digital revenge. Risky quiet ending lands because drip-pattern payoff reweights earlier motifs. Specificity of moss on CPU and amber pendant prevents generic swap.</comment>
