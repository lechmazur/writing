<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in tactile fidgeting and the platinum weight; contradictory impulses (pride vs. surrender) play out in scene. The final micro-choice—pressing the plate in humility—earns the closure and carries visible cost (release of anguish). Reflection stays under 20 % and is anchored to present handling of labyrinth and tapestry. Only slight reserve: the “fierce repose” label edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of abandoned threads and labyrinth moves accumulate until the tapestry’s border reweights the entire premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—surrender encoded in the click—whose conceptual cost (pride relinquished) is unmistakable. Orientation is immediate; causality holds without gaps. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stillwater’s frozen hush is not backdrop but pressure: the air itself is “woven,” constraining breath and choice. The tapestry’s frayed threads function as micro-setting that literally maps Elias’s past moves. Sensory detail is selective—cool platinum, sun-warmed stone—and filtered through Elias’s tactical gaze. The setting evolves causally: the once-ignored border becomes the decisive terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when Elias decodes the tapestry and sees the parallel to his own refusal to cut the flawed gambit. One meaningful deepening: realizing the error was pride, not the bad move itself. Cost is the felt surrender encoded in the click. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded thread increases pressure until renunciation is the only path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the necessity of strategic humility—cutting flawed threads to save the whole. Subtext resides in the border’s silent record of discarded choices. Final image reweights the labyrinth from taunt to key without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the oxymoron “fierce repose,” crystallizing the cost of surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and chess-inflected: “winnow the solution,” “defensive move that would have ceded too much ground.” Syntax mirrors calculation—balanced clauses, controlled rhythm. No POV drift; perception stays locked to Elias’s strategic lens. Compression is purposeful; elisions (no direct flashback to the tournament) are paid off in the tapestry’s map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “sun-warmed stone,” “cold, gleaming weight.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language is sparse and exact—“discordant symphony of abandoned color.” Final click lands clean, no overwriting. One minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” could feel academic, but context justifies the term.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—time-frozen village as crucible for strategic self-forgiveness—feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation test: swap setting or object and the emotional arc collapses. Risky fusion of chess logic and textile cartography pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; the tapestry-as-game-board is a novel synthesis.</comment>
