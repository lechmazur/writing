<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied code-breaking and final choice to shoulder the burden are vivid and earned; the grief-encryption motive is dramatized through micro-gesture and dance. Interior contradiction surfaces in her calm resolve versus the lab’s lethal stakes. Cost is felt when the dome ruptures and she flees with the die. Minor slip: “lyrical code breaker” is asserted more than individuated through speech or idiom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: decipher journal → dance the cipher → press wall → seize die → flood. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the lab’s destruction and her solitary ascent. Lens is causal; every beat tightens options. One micro-turn (taking the die triggers collapse) lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken dome’s groaning pressure and brass lock are tactile and constraining; the die glows as final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight, matching urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from grating to vault to rising water. Environment directly forces the climax—structural failure after the die is taken.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate knowledge versus self-preservation—is signaled early and tightened when the die must be claimed at the cost of the lab. Escalation is causal: each decryption step raises stakes until structural collapse. One clear reversal: choosing the die triggers the flood. Cost is visible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through the scientist’s cipher and Elara’s dance; no explicit moralizing. Final image—the warm die ascending—reweights the runic “execution” symbol into a key. Subtext in gesture and silence carries more weight than any statement. Complexity lingers: knowledge freed, but at personal and material loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic compression that mirrors code and dance. POV stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature favors tactile and kinesthetic detail. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“brutalist lock,” “recursive algorithm”) slightly strains the POV lexicon but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences vary in length to match tension. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. One minor loop: “cold, metal grating” and later “cold wall” could compress. Otherwise zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Final ascent line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-encrypted security solved by embodied dance in a drowned lab. The hangman’s die transformed from executioner to key feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors the fantastical frame.</comment>
