<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her luminous regret and fierce hope collide in the final dream-construction, costing her a “peculiar draining.” The river-stone grounding and micro-choice to build an original dream earn the change. Only the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow’s return and the stone’s metamorphosis crystallize new stakes with felt cost. Causal chain—observation → anomaly → theory → experiment—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis (how the shadow vanished) is forgiven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The Blooming Library’s flowering vines and crystalline spires are filtered through Elara’s dusk-watching purpose; the river stone becomes a micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Sensory economy favors internal light and tactile coolness, charging the ending when the stone warms. Spatial anchors are clear and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve hope against collective complacency—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to dream alone, paying an immediate draining cost. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversals required. The shadow’s reappearance reweights options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of individuality versus shared oblivion emerges through concrete particulars: the woman’s lost city, the generic beach, the re-ignited shadow. Final image of the galaxy-lit stone offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow’s silence and Elara’s luminous regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the dream-construction. Perceptual signature—“sharp-eyed dusk noticer”—colors every observation. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; internal texture remains coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“dying star” regret) is sparse and purposeful. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the stone’s metamorphosis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dream-share dystopia is familiar, yet the shadow-as-hope-manifestation and the river-stone catalyst transform it into a singular vision. Specificity of the Blooming Library and the woman’s lost city anchor universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
