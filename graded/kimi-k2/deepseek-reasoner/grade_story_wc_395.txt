<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in her tactile handling of data and the patch; the final upload is a credible renunciation that costs her career. Interiority is specific—her “sensed absence” is a lived pressure, not a label. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull when she deciphers the coordinates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (void in Lyra’s feed → numbers → sealed server → warehouse) tightens options until the decisive upload. Closure is on-page—files released, silence now earned rather than empty. Cost is palpable: “the company would soon discover her breach.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The humming server cavern and derelict warehouse are sketched with selective sensory detail that guides Elara’s choices. The patch’s velvet and vibrant thread act as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minor spatial slip: the safe’s location behind a “loose panel” feels generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—escalates with each recovered fragment. The numbers-as-coordinates beat narrows her path to a single night raid; the upload forecloses safety. Cost is visible: loss of anonymity and career.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased honor emerges from the particulars of deleted grief and corporate murder, not exposition. Final image—archive “finally, truly, complete”—reweights the opening “sensed absence” without moralizing. One soft line: “ghost without a body” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is crisp, data-curator precise, modulating to urgency under pressure. Compression is purposeful; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“mausoleum of status updates”) risks register drift but stays within Elara’s archivist sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence advances discovery or stakes. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“supernova” after “digital sea”—is minor and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cold-case mystery with digital archaeology feels fresh; the deleted-file conceit is transformed through Elara’s specific obsession. The Odyssey patch as both relic and data key is an inventive hinge. Risky compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
