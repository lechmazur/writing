<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority sharp—synesthetic hearing and obsessed drive are credible. Grandfather’s betrayal acts as crucible, but his passivity and off-page status limit relational dynamics. Final embrace of non-repair earns renunciation cost yet strains plausibility of decades-long fixation collapsing into witnessing acceptance in a single ascent beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lens chosen and held; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—“understood the truth”—accompanied by perceptual cost (obsidian prism crack). Compression of ascent moment after capture makes the silence legible as Earned Stasis. No orientation drift; causal chain of descent, capture, reframed ascent holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sub-sea greenhouse wrecks are visceral, consistent, and return in final uplift of “memory is … note in the song.” Aurora-lit forge becomes charged micro-setting that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography steady; tools and hull groans ground every move. No credibility slips.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“trust fracture”—is signaled early and tightened by the one-shot window of vent activation; cost is felt when Aris realizes “some things are not meant to be fixed.” Pressure grows as collectors close around sonic void; final reconfiguration does not resolve but reframes stakes under accumulative design.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly from particulars: trust as audible yet unhealable wound. No moralizing lines, yet final image of “note in the song” offers resonant reweighting. Subtext of salvage betrayal lingers without overstatement; emotional afterimage credible.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative texture is crisp, synesthetic, and consistent; diction echoes engineering ear. Compressed lyricism serves pressure. No dialogue on page, thus exempt from dialogue tests.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</figure>
<comment>Varied rhythm, high density, minimal figurative overgrowth. Small drift: “devastating, a shattering prism of obsidian and ice” borders on stacked modifiers yet holds in emotional crest. No loops or redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sub-oceanic acoustic archaeology of betrayal is fresh; synesthetic sampling of “negative sound” reconfigures familiar grief into specific undersea tech quest. No recognizable trope echo; combination of greenhouse orchard wrecks plus auroral vent yields singular image.</comment>
