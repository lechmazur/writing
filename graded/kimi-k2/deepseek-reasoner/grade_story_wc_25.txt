<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with whispers vs. shouts is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to send the encrypted query is earned. Interiority is concrete (“quiet, burning obsession”) but leans toward summary rather than simultaneous contradiction. Competence is balanced by genuine risk: the rival’s tread is felt, the storm is real. The final smile carries cost—she has won attention but perhaps surrendered anonymity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the AI’s invitation reweights the premise—whispers now hold institutional power. Causal chain is tight: coin → query → map, each step narrowing options. The geomagnetic storm is not a cheat; it scrambles comms and justifies the ancient wiring. One transition (ground → vertical shaft) is legible and brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rust-bronze maze is tactile and lived-in; containers constrain every move. The vertical shaft and hidden hatch are micro-settings that force the climb and the coin placement. Aurora light is selective, never touristy. The updated map in the final nook recharges the earlier motif of folded paper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is tested under live pressure. One tightening beat: the direct route blocked → forced climb → coin query, each step raising exposure. Cost is felt: rival’s shouts still echo, Elara’s anonymity is forfeit. Agency drives every shift; luck complicates but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: the efficacy of quiet intelligence over brute volume. Subtext lives in the AI’s silent slide of the new map—no words, only reconfigured possibility. Final image reframes earlier “whispers” as systemic leverage, not sentiment. Avoids explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “she could almost hear his heavy tread.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during the climb, longer ones in reflection. No dialogue, so voice carries through action and thought. Register consistent: technical when needed, lyrical when storm-lit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. “Corrugated steel,” “lashed-together empty units” are precise. Aurora light is rendered without purple: “rippling curtains of emerald and violet.” One mixed metaphor risk—“whispers travel farther than shouts”—is earned by context. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic quest (coin for a ghost) with logistics-AI noir feels fresh. The “key with no apparent lock” trope is transformed into an obsolete override port. Specificity of container architecture grounds the fantasy. Risky premise committed to fully; no retreat to generic tropes.</comment>
