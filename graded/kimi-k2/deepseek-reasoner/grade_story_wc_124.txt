<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s wistful interiority is concrete, the simultaneous pull of scientific detachment and filial ache is embodied in shaking hands and unchecked tears. The act of breaking the wax seal crystallizes an Earned Stasis—an irrevocable forfeiture of preserved memory—visible cost in the shared silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early by aromatic cataloguing and holds to the end; each sensory layer tightens stakes. Closure arrives as conceptual repricing: the ultraviolet revelation transforms grief into common currency, cost felt in the shared tearful silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “cathedral of crystal shadows” functions as crucible, every glass pane and phantom scent constraining the ultraviolet apparatus and the final release of perfume. Details are selective and biased by Elara’s profession—“a library of forgotten scents”—anchoring tone and choice simultaneously.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—the unlocking of involuntary memory—is intensified through escalating olfactory and emotional pressure. The tightening of options occurs when the Lunaria’s scent forces Elara from observer to grieving participant, the price exacted in the broken seal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the very mechanism of the story: the way scent dissolves professional distance into human vulnerability. No moral is stated; the reconfiguration is embodied in Elara’s trembling hand offering the vial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person close interiority stays precise and lyric without head-hop; the sensory idiom (“aromatically cautious”) remains Elara-centric. Rhythmic control mirrors the swell and ebb of suppressed grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, evocative, and information-dense. Occasional decorative flourish (“stone-like bud began to split”) barely skirts overwriting yet stays in character; no loop or scaffold interrupts final clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lantern-broker in the Underspire coaxing ghosts of scent from extinction is a fresh synthesis. Grief as a traded commodity feels inevitable in hindsight, the twist not of plot but of emotional logic.</comment>
