<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs custodial duty) act simultaneously in the hyperbolic moment. The final renunciation—turning back to help the student—carries visible cost (loss of immediate access to the nexus) and is rooted in prior causality. Minor slip: “sanely eccentric” is label-adjacent, though later embodied in her smiling acceptance of the impossible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes into custodian-of-gateway, with the felt cost of perpetual solitude. Causal lens holds: scarf → geometric jolt → hyperbolic traversal → renunciation. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s hyperbolic transformation is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail (“endless rows…curve inward and outward simultaneously”). Environment constrains choice: the warped space literally carries her farther than physics allows, then folds back when duty calls. Micro-setting (scarf as map) also charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to the nexus of stories—is signaled early and tightened when the geometry warps. Agency: Elara chooses to return to the mundane request, foreclosing immediate re-entry; cost is the fading hum of the scarf and the ache of infinite proximity. Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: custodianship as both gift and burden. Subtext in the final smile—quiet acceptance of perpetual longing—reweights the opening solitude without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; resonance arises from the image of her hand on the spine feeling the “gentle, hyperbolic pull.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: controlled syntax, scientific diction fused with poetic cadence (“equations of celestial mechanics shelved beside verses of longing”). POV stable; perceptual signature sharp—Elara notices “vague watercolor blooms” and “cold, analog memory.” No head-hopping; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined. Minor register drift in “non-Euclidean verse” but fits librarian POV. Final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—library as living hyperbolic poem—feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh synthesis of geometry, memory, and narrative ontology. Risky structural choice (spatial warp mid-scene) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity throughout prevents template feel.</comment>
