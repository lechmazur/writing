<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's survivor status, virtuous mischief, and post-cash motivations are dramatized through her touch-response to the bolt and the embodied refusal to monetize the diamond; the interior contradiction (“not profit but wonder”) shows under the crushing sub pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure, density of glitch texts, and mushroom light deepen until the crystallizing final beat; the bolt pincer serves as taught focal object. Closure in the palm: a resonant reconfiguration that crystalizes prior motifs into Earned Stasis—she refuses selling while retaining cost. No causal amnesia or teleport.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Damp sub, rust crust, and live mushroom glow anchor early; the bolt's gleaming threads amid decay function as micro-setting that constrains the final turn. Mushrooms flare into the hull for reprise, fulfilling the closure linkage rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quantum promise drives escalating metaphysical pressure—each glitch raises stakes until it pins her in the crumpled cockpit; the tightening is one coherent intensification culminating in non-salvational crystallization. The refusal to sell the diamond forecloses the greed path at felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts rather than statement: survivor’s past compressed into a single perfect lattice, mischief rewarded by participatory physics without profit. The final image of the diamond on the shelving amongst mushrooms reframes failure into wonder without moral preaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, tactile narrator: selective sensory bias (“damp, quiet dark”; “soft supernova”) reflects Elara’s awe and trauma compression. No head-hop; compression & elision (“a sudden, silent flash”) are pattern-taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density; no loops or synonym churn; fresh phrasing (“cauterized optimism”, “shadowseam wonder”) replaces stock descriptors. Occasional purple patch (“supernova of soft blue and green”) survives because rhythm supports pressure; clarity intact and closure image undamaged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cash trauma diamond alchemy via quantum observation feels fresh and integral; transformation hinges on survivor’s refusal rather than trope twist. Slight familiarity in “glitchy text” trope keeps it below 8.8 despite specificity.</comment>
