<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. belief, maternal need vs. ethical recognition—are dramatized in the garden: she first reaches to take her son, then chooses to heal the Fae and return the tooth. The embodied shift from “cleft certainty” to “wiser knowing” is earned through tactile micro-choices (bone-setting, cord untying) that carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silver blossom and returned tooth crystallize a new stance toward the impossible. Causal lens holds—each beat (enter maze, heal wrist, exchange token) narrows options and reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: she carries both child and star, the bridge forever altering her worldview.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear spatial anchors by line 3 (“stood over the small, still form in the clearing”). Garden’s bioluminescent blossoms and humming fireflies constrain choice—light guides the path, the blossom becomes the keepsake. Micro-setting (Fae’s fractured wrist) directly shapes the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve living child—tightens when the Fae demands a life-for-life. Mid-scene escalation: Elara’s decision to heal the wrist forecloses simple escape, trading immediate victory for moral complexity. Cost is felt in the lingering silver blossom and the knowledge she can never unsee the hidden world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “forgiveness that now includes the impossible” emerges from concrete events: setting the alien bone, returning the tooth. No explicit moralizing; final image of star-in-hand offers non-literal answer to how one lives after certainty fractures. Complexity preserved—no tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “nostalgic innovation,” “cleft cleanly in two.” Perceptual signature remains consistent—Elara notices selective sensory details (opalescent tooth, silver light) that mirror her shifting stance. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays tightly bound to her evolving skepticism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“tidal wave crashed against the rock”). Sentence rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fae changeling myth is inverted: the creature is not villain but grieving parent, the “substitute” a failed vessel. Specific detail (hawthorn and river clay effigy, opalescent baby tooth) transforms folklore into lived experience. Risky choice to humanize the abductor pays off, yielding fresh emotional truth.</comment>
