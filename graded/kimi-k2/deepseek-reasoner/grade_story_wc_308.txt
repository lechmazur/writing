<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s drive—“learn to navigate without moving”—is dramatized when literal stillness exposes the wandering pulse; each beat shows him choosing perception over motion at rising cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wandering pulse hooks to the arrowhead one-way: Kaelen’s touch ends the pulse in a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights his lifelong quest. Causal linkage holds under a situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tower ribs, dust, narrow strip of sky, and arrowhead scree root every beat in tactile scale; canyon’s bone scaffold layers constraint and texture without exposition bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The wandering pulse creates the lone pressure spike, tightened when the arrowhead is pulled; choice crystallizes in Earned Stasis on the arch. One escalation thread suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story reframes the wandering pulse from threat to lost story yearning for listener—subtext without overt moralizing. Closure image (“he was the harmony now”) recharges theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Weathered, precise interiority; bird-patterns taught and paid off; no head-hopping. Compression under pressure: “The weathered resolve on his face softened into quiet, encompassing grace.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density and propulsion—no loops or overwritten figurative excess. Specific anchoring verbs (“climbed,” “plucked,” “softened”) keep every sentence advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes epic-fantasy canon with intimate lens—bone towers plus arrowhead shard becomes a fresh elegy for quiet endurance. Final crystallized stance feels inevitable.</comment>
