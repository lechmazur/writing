<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Curator’s interiority is specific—her “trained fingers,” her shift from curiosity to purpose—but the moment of yielding the mailbox feels slightly under-motivated; the “heartbeat” cue is evocative yet abstract. Matteo’s cataract gaze and dry rustle voice are vivid, but he functions more as oracle than pressure. The final silence among neighbors is earned, yet the curator’s personal cost remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mailbox opens, the deed surfaces, the courtyard’s fate is secured—an Earned Stasis with communal cost. Causal chain (locket → shadow path → mailbox) holds; the “rhythmic click” bridges interior and mechanism without breaking lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard is tactile—terracotta tiles, olive leaves, ivy-draped niche—yet never ornamental; the eastern arch’s shadow literally guides the search. Micro-setting (mailbox niche) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors curator’s curator-eye detail over tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the courtyard from erasure—is signaled early and tightened when the deed appears. One meaningful deepening: stories accumulate until the mailbox yields. Cost is communal memory and shared silence, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges through action, not assertion; the final silence resonates more than any speech. Subtext in Matteo’s “true listener” line and the curator’s withheld questions deepens the motif. No moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to curator’s perceptual filter; diction (“discerning,” “sandstorm calm”) feels character-bound. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during discovery, longer breaths during storytelling. Dialogue is spare but voice-distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“heartbeat beneath the voices”) is earned and precise. Occasional elevated diction (“potent peace”) skirts purple but fits the curator’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: a thrift-store curator as archaeologist of communal memory. Locket-as-map and mailbox-as-vault avoid cliché by grounding in tactile use. Risk is modest but coherent; no derivative echoes.</comment>
