<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the Archivist’s shift from cataloguer to seeker of eternal truths is credible. Yet the epiphany—“he had been measuring the wrong thing”—arrives as a narrated summary rather than a dramatized contradiction inside the beat, blunting the cost of change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “building a new constellation” crystallizes the stakes and forecloses the prior goal of mere preservation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the pattern of fading slides intensifies until the luminous vow breaks it, with the cost being the abandonment of his old metric.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen library is tactile and selective—quartz hush, frost-veined floor—yet it never physically constrains his choices; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental to the final turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the archive’s survival—tightens through each sampled slide’s decay. The luminous vow creates the decisive deepening, forcing the Archivist to abandon his frequency charts; the cost is the irrelevance of his former life’s work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory versus meaning, the futility of quantifying the unquantifiable. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, letting the glowing vows silently answer the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, and consistent; perceptual signature—“quartz hush,” “needles scribbling”—remains controlled. No dialogue, so no risk of voice leakage; prose texture mirrors the meticulous mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm, avoid loops, and carry high information density. Occasional elevated diction (“succumbing to the entropy”) stays within the Archivist’s register. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern-slide archive above the clouds feels fresh; the luminous vows as living promises rather than recordings is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in the quiet, interior arc, but it pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
