<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s maternal drive is embodied and specific—her “featherly determination” is tested by the prism terrace and crystallizes into steel when she deciphers the grain-map. Leo’s off-stage presence still exerts pressure through the logbook and drawings, making the relationship a crucible. The final embrace earns its poignancy because both characters’ knowledge states and emotional costs are legible. Minor slip: “featherly” leans label-adjacent, though the image is carried forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (finding logbook → terrace → grain-map → reunion) is linked by “because/therefore.” Closure is a decisive change—Elara steps from terrace to ground, distances collapse, and the cost is the irreversible alteration of the maze and world. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One micro-turn (terrace dissolution) tightens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-turned-energy-labyrinth, the prism terrace, and the farmhouse interior are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice—e.g., the terrace’s crystalline surface becomes the literal map. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. The “fractured hush” atmosphere modulates with pressure. Could edge higher if the terrace’s physical rules were even more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find Leo—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs when the terrace reveals the maze’s emotional weather codes, forcing Elara to translate fear into safe passage. Cost is visible: the world outside remains broken, their sanctuary finite. No coincidence resolves the crisis; Leo’s faith and Elara’s decoding jointly earn the reunion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of love-as-architecture emerges implicitly: thresholds are sacred because a child engineered safety through belief in maternal competence. No moralizing; the final image of two figures in a “circle of normalcy” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the logbook’s repurposed codes and the grain-map’s emotional cartography is rich.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—her architect’s eye for pattern, her narrowed crisis focus. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer lyrical lines in the terrace, clipped diction at reunion. Dialogue is minimal but voice-true: Leo’s “I knew you’d read the grain” carries subtext. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined; figurative language (“rainbow’s heart,” “featherly determination”) is sparse enough to avoid purple drift. Rhythm accelerates during the descent and reunion. One minor loop: “the silence here even deeper, more profound” could trim to “the silence deeper.” Otherwise clean, propulsive, and free of scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The butterfly-effect apocalypse rendered as emotional weather codes inside a child’s maze is a fresh synthesis. The logbook-as-cipher and grain-as-map transform familiar tropes into lived specificity. Risky prism terrace pays off by literalizing “necessary distances.” Feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
