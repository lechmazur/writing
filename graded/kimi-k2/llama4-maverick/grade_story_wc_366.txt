<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Skipper’s interiority is textured and embodied (“luminescent ache”), but his choices remain largely observational; the final resolve to “continue to tend” is stated rather than dramatized with visible cost. The sea-glass pocketing and stone-stacking are micro-choices, yet they don’t force a decisive trade-off. Character is coherent but not fully tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the extinguished lamp, anonymous letters, and stone cairns layer pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the cairn’s glow reweights the ache—yet the cost is more atmospheric than concrete. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lantern room, sea glass, and stone shore are vividly filtered through the skipper’s gaze; the cairn’s “soft, ethereal light” constrains the final stance by crystallizing safety. Sensory economy is strong, though weather and spatial choreography stay background. Micro-setting (sea glass in pocket) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse’s safety—is signaled early and tightened through the lamp failure and anonymous letters. Escalation is textural: each image (glass, letters, cairn) deepens the ache rather than narrows options. A visible price is implied but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of guarding fragile safety emerges organically from stone-stacking ritual and the lighthouse’s sorrow. Final image of glowing cairn offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in anonymous letters and sea glass enriches the question of what can be preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is quietly lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“weathered denim jacket,” “soft blue, like the first hint of dawn”). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and coherent. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle dawn,” “wrapped in the warm, observant gaze”) flirt with cliché but do not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse setting is refreshed through the stone-message ritual and the anonymous-letter lore. Skipper’s reticence and the “luminescent ache” give emotional specificity. Risk is moderate; synthesis feels inevitable but not radically new.</comment>
