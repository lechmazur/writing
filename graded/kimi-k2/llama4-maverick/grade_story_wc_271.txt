<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Amira’s interiority is embodied and specific (wind whipping hair, photo burning pocket), but the “pearl of stillness” arrives as a near-epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the final resolve is stated, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Amira chooses to carry the stillness forward—but the causality is thin; the shift from trauma to resolve feels more accumulative than driven by a decisive beat. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arboretum and cliff are vividly sketched and mirror internal states, yet the setting never actively constrains choice; the lighthouse keeper detail is atmospheric, not functional. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling trauma with future hope—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via somatic markers, but the tightening is gentle; no clear trade-off or forfeiture is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of finding stillness amid brutality emerges organically from imagery and bodily experience. Final image of smoothed photograph offers quiet resonance, but the conceptual cost remains muted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually biased; diction stays within plausible range. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and often elegant, but occasional loops (“seemed to be reaching,” “seemed to be lulling”) and stacked soft verbs dull propulsion. No mixed metaphors or major artifacts, yet density could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The drone-strike-wedding survivor is a fresh premise, and the arboretum-as-refuge angle avoids cliché, but the emotional arc treads familiar post-trauma territory without a transformative twist.</comment>
