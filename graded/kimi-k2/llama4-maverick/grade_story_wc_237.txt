<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaito’s interiority remains consistent, with the crow-quill obsession supplying motive and embodied tension. The renunciation of past scars anchors the final image; however, his dialogue-free monologue leans slighty authorial rather than strictly character-voiced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass intensifies the hush into a saturated final image. Closure via ‘Charged Poise’ crystallizes when sunset erupts after the written breath; the smaller tremor beats culminate in a visible, felt trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Platform, breeze, and scent anchors recur and finally cohere into the sunset tableau; sandalwood becomes a sensory constraint. Micro-setting drifts rather than pressures—anchor four gates only three are met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single escalating stake: the tea-platform tremors escalate to the sunset climax. One decisive intensification suffices; storm delay offers coherent pressure rather than coincidence, but threat realisation remains more atmospheric than concretely constrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “transform scars into stories” quest becomes the thematic engine through image and action. Final reconfiguration reweights existence via the written sunset; overt mentor lecture aside, expression remains embodied, not preachy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture, controlled compression and enjambment under hush. Macro fits single POV without slips; experimental pattern (snapshot-to-stillness) clarifies pressure by closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Density is high; some sentence stems recur for mood, but variation keeps propulsion. Figure-for-figure craftsmanship compensates; no loops obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Trope fusion of scholar-/floating-tea/ancient-runes avoids cliché via sensorily anchored images. Risk subdued; pay-off earns but not breathtaking synapse.</comment>
