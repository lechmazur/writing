<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo’s blank mask and contradictory interiority are embodied through the compulsive whittling and narrated monologues; the final stillness shows a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is concrete (“glimmer of hope” inside “deep sadness”) without therapy-speak. The moral ambiguity is dramatized: Echo’s art both salves and traps them. Micro-choices (placing the bouquet, voice falling silent) foreclose the path of endless narration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the farmhouse becomes sanctuary, narration ceases, and the turbines loom as charged poise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hush deepens until it crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in Echo’s unreadable eyes and the swallowed farmhouse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbines, and bouquet function as micro-settings that constrain Echo’s choices; the bouquet on the mantle charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (faded petals, creaking turbines) and filtered through Echo’s perception. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Environment mirrors interior void without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Echo transmute grief into bearable art—tightens as the bouquet’s memory intensifies longing. One deepening: narrations grow more emotionally charged until silence becomes the only remaining move. Agency is Echo’s cessation of speech; cost is the unspoken loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art’s power to remake hush emerges from Echo’s embodied ritual; no explicit statement. Subtext operates in the bouquet’s silence and the turbines’ watchfulness. Final image reweights the premise: beauty persists in absence. Complexity is honored—art is both consolation and symptom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; patterned elision (“remade hush,” “cultivate lightness”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long cadences collapse into the final terse stillness. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to Echo’s perceptual field. Dialogue absent; none required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates toward the final hush. Occasional elevated diction (“poignant reminder”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—mute performer narrates grief into whittled talismans—feels fresh and specific. Turbines as mute witnesses transform familiar post-apocalyptic backdrop. Risk in lyric stasis is earned by the charged final image. Avoids cliché through sensory particularity.</comment>
