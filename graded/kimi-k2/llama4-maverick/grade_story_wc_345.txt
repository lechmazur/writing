<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s altruism is stated but never tested; she observes and nudges rather than chooses under pressure. Lyra is sketched only as gardener; no interior contradiction or embodied emotion surfaces. The settlers remain an undifferentiated chorus, so relationships cannot act as crucible. Motivation is declared (“to orchestrate collective effort”) yet never complicated by cost or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure is a communal celebration that reconfigures the planet’s energy, but the decisive change is collective, diffuse, and off-stage; Aria’s agency is spectral guidance, not a choice with visible cost. The chalked messages are clever but appear late and are deciphered in summary rather than dramatized beats. Causality is more inspirational than causal; the nebula’s energy feels like grace rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s lushness and floating rock arches are sketched with sensory economy; the arches become gathering sites, grounding social ritual in physical space. The butterfly garden and watering bell serve as tactile micro-settings that echo the larger transformation. Details are filtered through communal wonder rather than individual perception, keeping the lens coherent. Environment constrains action modestly—paths must be carved, energy channeled—but never threatens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are communal flourishing; pressure is gentle and external (harness nebula energy) rather than urgent or contested. No single character faces a narrowing choice or irreversible cost; the conflict is logistical collaboration. Escalation is additive—more pathways glow—rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The brambled hope feels more mood than risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of collective belonging emerges through shared labor and planetary symbiosis, avoiding overt moralizing. The nebula’s energy as catalyst for community is conceptually fresh, yet the emotional cost is muted. Subtext is present in the settlers’ trust of an unseen guardian, but the ghost’s motives remain unexamined. Final image of glowing pathways offers quiet resonance without repricing the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains omniscient distance appropriate to a ghostly observer; diction is lyrical but consistent. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is absent. Compression is purposeful, though occasional phrases (“kaleidoscope of colorful creatures”) edge toward ornament. Rhythm supports the gentle accumulative arc without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence lengths and vivid yet selective imagery. Occasional soft fillers (“breathtaking beauty,” “shared sense of purpose”) could be trimmed. No loops or mixed metaphors disrupt clarity. The final paragraph achieves a quiet cadence that lands the closure image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The orchard-planet ghost-guardian premise blends familiar utopian and pastoral tropes, but the integration of nebula energy as literal nourishment feels fresh. Specificity in the chalk-message method and watering bell grounds the concept. Risk is modest; the piece avoids darker implications of dependency on spectral guidance. Overall, a gentle synthesis rather than a bold reimagining.</comment>
