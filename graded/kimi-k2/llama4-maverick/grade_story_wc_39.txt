<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward generic nostalgia; the poet’s “gleaned redemption” is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choices (winding the box, lifting a jar) are present yet feel like ritual gestures rather than stakes-driven acts. The final smile reads as thematic punctuation rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet resolves to write, reconfiguring isolation into purpose. However, the causal chain is thin—no prior beat shows why this dawn differs from any other, so the turn feels convenient. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The loft’s dust, relics, and dunes outside are vividly sketched and filter through the poet’s wistful gaze. Yet the setting never materially constrains choice; jars and music box could relocate without altering the arc. Micro-setting (desk, light) supports mood but not tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve beauty for future generations—is declared early but never tested; no concrete obstacle or trade-off appears. Pressure remains static; the dawn merely offers mood, not narrowing options. Escalation is tonal, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as inheritance emerges through imagery rather than lecture. The final image of the poet writing offers quiet resonance, but the concept of “translator between generations” stays abstract. Subtext is present yet leans sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually biased toward the poet’s red-wine fatigue. Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) risks ornament but remains within character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud musical, but loops of “dusty relics,” “bitter taste,” and “forgotten dreams” create mild redundancy. Metaphors are coherent; no clarity breaks. Density is high yet occasionally padded by abstract summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Capturing sounds in jars is a fresh conceit, but its execution remains decorative; the jars never alter the poet’s tactics or the ending’s weight. The vagrant-poet archetype is familiar, redeemed only by sensory specificity. Risk is moderate; payoff modest.</comment>
