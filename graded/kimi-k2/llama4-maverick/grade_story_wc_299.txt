<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jack’s interiority is serviceable—his restlessness and longing are embodied in the tactile memory of the grille cloth—but the shift from paralysis to resolve is asserted more than dramatized. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the “spark of determination” arrives as summary. The cost of his new resolve is implied rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clear; orientation is swift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) crystallized in the final walk-out, but the causal link between phone call and resolve is thin—escalation is emotional, not tactical. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening beat lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Quarry trailer is sketched with selective sensory cues—dust, rock smell, golden light—but setting remains backdrop; it never constrains choice or charges the final image. Objects (desk, phone, grille cloth) are more active than the larger space. Micro-setting suffices, yet fails the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via memory and restlessness, but the decisive turn (resolve to “wrestle” the future) is not tested on the page; no option is foreclosed. Cost is emotional abstraction rather than tangible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of post-performance emptiness emerges organically from sensory detail and withheld action. Subtext is strongest in the grille cloth’s silent accusation. Final image of starlit exit offers quiet resonance, but the conceptual reweighting is modest—no new rule or social cost is repriced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with restrained diction that suits a former roadie turned appraiser. Perceptual signature is evident in rock-dust nostalgia and appraisal jargon. Rhythm breathes with emotional crests; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, occasionally lyrical, but leans on familiar phrasing (“spark of determination,” “hollow victory”). No loops or mixed metaphors, yet density is moderate; several sentences could compress. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ex-roadie appraiser haunted by music—feels familiar; transformation rests on the grille cloth reprise, which is handled with quiet specificity. No bold structural risk; resonance is modest. Avoids cliché but also avoids surprise.</comment>
