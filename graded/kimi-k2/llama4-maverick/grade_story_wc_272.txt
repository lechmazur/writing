<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the artist’s contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is felt more in mood than in concrete forfeiture. No secondary character pressure to test status or relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the redesign of perception is legible, and the lighthouse beam reweights meaning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of untangling threads tightens once. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Library-lighthouse is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the tarot box fragments. Setting constrains movement—“when the walls close in”—and the beam becomes the final image. Micro-setting (broken box) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform fractured reality into usable art. Pressure rises via the act of untangling; one meaningful tightening when threads reveal hidden patterns. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s purpose is to inhabit, not resolve, darkness. Subtext carried by light/dark imagery and the box’s re-figured meaning. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited sustains a consistent, textured voice. Syntax mirrors meditative rhythm; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction but remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished, with rhythmic variety and strong sensory detail. Occasional stacked metaphors (“luminescent ache,” “threads of reality”) risk overwriting but do not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tarot, lighthouse, and library feels fresh; the redesign-through-untangling conceit reframes familiar metaphors. Specificity of setting and object prevents template feel. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
