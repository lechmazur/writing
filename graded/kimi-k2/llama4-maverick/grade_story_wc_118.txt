<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emilia’s curiosity is clear, but her interiority drifts into generic “mystery-hunter” tones; the moment she lifts the tapestry fragment is vivid, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her drive. The final “smile” feels unearned because the cost of her discovery is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Emilia exits with “bronze quiet” inside her, reconfiguring her stance toward the silo. However, the causal chain is thin—no visible forfeiture or new constraint arises from the tapestry or diaries; the cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The silo’s dust, narrow windows, and scent of old books are sharply rendered and filter through Emilia’s perceptions. Yet the setting never physically constrains her choices; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the silo’s secrets—is signaled early and deepened by the diaries’ mention of “after the last human dream.” Pressure tightens once, but the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; no option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of memory as living residue emerges organically from Emilia’s tactile engagement with relics. The final image of dragons “seeming to stir” offers a resonant, non-moralizing echo, though the conceptual cost remains gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a hushed, reverent cadence that suits the “bronze quiet” tone. Sensory specificity (“heady aroma,” “shimmer in the dim light”) anchors the POV, but occasional lyrical inflation (“world both familiar and strange”) edges toward template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences flow with rhythmic variety; information density is high. A few near-paraphrase loops (“whispers of forgotten tales lingered… whispers echoing”) and stock phrases (“treasure trove of secrets”) slightly dull the edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-human quiet with medieval tapestry fragments feels fresh, and the silo-library setting is specific. The displaced-dragon axis hints at a deeper symbolic order, though its payoff is more atmospheric than transformative.</comment>
