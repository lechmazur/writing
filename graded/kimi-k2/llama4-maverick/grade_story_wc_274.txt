<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s “bravely conflicted” interiority is shown through her decision to thaw the letter and broadcast it, but the contradiction is stated more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes cleanly yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Aria watches the conversation ignite, her role irrevocably shifted. Causal chain (thaw → read → transmit) is clear and the lens (Causal) holds, though the cost is implied rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The snow-muffled library is evoked with selective sensory strokes; its quiet amplifies tension and the setting constrains secrecy, but the “echoing” motif never quite charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to release dangerous truth—tightens once when Aria commits; the pressure is coherent but the price (personal risk) is under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed history versus necessary upheaval emerges through action and image, not lecture; the ending’s open murmur invites reflection without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; the third-person limited filters every perception through Aria’s indigo-tinted vigilance, and the rhythm modulates with her heartbeat and snowfall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and atmospheric, with only occasional soft modifiers; no loops or mixed metaphors, though a few sentences verge on ornamental rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cryogenic-archivist-as-revolutionary frame feels fresh, synthesizing memory, secrecy, and subversion; the dormant-networks twist avoids cliché and grows organically from premise.</comment>
