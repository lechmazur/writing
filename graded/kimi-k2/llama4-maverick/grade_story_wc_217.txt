<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. The poet’s final “understanding” is asserted rather than dramatized, lacking embodied cost. Motivation (“discover beauty in the incomplete”) is stated, not tested by micro-choice. No visible renunciation or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mist, feather, kite, footprints layers toward a Charged Poise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the world “reborn”—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no constraint or price is legible on the page. Orientation is clear early. One transition (mist lifting) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet sand, drifting mist are vivid and selective. The drake feather returns in the final image, charging closure. However, the setting does not actively constrain choice; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. Micro-setting (feather in hand) qualifies but lacks causal bite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding harmony in imperfection—is signaled early. Pressure remains ambient; no tightening beat narrows options or forces trade-off. The kite’s snap is external coincidence, not escalation. Closure arrives via mood shift, not agency-driven cost. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of transience and woven beauty emerges through image rather than statement. Final image of footprints being erased by waves offers quiet resonance. Yet the poet’s insight is delivered abstractly (“she knew that she had discovered something profound”), blunting subtext. Avoids moralizing but leans on summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, with controlled cadence matching dawn stillness. Perceptual signature favors synesthetic softness (“burnished hush”). No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) slightly exceeds poet’s likely lexicon. Compression and elision are taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft loops (“gentle lapping… soothing melody”) and stacked modifiers (“burnished hush that wrapped around her like a shroud”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure clarity. No artifacts in closure beat. Density is moderate; some sentences could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Quiet lyric meditation on impermanence is familiar; the feather-as-transience motif is well-worn. Specificity of cobalt lagoon and dawn mist adds freshness. No structural risk or conceptual twist. Transformation test: could swap setting and feather for shell and twilight without altering arc. Freshness is surface-level.</comment>
