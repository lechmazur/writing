<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jack’s interiority is serviceable but generic (“merrily melancholic” is asserted rather than embodied). The divorce backstory is a stock trigger; no contradictory impulses play out in real time. The shift from paralysis to paddling is sketched rather than dramatized, so the renunciation lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clear; causality is causal-lite (“because compass broke, therefore paddle”). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he keeps the broken compass yet feels hope—but the cost is asserted, not visible. Orientation is fine; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coastal launch and utility poles are sketched with light sensory detail. The poles finally constrain choice (new method), but the setting never exerts physical pressure or hazard; water and weather remain backdrop. Micro-setting (kayak, paddle) is handled competently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding direction after divorce—is declared early. Escalation is gentle: compass fails → memory of pole trick → paddling. No tightening beat raises cost; the sea never tests him. Closure reconfigures stance but without palpable risk or loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of letting go to move forward emerges via compass/pole contrast. Subtext is thin; the final gratitude feels stated (“he felt a sense of gratitude”). Resonance is modest but coherent; no moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited POV is stable; prose is clean, slightly lyrical, but diction drifts toward self-help register (“align his heart and actions”). No dialogue; internal monologue stays consistent. Perceptual signature is mild.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, occasionally repetitive (“sense of calm wash over him… sense of peace settle over him”). No major loops, but figurative language is safe (“flickering flame of faith”). Clarity is high; density moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Divorce-recovery kayak journey is familiar; utility-pole navigation offers a freshish twist. Compass-as-symbol is conventional. Specificity of the coastal launch helps, but overall arc feels template. Risk level is cautious.</comment>
