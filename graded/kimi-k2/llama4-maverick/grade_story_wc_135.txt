<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is sketched but generic (“overwhelming urge,” “felt a spark”); no embodied contradiction under pressure. Motivation to compile fragments is declared, not dramatized through micro-choices. Relationship with shopkeeper is atmospheric, not crucible. Endurance earns stasis but cost is abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—harbor reborn, exile receding—yet the decisive change is summarized rather than dramatized. Causal chain from valve purchase to community healing is telescoped; pressure flattens. Orientation clear; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Closure cost is felt but diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor’s post-rain renewal is vivid, selective, and tied to emotional stakes. Maritime Relics shop anchors early; valve object constrains later choice. Weather and scent guide mood without cataloging. Spatial choreography clean; setting subtly guides installation plan.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal narrative—signaled early, but escalation is montage-like: “staggered intervals” compress agency. No single beat where archivist’s choice narrows options or exacts visible cost. Conflict remains thematic, not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as healing emerges through communal storytelling, not sermon. Valve’s reprise reweights meaning from relic to beacon. Subtext in shopkeeper’s “deep sadness” hints at shared loss. Final image of absent trumpet sound offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature leans poetic but coherent. Diction elevated yet controlled (“mist-shrouded alleyways,” “musty scent”). Dialogue minimal, functional. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical, occasionally lush (“wisps of rain dissipated over the ivory harbor”) but avoids purple overload. Some template cadence (“As the days passed…”) and mild paraphrase loops. Rhythm supports mood; clarity intact. No line-level artifacts at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Post-exile harbor restoration via archival installations offers fresh civic-ritual angle. Valve-as-memory-key is familiar but grounded. Risk lies in quiet lyricism; stakes never escalate beyond communal nostalgia. Specificity of “ocean-spray archivist” helps, yet premise could transplant intact.</comment>
