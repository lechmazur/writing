<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seer’s interiority is evocative but abstract; motives (“to understand the shape of home”) are stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The moment of touching the stone is vivid, yet the decision to “seed a new reality” arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Flaws and limits remain undramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bookstore becomes “a threshold to new possibilities.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift in the final paragraph reweight the stake. Cost is implied (a world “after remembering becomes painful”) but not felt on the page; this caps the score below 8. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is atmospherically rich, its “vaulted ceiling” and “shadows like restless spirits” feeding tone. Yet the setting never physically constrains choice; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or tool. Micro-setting (the pedestal) does host the climax, giving partial credit. Sensory layering is strong but stays ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking forgotten truth—signaled early. Pressure tightens once when visions flood the seer, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the stone’s visions do not force a trade-off until the final gesture. Agency is present but the cost of seeding the new reality remains abstract. One meaningful turn, yet its price is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-pain and home-as-state emerges implicitly through imagery rather than statement. The final image of the bookstore as “gateway” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in tactile details (feather, stone) but occasionally drifts toward abstraction. Complexity is honored, though ambiguity leans diffuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature favors synesthetic phrasing (“texture of a feather”). POV remains stable single-seer. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable jolt of recognition”) edges toward purple but stays within tolerable bounds. No dialogue to test naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet occasionally loops—“shadows that danced like restless spirits” followed by “shadows on the walls began to coalesce” feels redundant. Strong rhythmic control overall, but density of figurative language in final third slightly blurs the closure image. No mechanical errors; minor scaffold present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of mercury-glass seer, mountain bookstore, and reality-substitution offers fresh mythic texture. Tropes (mystic quest object, visionary seer) are re-skinned rather than subverted. The feather-as-tool feels novel but underused. Specificity of “after remembering becomes painful” gives conceptual bite. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent.</comment>
