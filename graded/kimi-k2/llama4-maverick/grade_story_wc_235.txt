<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-analysis (“jaded wonder,” “feral nostalgia”) rather than embodied contradiction. No second character on page, so relationship crucible untested. Micro-choices (writing, unrolling scroll) are present yet feel ritualized rather than pressured. Final renunciation of pain is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll glows, stance crystallizes, path foreclosed by commitment to imagination. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-images intensifies until meaning reweights. Orientation clear by line 3. Causality between seeing grave and chronicling dreams is implied, not dramatized, keeping score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cabin and scroll function as micro-setting; scroll constrains the act of writing and is recharged in final image. Woods remain generic backdrop; sensory detail selective but not choice-driving. Spatial choreography minimal—no impossible moves, yet no tactile navigation either. Lacks the 9+ gate of environment forcing tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning chaotic dreams into coherent narrative—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via intensifying dream saturation, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no concrete trade-off or resource loss on page. Agency is contemplative, not decisional. Cost is conceptual (accepting nostalgia) rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting loss into creative fire emerges organically from chronicler’s process. Subtext relies on image (scroll, glowing) more than dialogue. Final image reweights nostalgia from wound to catalyst without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged but not fully plumbed—ambiguity present yet leans toward consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“scratch of my pen on the birch bark”). No dialogue to test character distinction. Register remains introspective; occasional elevated diction (“maelstrom,” “irretrievable”) fits chronicler persona. No head-hopping or distance slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is fluid with rhythmic variation; some abstract nouns and mild loops (“the feeling was…”) but no dense scaffold. Metaphors coherent. Occasional filter verbs (“I felt”) do not stall momentum. No artifacts in closure beat. Could trim redundancy for 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise of lucid-dream chronicler recording own grave-haunted visions is fresh angle on familiar introspective mode. Execution leans on lyric accumulation rather than structural risk. Specificity of birch scroll and ranger cabin grounds the concept. Avoids cliché yet doesn’t push into startling synthesis.</comment>
