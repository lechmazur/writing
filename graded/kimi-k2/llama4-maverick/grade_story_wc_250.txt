<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Guardian’s interiority is diffuse; “teach darkness the value of stars” remains an abstract label never embodied in a micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final stance is unchanged from the opening. The figure’s motives are equally opaque, so no crucible of relationship forms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a mood stasis rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; nothing is foreclosed and no cost is legible. Drive lens drifts between Accumulative/Textural patterning and Situational stance crystallization without settling, so the final image lacks re-weighting power.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet sheen, and shutter-shadows are vividly textured and return in the final image, but none constrains a choice or charges the closure. Micro-setting is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is declared but never tested on the page; no pressure tightens or deepens. The guardian’s calm merely persists; no option is foreclosed, no price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through image and silence rather than statement, yet it stays abstract because the guardian’s stance never collides with a concrete cost. The final starlight reprises the motif but does not reweight the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose sustains a hushed, lyrical texture; perceptual signature favors reflected light and muted motion. Repetition of “stillwater tension” edges toward template cadence but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with rhythmic variation and selective sensory detail. Occasional paraphrase loops (“the guardian’s presence…”) and stock phrasing (“the silence that remained was almost palpable”) dull momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Shutters-as-pattern language and dental-mirror glow offer fresh sensory angles, but the core situation—mystic encounter on a rain-slick dock—leans on familiar quiet-fantasy tropes without transformative twist.</comment>
