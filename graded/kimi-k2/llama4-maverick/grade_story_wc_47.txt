<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is embodied and consistent—her fingers on the pendant, the flutter in her chest—but the “quietly proactive” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to walk out with the stranger is gentle but lacks visible cost or contradiction, keeping her arc just shy of full resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s hush and the flower reconfigure Aria’s stance toward vulnerability, and the amber pendant’s reweighting is legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern, silence, and gift accumulate to a crystallized moment—though the causal chain is light, the cost is felt in her lighter heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moss garden is vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the rusting servers and dripping icicles constrain movement and mood, while the pendant and flower act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail is filtered through Aria’s healing attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing from public exposure—is signaled early and tightened once by the stranger’s silent gift, which crystallizes her stance. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the cost is more atmospheric than concrete, nudging the score just below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of grafting pain into hope emerges organically from image and gesture; the amber pendant’s shift from wound to strength is earned. Subtext in the silent exchange is effective, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary, tempering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“honeyed hush,” “raw edges”—with rhythmic control that matches Aria’s quiet intensity. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; free-indirect style stays clean and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense without overwriting; sentences vary in length and texture. Occasional soft phrases (“a slowly unfolding peace”) slightly dilute urgency, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The post-digital sanctuary premise is fresh, and the silent flower exchange feels non-generic. While echoes of eco-rebirth tropes are present, the specificity of the server-carcass garden and the icicle pattern lift it above cliché.</comment>
