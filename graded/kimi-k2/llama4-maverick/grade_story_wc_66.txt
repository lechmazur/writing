<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s obsession with dust-as-story is clear and embodied in her meticulous transcription, but the interior contradiction (fear vs. compulsion) is only gestured at. The final “thistled calm” is earned, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply paid. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust swirls into ephemeral storyform, reweighting the alcove from solitude to portal. Causal chain—broadcast → transcription → dust animation—holds cleanly. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is present but generalized (“obsession that had driven her for years”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, radio dial glow, and mist are vividly selective and filter through Emilia’s focus. The dial’s “secretly luminous face” constrains her attention and later dims to mark closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting (desk, dust motes) functions as pressure vessel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the broadcast to animate dust—is signaled early and tightened once when the lyrics clarify and dust responds. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the final swirl narrows options: the alcove is now a portal, solitude foreclosed. Cost is diffuse but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of narrative as transmutable essence emerges through the dust’s absorption of song, never sermonized. Final image of the dim dial “waiting for the next broadcast” reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost: endless vigilance. Subtext in the “thistled calm” suggests both peace and compulsion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific: “dust motes dancing,” “thistled calm.” Syntax modulates with intensity—longer cadences during transcription, clipped beats at the flicker. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is textured and propulsive, but occasional ornamental layering (“ethereal light,” “otherworldly energy”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Rhythm varies naturally. Metaphors stay coherent; no register drift. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pirate radio + dust-as-archive + orchestra copyist creates a singular micro-myth. The premise commits fully; no retreat into cliché. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Could not swap dust or dial without breaking the spell.</comment>
