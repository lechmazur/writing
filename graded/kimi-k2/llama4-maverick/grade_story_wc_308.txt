<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The skimmer’s interiority is consistent yet abstract; it “feels” and “perceives” but never chooses under pressure. No contradictory impulse or micro-choice alters its course, so the arc is static reverence rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—stillness becomes a new mode of movement—but the cost is conceptual, not dramatized. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the pattern of layered dust repeats without a final intensifying shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The canyon’s bone towers and echoing winds are vividly selective, anchoring who/where early. The arrowhead and skimmer surface act as micro-settings that constrain the final contemplative stance, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—mastery of navigation without motion—remains abstract; pressure accrues via dust and pulse but never tightens into a decisive trade-off. The final synchronization feels inevitable rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of stillness-as-movement emerges through pattern rather than statement. The arrowhead’s reweighted meaning at the end offers quiet resonance, but the insight skirts the edge of platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntactic elongation that mirrors the skimmer’s patient gaze. No POV drift; perceptual signature is distinct in its synesthetic attention to vibration and shadow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of loops, but occasional stacked modifiers (“harmonic resonance echoing through the canyon”) edge toward overwriting. Density is high yet occasionally diffuse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of geological time with a sentient artifact feels fresh; the premise’s quiet audacity carries the piece. Risk is modest—no structural gamble—but the synthesis of stone, pulse, and centuries is non-obvious.</comment>
