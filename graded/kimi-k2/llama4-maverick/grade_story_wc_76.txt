<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority is generic (“neatly inventive mind” is label, not contradiction) and the only micro-choice—picking up the stone—lacks felt cost or contradiction. No embodied emotion under pressure; final “bleak exhilaration” is asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands (stone glows, lighthouse lit) but the causal chain is thin: the yoyo puzzle is introduced late, solved off-stage, and the cost is only rhetorical. Orientation is clear early; lens is causal but under-motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>“Rocky island,” “musty bowels,” and “flickering candlelight” give tactile anchors, yet the lighthouse never constrains action; it’s backdrop. Salt scent and seaweed are atmospheric but don’t shape tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stake—unlock latent radiance—is declared early but never tested; pressure plateaus. The yoyo puzzle is the single beat, solved without visible trade-off. No escalation or narrowing of options under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transcending fate is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized; no subtext in gesture or silence. Final radiance feels symbolic convenience, not reweighted meaning from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent, but diction drifts into elevated register (“unfulfilled longing,” “otherworldly light”) that clashes with the POV’s artisan pragmatism. No perceptual signature beyond generic curiosity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Clean grammar but repetitive phrasing (“the clock maker’s heart pounded,” “the clock maker knew”) and filler scaffolding (“As he…”) slow momentum. Metaphors are stock (“wind whipped his hair into a frenzy”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Counter-clockwise clock maker and hunger-stone combo is fresh, but tropes (mysterious lighthouse, ancient yoyo) remain surface-level. Premise intrigues yet lacks transformative specificity; could swap props without structural change.</comment>
