<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into summary (“her mind began to flow with theories”) rather than dramatized contradiction. Motivation is clear—safeguard creative space—but the cost of that choice is only implied, not embodied. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Micro-choices under pressure are missing; pacing replaces decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: dawn light crystallizes the proprietor’s new theme but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of imagery and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (night → dawn) is handled cleanly. Closure lacks a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Nocturnal brook and seed-as-micro-setting are vivid and selective. Seed returns in final image to charge closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; moonlight and water guide pacing. Sensory hierarchy reflects proprietor’s puzzle mindset. Setting constrains mood more than tactical choice, keeping score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform the seed into a new escape-room theme—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: accumulating imagery and ideation rather than narrowing options. No on-page reversal or trade-off; tension is atmospheric. Cost is deferred to future business risk, not dramatized. Coincidence (anonymous package) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of mystery as creative catalyst emerges organically from seed and proprietor’s iterative ideation. Subtext relies on silence and darkness rather than overt statement. Final image of seed beside sunrise sketches a quiet repricing of the unknown as generative. Avoids moralizing but lands slightly abstract; specificity could sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through proprietor’s puzzle-oriented perception. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; longer sentences mirror flow of thought. No dialogue, so naturalism not tested. Occasional elevated diction (“orthogonal approaches”) fits the character’s mindset. No POV drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful repetition that teaches pattern. Minor scaffold: “flow of ideas and creativity guiding her” echoes earlier “flow of thoughts.” Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Information density is high; each paragraph advances mood or ideation. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—anonymous corpse-flower seed as muse—is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes of mysterious package and nocturnal epiphany are transformed through proprietor’s vocational lens. Specificity of escape-room design process grounds the concept. Risk is moderate; no structural experimentation beyond lyrical accumulation. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
