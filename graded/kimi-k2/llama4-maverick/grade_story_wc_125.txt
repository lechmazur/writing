<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction; no contradictory impulses shown in scene. The rope token never alters her tactics—only her mood. Final “understanding” is asserted, not dramatized via a micro-choice with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning stones builds texture until dawn image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise, but cost is conceptual rather than felt—no option is foreclosed on the page. Orientation clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>Grotto’s rust-red surfaces and starlight are vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet’s touch. Setting constrains only by mood; it never blocks or enables a specific choice. Micro-setting (rope in pocket) likewise remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“impossible choices humanity must face”—stays abstract; no single choice is forced on the protagonist. Pressure is lyrical accumulation, not narrowing options. No visible price paid or path foreclosed by her final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s texture emerges through pattern and touch rather than statement. Subtextual, but the absence of a concrete trade-off keeps resonance cerebral. Final image reweights earlier motifs without exposing moral cost.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, with rhythmic control and selective sensory focus. Slight drift toward poetic generica (“passionate subtlety that resonated deep within her”) but never breaks POV. No dialogue to test.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with varied sentence shapes and strong sensory verbs. Occasional soft filler (“seemed to,” “felt”) and mild metaphor stacking, but no loops or artifacts that dull closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of terra-cotta grotto, starlight archaeology, and post-alien lyric meditation. Avoids genre clichés, yet the speculative premise stays backdrop rather than engine. Risk is moderate; payoff is atmospheric rather than revelatory.</comment>
