<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“molting personalities” as snake-skin metaphor) but remains summary-level; no embodied contradiction surfaces in the single on-page action (entering the library). The prison-library friendship is told, not dramatized, so it fails to pressure the present choice. Motive (“forge beauty from anarchy”) is declared rather than tested under rising stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the poet surveys the dawn-lit library and feels hope. Cost is gestural (“not yet saved”) rather than concrete. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of rising hope—but the final image does not reweight prior stakes; it merely restates them. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rusted library steps, moonlight, and dawn are vivid and selective. The library itself constrains the final action (it must be rebuilt), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Sensory detail is mostly visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore the library—signaled early. Escalation is emotional rather than causal: hope swells, but no new obstacle or trade-off appears. The “blooming resistance” is thematic backdrop, not on-page pressure. No visible price paid in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Theme of beauty-from-ruin emerges through imagery rather than statement. Final dawn-light reprises moonlight, creating quiet resonance. Avoids overt moralizing. Yet the theme remains somewhat abstract because the poet’s internal contradiction is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-anchored. Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous fracture”) fits the poetic persona. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops. Some minor scaffold (“the poet’s thoughts turned to…”) recurs but does not stall momentum. Metaphors are coherent. Density is good; sentences advance image or motive. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Combines vagrant poet, secret tin, and prison-library friendship in a fresh constellation. The “molting personalities” trait is underutilized, muting originality. Still, the ruined-library-as-phoenix motif feels specific rather than generic. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
