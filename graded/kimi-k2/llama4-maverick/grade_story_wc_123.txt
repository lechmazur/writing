<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is consistent but abstract; “credibly curious” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. The final resolve is credible yet cost is only vaguely felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands resolved with tube in hand—yet the cost is implied rather than visible. Causal chain (message → deduction → decision) is coherent under a Causal lens; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Courtyard is atmospherically rich but does not physically constrain her choices; the message tube is the only object that carries into closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposure of hidden lab—is clear early. Pressure tightens once: discovery crystallizes resolve. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrity versus complicity emerges implicitly through her solitary stance. Final image reframes the courtyard’s tranquility as shield and burden, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, precise, slightly elevated; perceptual signature favors meteorological metaphors. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within POV bounds. Rhythm modulates with dusk deepening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, occasionally lush but never purple. One paraphrase loop (“the storm recorder felt…”) recurs; otherwise sentences advance story or mood efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Storm-recorder-as-sleuth is fresh enough, yet the hidden-lab trope is familiar. Specificity of dusk courtyard and avian courier lends local color, but premise could transplant without fracture.</comment>
