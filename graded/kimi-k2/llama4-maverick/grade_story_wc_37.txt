<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The memory keeper’s interiority is consistent—her duty and hope feel lived—but her choices remain observational; she touches, hums, and watches rather than risking or renouncing anything concrete. The final “vanish” is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the greenhouse brightens, the realm stirs, and she steps back into darkness carrying the mica’s pulse. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—song layers build luminous density—yet the decisive change is more mood than irrevocable act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orchard-night is evoked with lush, selective sensory strokes; the mica window refracts light that later charges the final image. Setting constrains nothing tangible, but its glow becomes the story’s heartbeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric rather than narrowing. The tightening is a soft brightening, not a trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory and renewal emerges through repeated images of threads and dawns; it avoids overt moralizing. The final glow offers a resonant, non-literal answer to decay without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, with rhythmic, slightly archaic diction that suits a fable. Compression and repetition feel intentional, not accidental; no POV slippage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but occasional stacked modifiers (“soft, golden light,” “gentle, ethereal energy”) dilute impact. No loops or scaffolds, yet density could be tighter in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The mirror-world orchard and song-weaving memory keeper combine familiar tropes in a fresh, dreamlike synthesis. The mica-window portal is a small but specific twist that feels inevitable once introduced.</comment>
