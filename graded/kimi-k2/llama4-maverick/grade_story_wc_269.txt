<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific—drumming as self-regulation, fixation on the atlas—but the drive “why some paths vanish” stays largely expositional rather than enacted through on-page choices until the final realization, softening causality at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A textured Accumulative pattern is taught early: returning reef, drum, atlas, charts. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the rhythm reframes how “truth” is heard—though cost is more conceptual than viscerally shown on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station, reclaimed reef, and drum serve as micro-setting that constrains action: proximity logbook > atlas > night water. Details are selective yet atmospheric; however, no object decisively narrows tactics at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>A clear dominant stake—understanding vanished paths—tightens through data immersion and rising tide awareness, but escalation is interior (curiosity to acceptance) more than externally tested; last beat trades off certainty with quiet acceptance instead of palpable loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges gently: healing oceans do not promise certainty; listening replaces mapping. Subtext resides in drum pulse > tide pulse rather than overt articulation, yet finale avoids preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The rhythmic lyricism is consistent and apt for a lone watcher whose inner cadence is musical. Perceptual signature—visual bleaching memory, tactile drumskin—holds throughout without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm ebbs like tides—short drum taps then fluid wave lines, no repetitive scaffold. A couple near-identical sentence openings (“Maya’s...”) could be trimmed but do not stall propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The combination of post-ban eco-recovery + missing atlas page + percussive mapping feels organic rather than gimmicky, grounding grand climate stakes in intimate sensory ritual. Slight risk is tempered by specificity.</comment>
