<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s synesthetic gift and quest for “wonder” are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstraction (“certify wonder as essential”) rather than embodied stakes; the final peace feels asserted, not paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the hush released, wonder certified), yet the causal chain from song to silence is lyric rather than because/therefore; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern’s crystalline acoustics and auroral bleed are gorgeously specific; the setting refracts both light and stakes, constraining the sonic ritual and charging the final shimmer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unfetter the sculpted hush”—is clear, but pressure escalates more by lyrical accretion than by narrowing options; cost is aesthetic rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as fundamental silence emerges through image and ritual, not sermon; the ending’s hush lingers as conceptual repricing, though the emotional cost remains oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush, synesthetic, and consistent; patterned elision (“oscillating repose”) is taught early and paid off in cadence shifts that mirror the cavern’s hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fusion of synesthesia, auroral acoustics, and sculptural silence feels fresh; the conceit risks preciousness yet commits fully, producing a singular atmospheric artifact.</comment>
