<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation is declared (“to outwit the cosmic tricksters”) but never tested by a contradictory impulse or visible cost; she adjusts dials and transmits without setback, sacrifice, or interior friction. The “cautiously hopeful” label is repeated but never embodied in a micro-choice that risks failure. No relationship or status crucible is on-page, and the ending pride feels unearned because the interference beat is summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a declared victory (“the response was immediate… influence waned”) rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost. Causal linkage is weak: the counter-signal is transmitted in a single sentence and the cosmic opposition instantly folds off-stage. Orientation is clear, but the plot is an and-then sequence without meaningful tightening or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio station is sketched with selective sensory detail—console glow, static hiss, cramped air—and the astronomical charts reappear at the end, giving a micro-setting anchor. However, no environmental feature or tool ever constrains Lyra’s choices or charges the final image; the charts remain symbolic wallpaper. Spatial choreography is clean but thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (“restore balance to the universe”) but never narrowed to a personal price or risk; the interference action succeeds without complication or trade-off. Pressure is static—static hum becomes pattern becomes victory—so escalation is rhetorical rather than causal. No visible cost alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme of human agency vs. cosmic pranksters is stated outright in the motivation and repeated in the closing line rather than emerging through embodied conflict. The astronomical charts and subsonic frequencies never accrue shifting meaning; they remain literal tools. Final paragraph moralizes the calling instead of allowing image to reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays stable and Lyra’s perceptual filter is consistent—she notices frequencies, dials, charts. However, voice texture is generic academic-fantasy (“cryptic symbols,” “arcane notations,” “celestial ballet”) without idiosyncratic diction or rhythmic signature. No dialogue appears, so subtext and character distinction are untested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean but loops: “Lyra felt a shiver… Lyra felt a thrill… Lyra felt a sense” becomes template cadence. Abstract labels (“sense of possibility,” “sense of gratitude,” “sense of purpose”) replace concrete image. No line-level artifact obscures causality, yet density is low and rhythmic variety limited.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of tuning subsonic frequencies to foil cosmic tricksters is mildly fresh, but execution drifts toward trope checklist (university lab, cryptic charts, instant victory). Specificity never complicates the template; swap any “mystic hacker” into Lyra’s role and the story proceeds unchanged. Risk-taking is absent.</comment>
