<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Akira’s insurgent grit and plant-telepathy are vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“she had learned to live with, but never fully understood”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to unseal the embryo feels pre-destined rather than wrestled with; cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s glow reweights Akira’s stance toward tradition and future. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of plant-whispers and symbols tightens until the orb is lifted—but the kite-script decoding arrives late and resolves too smoothly, muting felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Volcanic sulfur, quivering leaves, and the kite’s tattered silk are sharply evoked and filter through Akira’s urgency. Yet the hot-springs setting never physically constrains her actions; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical obstacle or final charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking evolution via the embryo—is clear early. Pressure escalates through plant agitation and script shimmer, but the tightening beat (decoding the tail) is too frictionless; no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized before the orb is simply retrieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “evolving tradition with intent” emerges organically from Akira’s insurgent past and the embryo’s promise. The final image of the glowing orb reconfigures meaning without moralizing, but the insight feels slightly abstract because the cost remains off-page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, tactile, and consistent; plant-whispers and sulfur scents carry Akira’s perceptual signature. Occasional elevated phrasing (“primordial aroma that stirred something deep within her”) edges toward poetic template but stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory-rich, but repetitive sentence stems (“As she…”, “The plants…”) and near-paraphrase loops (“she felt… she knew…”) create mild drag. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing a telepathic insurgent grandmother, volcanic hot-spring archaeology, and an amber embryo feels fresh and specific. The synthesis avoids genre clichés, though the kite-script cipher edges toward familiar quest-myth mechanics.</comment>
