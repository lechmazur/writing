<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s curiosity is clear, but interiority drifts into abstract wonder rather than embodied stakes; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The final “thrill of excitement” is stated, not earned through visible cost. Micro-choices remain observational—adjusting crystals, reassembling gears—never forcing a trade-off that reconfigures his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the ticking clockwork re-animates, re-weighting the cavern’s silence, yet the cost is only implied (“carry the wonder… stored safely”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reflection study—but the single tightening beat lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is secure; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern and crystals are vividly rendered and return in the final glow, but they guide observation more than choice. The clockwork itself functions as micro-setting that constrains action; its reassembly is tactile and spatially coherent. Sensory selection favors visual over other senses, narrowing under pressure appropriately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the harvest of echoes”—remains conceptual; no concrete test or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; the season’s “healing” parallels completion but does not force a decision. Agency is observational; no price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus rational cataloguing emerges through image (crystals, ticking) rather than statement. Subtext is present but diffuse; the cellar metaphor is evocative yet abstract. Final resonance is gentle—cavern keeps its secrets—but lacks a reweighting that complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is consistent—“peripherally focused gaze,” “soft glow,” “faint tang.” Syntax is lyrical but controlled; no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, so voice cohesion rests on narrative texture, which remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but loops of “soft glow,” “winding tunnels,” and “secrets” dull density. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor scaffold: repeated “as he” openings and near-paraphrase (“he felt… he knew…”) accumulate without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Clockwork-as-memory-harvest is a fresh synthesis, yet the execution leans on familiar wonder-vs-reason binaries. Specificity of locksmith craft is gestured at rather than lived. Risk is moderate; the quiet ending avoids gimmickry but also avoids bold reconfiguration.</comment>
