<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is textured—her fever-dream clarity, the “auroral sorrow,” the smudging of margins—but the swallowed-truth motive stays abstract; no embodied contradiction forces a visible cost at closure. Micro-choices (scribbling, poring) are present yet feel diagnostic rather than stakes-altering. The final renunciation (“provisional and ephemeral”) is intellectually earned but lacks a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the truth is fluid, the station a crucible, the cost the acceptance of impermanence—felt in the “auroral sorrow.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift (logbook palimpsest → vanishing charcoal) reweight meaning. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the swallowed truth is named but never dramatized as a discrete before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mountain station is vividly sketched—mist, ozone, metal grating—and the botanical illustration recurs to charge the final image. Environment constrains choice only implicitly (isolation enables introspection), not tactically. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography remains coherent. Meets 9+ gate partially: illustration reweights meaning, but weather itself does not directly force a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the swallowed truth—signaled early; pressure tightens via accumulating marginal notes and communal contribution. No external antagonist; escalation is textural (palimpsest thickens). Closure cost is conceptual (acceptance of uncertainty) rather than a forfeited option on the page. Agency is observational more than decisive; still, the deepening pattern reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as provisional, beauty in uncertainty. Subtext operates through the illustration and the smudged logbook margins—no explicit moralizing. Final image (“faintest hint of her passage”) offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers without confusion. Slight abstraction in “swallowed truth” keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature distinct (“auroral sorrow,” “charcoal drawing”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Free indirect style stays coherent; diction remains within oracle’s plausible lexicon. Purposeful compression (“smudged, like a charcoal drawing”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Occasional elevated phrasing (“context-dependent construct”) slightly lifts register but remains consistent with oracle’s analytic bent. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fault-tolerant oracle as epistemic investigator, alpine station as liminal crucible. Botanical illustration repurposed from mere motif to epistemic emblem. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversal—but coherence holds. Avoids stock tropes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
