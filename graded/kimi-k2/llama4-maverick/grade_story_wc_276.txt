<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fisher’s calm demeanor and embodied gestures (zigzag navigation, transliterating emotions, clutching the rail spike) grant individuality and interiority. Micro-choices remain consistent with trait, but cost is diffuse—final reverence is felt more as ambient awe than a specific renunciation. Contradictory impulses are hinted but dramatized only in the silences; no clear “turning” choice that alters status. Character voice stays cool and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story obeys an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern breaks and deepening hum intensify toward Echo capture. Closure—goddess echo internalized—is on the page as Charged Poise (cosmic reweight), cost is cosmic wonder without quantifiable consequence. Arc structure is single-scene spiral; orientation anchors early and never drifts. No causality breaks, though agency is largely attentional rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Garden’s sonic texture is vivid and selective, woven into action rather than catalogued. Rail spike and vibrating ground become micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tied to protagonist’s perception (listening for silences). Grounding remains consistent, but environment never blocks or tangibly constrains choice—stakes remain conceptual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—hear the goddess via “silences”—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through pattern breaks and rising hum, narrowing focus to attentive stillness. Cost is primarily spiritual awe; loss felt in the fisher’s inevitable return obligation, not a traded resource. Escalation satisfies but leans on atmospheric accumulation rather than irreversible constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme of perception through absence blooms through image rather than assertion. “Voicing silence” and pattern breaks become motifs that reconfigure meaning at the end. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity invites multiple interpretations while retaining coherence. Subtext remains embedded in sensory events; final lullaby answers the concept non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice stays lyrical yet specific; perception filter consistently cool, sensorily focused. Metaphoric density is taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring action. No head-hopping or unmotivated slip. Distinct rhythmic lilt supports dreamlike pace; syntax varies under pressure. The compression of “feral lullaby” crystallizes tone elegantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, occasionally indulgent in atmospheric strings; minor scaffold like “its whispers continued” repeats concept lightly without harm. Sensory specificity is high; images rarely compete for turf. No grammatical drift or clarity issues at closure. Some abstract nouns (“energies,” “presence”) could trim for sharper punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Combines fisher archetype, sleepwalking constellations, and voiced-silence mechanic into fresh constellation. Avoids genre cliché through internalized cosmology. Risk is lyrical rather than structural; payoff arrives as cosmic reweight rather than twist. Freshness lies in sonic magic system; execution leans familiar at sentence level, keeping score mid-high.</comment>
