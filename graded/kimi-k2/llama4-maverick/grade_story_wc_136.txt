<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s “analytically artistic” trait is stated but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice; the punch hums, yet she never wrestles with its implications. Interiority drifts into summary (“she felt an overwhelming urge”) rather than embodied contradiction. The ending claims transformation without dramatized cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a declared epiphany rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost is extracted from Emilia. The Accumulative/Textural lens is signaled by pattern and cadence, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than crystallizes. Orientation is clear early, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vault’s mist and starlight create a consistent, textured atmosphere that filters through Emilia’s perception. However, the setting never materially constrains her choices or charges the final image; it remains backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial anchors hold, but sensory detail leans on familiar tropes (“swirled around her ankles like a chill”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“unspoken truths”—is declared but never tested in a concrete dilemma; pressure stays atmospheric rather than causal. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the path simply unfolds. Escalation is scenic, not stakes-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge versus lived truth is gestured at but resolved by assertion rather than earned resonance. The final paragraph moralizes (“she would never see the world in the same way”) instead of letting image reweight meaning. Subtext remains thin; no charged object or gesture reframes prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control that suits the Accumulative/Textural lens. Perceptual signature is present but generic—“meticulous route mapper” never colors what she notices in a way no one else would. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, but leans on elevated filler (“otherworldly silence,” “ethereal glow”) that blurs specificity. No artifacts touch closure, yet density is modest; several sentences could be trimmed without loss. Metaphors occasionally mix (“vault whispering secrets”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phantom-punch conceit is fresh, but the surrounding tropes (mist-bound vault, starlit secrets) feel familiar. The synthesis doesn’t push far enough to feel inevitable; swap the object and setting and the arc remains. A modest risk in lyric mode, but not transformative.</comment>
