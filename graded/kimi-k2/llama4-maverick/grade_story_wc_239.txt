<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is evocative but drifts toward cosmic abstraction; the “wanderingly exact” trait is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. Motivation is clear yet static—no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. The final “beacon” image gestures at cost but the price remains conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the universe’s hiccup resolves into “harmony and balance,” with Aria’s stance crystallized. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of inward/outward steps reweights stakes. Orientation is secure by 120 words. Cost is felt but diffuse; a sharper, embodied forfeiture would lift the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temple library is vivid, selective, and thematically charged; its “sentinel” shelves and “aged parchment” scent constrain Aria’s solitude and focus. Micro-setting (dictionary as tactile object) reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unify fragmented truths”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each step inward/outward intensifies cosmic attunement until the hiccup crests. Agency is present but abstract; a concrete, on-page trade-off would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic unity emerges through image and action rather than statement. Spiral arbitration evolves from concept to lived rhythm, reweighted in the final hush. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the “new song” of the cosmos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific: “whispers of forgotten knowledge,” “resounding hush.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No POV drift or register clash. Compression is purposeful; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional cosmic abstractions edge toward overwriting (“cosmic illusions,” “melody that echoed through eternity”) but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold. Strong cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lone sage, timeless library, cosmic repair—are refreshed through tactile specificity and the spiral-arbitration conceit. The inward/outward journey as method of cosmic tuning feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent.</comment>
