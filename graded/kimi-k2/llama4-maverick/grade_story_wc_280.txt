<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo’s longing is vivid and embodied, but interiority drifts into summary (“she knew that she had to intertwine”). The final peace is felt, yet the cost is abstract rather than dramatized; no micro-choice shows the price of renouncing the stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s stillness and coin’s glow reconfigure Echo’s stance with lingering cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though the timeline repair feels asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orchard and maze are sensuously anchored and evolve with Echo’s weaving; the shifting paths constrain her route, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming coherence from fractured time—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the garden’s rearrangement, but the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the cost remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of nostalgia as both wound and balm emerges through Echo’s synesthetic memories and the garden’s responsive glow. Final image of the coin’s “smile” offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and colored by Echo’s synesthetic perception; diction stays within ghostly register. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; occasional soft loops (“echoes grew… echoes began”) are minor. Figurative language serves atmosphere without muddle. Strong cadence control in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic ghost repairing time via orchard echoes. Premise avoids cliché, though “mystic garden” leans familiar. Risk lies in lyric accumulation rather than structural daring; payoff feels earned.</comment>
