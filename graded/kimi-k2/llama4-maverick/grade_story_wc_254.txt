<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is lush but abstract; the “tremor of certainty” is asserted rather than embodied in a concrete micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the surrender to the muse reads as pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. The only visible cost is the dissolution of boundaries, but it is described rather than felt through bodily or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Lyra walking away bathed in colonnade-light reconfigures her stance toward art and boundary. However, the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the escalation is one long crescendo of lyric density rather than a discrete tightening; the cost is diffuse. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, but the beat-to-beat linkage is more associative than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are rendered with sensory precision and return in the final image to charge the closure. The colonnade’s pulse functions as a micro-setting that guides Lyra’s surrender, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are firm; weather and texture are woven through action rather than catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—artistic transcendence versus safe boundaries—is signaled early and deepened through accumulating lyric intensity. Yet the escalation is purely textural; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The “dissolving boundaries” remain metaphorical; the reader feels no forfeiture or irreversible loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of art dissolving self/other boundaries emerges organically from image and action, never sermonized. The final reprise of the colonnade’s glow reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Subtext is present in the hush and crystalline fragments, though the abstraction keeps emotional aftereffect slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature is strong—Lyra’s synesthetic attention to “humming quartz” and “lantern-moth hush” feels character-specific. Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional metaphor stacks risk overwriting (“canvas of white silk,” “river breaking its banks”) but pattern is taught early and held. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or pressure. A few near-simultaneous participial phrases slightly blur action order but do not impede closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cloud-shadow poet and humming quartz colonnade synthesize into a fresh, non-trope configuration; the lyric ritual feels specific rather than borrowed. The boundary-dissolution climax is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at outset. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; slight abstraction keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>
