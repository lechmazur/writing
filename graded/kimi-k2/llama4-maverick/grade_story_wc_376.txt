<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s obsession with lost conversations is clear, but her interiority stays summary-level; we never feel the bodily cost of the descent or the moment-by-moment contradiction between fear and compulsion. The final “newfound sense of purpose” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the earned change feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the chamber of gilded scripts reweights her art. Causality is causal-lite—each step follows plausibly—but the map’s mechanics are elided; the postal plate’s decoding happens off-stage, softening the decisive turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s acidic mist, corroded processors, and floorboard cache are vivid and selective; the undercroft’s decaying air tightens the final choice. Yet the city’s geography stays schematic—no single object or micro-setting constrains her tactics, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost candor—remains abstract; pressure escalates only as “long and arduous” travel, not through narrowing options or visible cost. The chamber discovery feels inevitable rather than earned by a final trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of candor emerges organically from the calligrapher’s vocation and the found scripts; the ending image of shimmering gilded leaves offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. A touch of editorial summary (“her art infused with deeper candor”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; diction is controlled and occasionally lyrical (“ink wilts near dishonesty”). Repetition of “gilded-leaf” and “candor” edges toward template cadence, preventing a sharper voice signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, but paraphrase loops (“As she worked… As she walked…”) and stacked “seemed to” constructions dull immediacy. No figurative muddle at closure, yet the rhythm flattens under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of toxic greenhouse, truth-sensitive ink, and repository of lost conversations feels fresh, but the quest structure and “map to lost memories” trope are familiar. Specificity of orchid vendor and processor shop helps, yet the synthesis stops short of inevitability.</comment>
