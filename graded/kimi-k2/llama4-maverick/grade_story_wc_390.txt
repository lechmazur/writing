<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Azure Coat’s interiority is evocative—“logically emotional mind” is shown through her attunement to ice-creak and artifact hum—but the trait never forces a hard trade-off; the final peace feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (light, ice, gull-cry) thickens until the final “silence that was a tapestry” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—artifact safe, world unchanged yet re-perceived—cost is the fading light and her vigilance renewed. Orientation anchors early; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is rendered through pressure: creaking dock, thickening air, lighthouse hum all constrain how she moves and listens. The setting literally guides the vibrational matching; final star-pricked dark amplifies the earned stillness. Micro-setting (cabin, key, body) functions as extension of place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—protect artifact—remains steady; pressure tightens via sunset clock and ice instability. Escalation is textural, not causal: each sensory layer narrows her focus until adaptation completes. Cost is the irreversible passage of light and the vigilance she must resume; no option is foreclosed, but the burden is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges through action: artifact resonance as redemption from unnamed “misuse.” Final silence-as-tapestry offers non-literal answer—absolution is not erasure but attuned coexistence. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the word “for now.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “fleshly ethereal” is embodied in ice-creak, gull-cry, hum. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for immersion, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Azure Coat’s sensorium. Occasional elevated diction (“sonic absolution”) slightly jars but fits her engineer-mystic hybrid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor loop: “seemed to” used three times in two sentences mid-story; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythos with vibrational engineering; “sonic absolution” reframes familiar guardian tale. Risk lies in near-poetic abstraction, but specificity of ice acoustics grounds it. Not transformative enough for 8.5+ yet avoids template echoes.</comment>
