<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kaelin’s desperation and kintsugi ethos are embodied in her breath-hold micro-choices, but interiority drifts into summary (“her mind wandered back…”) rather than simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The final collapse registers cost, yet the mentor’s hands feel external, not an internal flaw complicating the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s decoded pattern crystallizes meaning while the breathless cost is felt. Causal chain holds—pockmarks → parchment match → revelation—but the workshop’s sway and acid sea remain ornamental rather than tightening options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (acid churn, pockmarks, golden light) is vivid and POV-filtered, yet the workshop’s floating instability never constrains the final action; it could be any perilous perch. The key ring charm functions as micro-setting and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or drown—is signaled early and escalates via oxygen debt. One meaningful tightening: last match of pockmarks under fading consciousness. Cost is visceral (collapse, gasp) but external rather than foreclosing a future path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges through the statue’s flawed surface and the mentor’s legacy, culminating in the earned insight that brokenness holds value. Avoids overt moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward summary uplift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person limited voice; perceptual signature shows in “quilted memories” and “acid sea churning.” No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Occasional cadence drift into poetic repetition but never obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control, high information density; figurative language is purposeful. Minor scaffold: “creaked and groaned” repeated. No mixed metaphors. Final image is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and breathless decoding under existential pressure. The statue-as-map conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
