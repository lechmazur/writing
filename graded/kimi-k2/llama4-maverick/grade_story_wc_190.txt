<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “fluidly logical” remains a label rather than a felt trait. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the operator’s choices are smooth, frictionless. The final smile is earned but carries no visible cost. Character reads as serene archetype rather than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silence vs. sound deepens through repeated drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—the terrace bathed in hush—yet the cost is only atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vial stills, but the operator’s stake never narrows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered and filters every perception. Micro-setting (storm glass vial) constrains no choice but recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; light and water guide mood. Spatial choreography is seamless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach silence to comfort”—is declared early but never tested; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is ambient, not causal. The operator’s agency is observational; no reversal or trade-off occurs. Cost is atmospheric, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges through imagery rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext is present in the vial’s stilling. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is gentle rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-anchored. Syntax flows with the water’s rhythm; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but sustained. Perceptual signature is serene, slightly monotonous; stress does not modulate cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, occasionally lush; one mixed metaphor (“vaulting hush”) but clarity intact. No loops or scaffold. Information density is high; sentences multitask. Rhythm supports mood; minor overwriting in “mesmerizing liquid that swirled and eddied.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise of a floating prism terrace as silence-sanctuary is fresh. Execution leans on familiar lyric meditation tropes; risk is muted. Specificity of storm glass and gondola helps, yet the arc feels inevitable rather than surprising. Transformation is gentle, not bold.</comment>
