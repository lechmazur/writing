<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “intimately aloof” is asserted rather than embodied in a single decisive choice. The promise to herself remains a told motivation; no micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of keeping it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final canvas crystallizes the stake of “temporary eternity” with felt cost. Causality is loose—wrong turn into oasis feels coincidental—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern of painted moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sea, cave, and studio are vividly sketched; the luminescent moss and cracked mirror act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; environment guides her brush and her retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty—is signaled early and re-weighted at closure. Escalation is gentle; the oasis deepens the stake rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (exposure of hidden world) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of “temporary eternity” emerges through repeated acts of painting; no explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in the tension between revelation and concealment, but the insight feels slightly generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through artistic priority. No dialogue; free-indirect style stays clean. Occasional lyrical drift but never obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory; minor loops (“as she worked…”) and elevated diction in spots, but no artifacts near closure. High information density; sentences often do two jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar artist-seeks-transcendence arc, but the fusion of cracked-mirror catalyst with hidden cave oasis offers fresh inflection. Risk is moderate; execution is polished rather than daring.</comment>
