<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives (“to learn why some echo”) are stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, and the final stance—continuing the quest—lacks visible cost. The shell’s warmth is felt, yet it never forces a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: Aria absorbs lingering echoes and chooses to keep listening. However, the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening—her song “weaving truth”—is described rather than enacted; the cost is only implied. Orientation is clear, but causality between song and revelation remains soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The serpentine nexus, starlight, and reed-blown air are vividly rendered and filtered through Aria’s perception. Yet the setting does not physically constrain her choices; it serves as mood more than obstacle. The shell’s warmth is the only object that charges the final image, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some echo—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure intensifies via the song’s spell, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed or price visibly paid. The final deepening is more resonance than tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of relational echoes emerges implicitly from the song’s effect on listeners. The final silence offers a resonant reconfiguration, yet the piece flirts with overt statement (“truth beyond everyday lives”). Complexity is present but not fully embodied in choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The voice is consistently lyrical, with rhythmic control and a perceptual signature attuned to “whispers of the land.” No dialogue appears; the prose sustains its cadence without monotony. Occasional elevated diction (“reed-blown melancholy”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely loops. Some phrases (“webs of intrigue,” “universe hummed its secret song”) risk repetition, but none stall momentum. Density is high; every sentence advances image or mood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of canyon singer, seashell oracle, and cosmic hum feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy templates. The concept of relational echoes as literalized song is non-obvious and coherent. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode.</comment>
