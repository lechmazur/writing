<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kaito’s grief is embodied through lantern-craft and origami, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“luminous torment”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The final release of the crane earns a micro-choice with cost, yet the causal link between polishing glass and emotional unfolding feels asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lantern and crane layers density until the closing image reweights grief into radiance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief “unfolds like lotus petals”—with felt cost, though the basilica remains ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating tea garden and lantern filigree anchor early; the glass basilica’s glint reappears to charge the final longing. Micro-setting of silk threads and misty depths constrains movement and mood, integrating sensory detail with emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting grief into light—intensifies via gem-polishing and crane-folding; pressure tightens once when Kaito releases the crane. Cost is lyrical rather than tangible, slightly blunting escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing sorrow into beauty emerges through craft imagery; no explicit moralizing. Final image of unfolding lotus reconfigures grief without tidy resolution, inviting lingering reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Kaito’s artisan perception; rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional soft-focus phrases (“poignant reflection”) edge toward overwriting but do not stall momentum. Strong cadence and sensory specificity keep the beat alive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Floating-island lantern craft feels fresh; grief-into-light trope is reanimated through gem-polishing and origami cranes. Slight risk of familiar lyric fantasy, but specificity of tools and setting lifts it above template.</comment>
