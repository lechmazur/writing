<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; “luminous doubt” is stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—choices are reported, not dramatized. The final vanishing feels unearned because her earlier hesitation never crystallizes into a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the monsoon arrives, memories are “safe,” but the cost is diffuse. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tending seed + interpreting dreams tightens toward rain. Orientation is clear, yet the decisive change lacks a palpable forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ridge in bloom is rendered with selective, sensory strokes—“sweet scent,” “warm sunlight”—that mirror Aria’s mood. Micro-setting (seedling, soil) constrains her daily labor, but the environment never materially limits her choices; it mostly serves as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect cultural memory before monsoon—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via iterative dream-interpretation montage, yet each beat feels interchangeable; no single tightening moment forces a trade-off or visible loss. Agency is diffuse, cost abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-fragile-ecology emerges through imagery rather than statement. Final image of sapling “thriving” in rain offers quiet reweighting, but the ambiguity (“for now”) feels more decorative than charged. Subtext is present yet thin; no counter-reading complicates the nostalgia.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with gentle rhythmic rise and fall matching seasonal cadence. Perceptual signature is lightly whimsical—“empirically whimsical” itself is a label—but diction stays within Aria’s plausible register. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, though occasional soft filler (“gentle hum of insects,” “vibrant landscape in bloom”) pads rather than propels. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph drifts into slightly elevated summary, dulling the last beat’s edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy-memory-guardian trope is refreshed by dream-interpretation method and botanical metaphor, yet the beats remain familiar. Specificity of “knowledge fruit seed” helps, but the arc could transplant to any pastoral-fantasy island without deep alteration. Risk is moderate, payoff gentle.</comment>
