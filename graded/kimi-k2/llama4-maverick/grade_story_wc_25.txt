<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is present but generic (“thrill of excitement,” “sense of satisfaction”) rather than embodied contradiction; the worker’s expertise in reading tracks is asserted but never tested under pressure. Motivation to prove whispers > shouts is stated early yet does not visibly shape micro-choices; the final whispered encounter feels coincidental rather than earned. No felt cost or renunciation closes her arc; she simply leaves with souvenirs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure is a soft thematic echo rather than a decisive change: the stranger whispers, the worker smiles, stakes remain unchanged. Causal chain is loose—maps, key, coin do not narrow options or exact price. Drive lens drifts between situational mood piece and causal quest without committing; final image does not reweight prior material. Orientation is clear, but closure lacks cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is vividly sketched—“salt and rust,” “flickering lights,” “shadows cast by the storm”—and the geomagnetic interference grounds the timeframe. However, setting functions mostly as backdrop; containers do not physically constrain choices or shape the final beat. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, yet the environment never becomes an active obstacle or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is declared but never materially tested; no escalation forces a trade-off. Pressure remains static; the stranger’s whisper is happenstance, not a consequence of her tactics. Agency is observational rather than decisional; no visible price is paid. One mild tightening occurs when she enters an unexplored sector, but it does not alter options or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet persistence versus overt force emerges implicitly through motif, yet the story spells it out in the final paragraph (“quietest voices that traveled the farthest”), blunting subtext. Resonance is present but not deepened by character cost; the insight feels asserted rather than discovered. Ambiguity is mild, complexity modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, with a restrained, observational texture fitting a maintenance worker’s practical gaze. Sensory filtering is character-specific—she notices tracks, graffiti, metal glints. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Dialogue is minimal but natural when it appears; the stranger’s whisper lands with indirection. Rhythm is steady, occasionally elevated toward lyricism without breaking stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“chorus of restless spirits”) skirts purple but stays within atmospheric bounds. Information density is solid; sentences advance image or motion. No typos or tense slips. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) do not accumulate. Final third remains artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—geomagnetic storm inside a container labyrinth—offers a fresh micro-setting, yet plot beats (found map, mysterious key, stranger’s whisper) follow familiar quest templates without inversion. Specific details (zodiac coin, graffiti) add texture, but the emotional arc is generic. Risk is moderate; no structural daring beyond atmospheric mood.</comment>
