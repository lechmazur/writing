<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“prism-minded,” “latent blaze”), but choices remain largely exploratory; the final beat carries cost yet feels more discovered than earned by prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves with knowledge and burden—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, though the grotto’s rules are asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s damp stone, inverted gravity, and clandestine glow are selective and atmospheric; the chamber’s faint glow constrains the final discovery, nearly earning the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover forgotten combinations—tightens once when the doodle becomes a map; cost is felt in the reluctant exit, but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of vigilance emerges through concrete particulars (serpent-seed map, inverted gravity) without sermon; final image of the latent blaze reweights earlier motifs with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through the archivist’s perceptual signature; no head-hop, no register drift, and patterned diction (“clandestinely luminous”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“threshold effects,” “repository of forgotten knowledge”) stays within the archivist’s lexicon and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by the gravity-inversion mechanic and serpent-seed cartography; synthesis feels specific to this voice, though not radically unprecedented.</comment>
