<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior monologue is vivid (“fractured grace”) and her suppressed sentimentality shapes the final beat of endurance; yet her amorality is asserted more than dramatized, and an abstract label (“amoral philanthropist”) dilutes specificity at the outset.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: intensifying sonic detail (thunder rising, water roar) tightens urgency and culminates in a Charged Poise—she stands amid the renewed flat holding the egg, renouncing the next move. Orientation is crisp and the on-page reconfiguration carries cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Salt flat’s cracked geometry literally underfoot mirrors the social rupture she repairs; sensory filters (dry crunch at sole, mineral sting in the rain) track with emotional pressure. Weather evolves from portent to active force, integrating with her choices. Micro-setting serves closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—releasing the waters to answer extinction’s echo—is signaled early and escalated through mounting thunder and rising dust. Pressure tightens one notch toward Charged Poise; cost is felt in her exposed stance and uncertain post-storm future. No reversal beyond the climatic release, but tension holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of “restoration through amoral means” is emergent in images of egg-as-custody and diverted floods returned. Resonant ambiguity is earned—not preached—yet final sentences edge toward thematic paraphrase (“preserve the echo”), damping subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Third-person narration is steady, slightly elevated, and remains focalized in her body and perception. Occasional template cadence (“As she…” ×3) modestly dulls rhythmic punch; diction mostly retains its own skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Images are kinetic and compressed (“brittle, fractured sound,” “lapping … like an offering”); metaphor clusters mostly pattern-teach the escalating return of life. Scaffolding near-duplicate clauses are minor and do not reach the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Synthesizes eco-restoration and noir philanthropism into a fresh parable without sermon. Egg, map, drought, and storm intertwine organically; nothing swaps easily without breaking the whole concept.</comment>
