<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her fingers trace the fresco, she “tucks the fragment into her bag”—and her contradictory impulses (abandonment vs. rediscovery) are embodied in the exposed film she both carries and finally uses. The final choice to leave the mural to the fog is earned by prior beats and carries a visible cost: relinquishing permanence for transient joy. Minor slips: “pensive mirth” edges toward label-speak and the knowledge network is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural glows, the orchard seems reborn, and Lena walks away with “wonder and peace” that reweights her earlier emptiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image crystallizes the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the irreversible surrender of the art to decay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail—“gnarled branches,” “morbid perfume”—that constrains movement and mood. The fog functions as both literal obstacle and thematic veil, tightening the final choice to abandon permanence. Micro-setting (the fresco fragment) charges the closure when it glows within the mural. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightened once: the act of displaying the mural in the ruins forecloses any chance of conventional preservation. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the deepening sensory density reweights the stake effectively. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the cost is the artwork’s inevitable erosion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between creation and impermanence; the final image of colors seeping into the trees offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in the exposed film’s transformation—abandoned past becomes luminous present. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Lena’s perceptions; diction is painterly yet precise—“shimmering curtain of color,” “haunting harmony.” No POV leakage or register drift. The prose’s rhythmic rise and fall mirrors her emotional arc, culminating in the quiet cadence of the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; figurative language is purposeful, never purple. Minor scaffold: “the fog swirled around her, as if drawn to the colors” could trim two words, but the image advances atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. High information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fusion of fresco fragment, exposed film, and light-painting feels fresh; these elements are synthesized rather than listed. The orchard-as-atelier trope is transformed through Lena’s specific practice and the irreversible surrender of the mural. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyrical closure rather than a dramatic reversal, and it pays off.</comment>
