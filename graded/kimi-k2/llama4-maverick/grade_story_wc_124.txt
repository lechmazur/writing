<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative but static; her grief is declared rather than embodied in micro-choices. The “aromatically cautious” trait is stated repeatedly yet never constrains a visible action or trade-off. The final peace feels unearned because no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the UV reveal deepens pattern and cadence, culminating in a Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by ~90 words. However, the decisive reconfiguration (“the greenhouse had become a catalyst for her own transformation”) is asserted rather than dramatized, softening cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered—scent, light, and shadow interleave with Elara’s perception. The UV-lit petals act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the vial’s placement and glow are tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory’s hold on Elara—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: UV patterns intensify sensory density. Yet no visible trade-off or narrowing of options occurs; grief is experienced, not tested, so cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s bittersweet power emerges through scent and light imagery rather than statement. The empty vial’s final glow offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting. Avoids explicit moralizing, though the insight feels slightly pre-packaged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to fragrance and luminosity. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional soft-focus phrasing (“sense of awe wash over her”) dilutes immediacy but does not rupture texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory-rich, but redundancy creeps in: “wash over her” appears twice, and “memories that threatened to overwhelm her” restates prior beats. No loops obscure closure, yet density could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The extinct-plant greenhouse as grief engine is fresh, and the UV-reveal pattern feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the lantern-broker occupation remains ornamental, reducing risk. A stronger synthesis would integrate her trade into the stakes.</comment>
