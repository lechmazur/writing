<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract “urge” and “purpose” rather than embodied contradiction; the moment she decides to “unfasten the anchors” lacks a visible, specific cost on the page, so the final stance feels announced rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise (“eternal instant”) that reweights the premise, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the cost is only implied; the causality between touching the lens fragment and the final resolve is more atmospheric than sequential, so the tightening is felt but not sharply legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is richly sensuous and spatially anchored; the fragment itself becomes micro-setting that constrains Lena’s grip and gaze, charging the final image. A hairline slip: “city rooftops” remains slightly generic, preventing the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking overlooked histories—surfaces late and is never tested in a concrete beat; pressure escalates atmospherically but no option is foreclosed, so the tightening is textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring silenced histories emerges organically from imagery, yet the final paragraph edges into explicit articulation (“she would weave a new narrative”), blunting subtext and capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, consistent, and perceptually specific; patterned cadence (“elusively tangible,” “eternal instant”) is taught early and paid off. Minor register drift toward oratory in the last lines keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense, but occasional stacked metaphors (“canvas waiting to be filled with the stories she was destined to tell”) dilute clarity; no loops or scaffolds, yet overwriting nudges the score down.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The between-worlds translator premise and lens-as-key conceit feel fresh, synthesizing mystic market tropes into a resonant whole; risk-taking is moderate, not boundary-pushing, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
