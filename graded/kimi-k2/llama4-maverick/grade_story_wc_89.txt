<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is poetic but generic; her “reluctant metamorphosis” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. Aria’s drive is clear, yet the emotional cost of the ritual on Lyra is summarized, not embodied. The beasts’ chorus functions as scenic backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra’s expanded perception—but the causal chain from fortune → ritual → metamorphosis is asserted rather than tested. The “paradoxically steady” beat is told, not shown, blurring the decisive change. Orientation is clear, yet the lens drifts between causal and accumulative without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s moonlit lantern-fruit and spice-scented air are vivid and selective, filtering through Lyra’s perception. However, the setting never physically constrains choices; it serves as atmospheric canvas rather than tactical obstacle. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes are declared—re-forge a bond, undergo metamorphosis—but pressure plateaus once the ritual begins; no tightening choice or cost alters tactics. The climax relies on cosmic spectacle rather than a narrowed option or forfeiture. Agency is largely ceremonial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation through communion with death emerges implicitly via image and ritual, avoiding overt statement. Yet the final paragraph drifts toward abstract assertion (“wonder…mysteries beyond the veil”), softening the earned resonance. Subtext is present but not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and sensorily anchored. Free-indirect texture suits Lyra’s mythic register; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“cosmic intimacy”) risks purple but stays within fairy-tale idiom. Rhythm modulates with ritual crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with strong sensory specificity. Minor loop: “fragrance…fragrance” repetition and stacked abstract nouns (“cosmic harmony,” “cosmic intimacy”) slightly dilute density. No line-level artifacts impede clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale orchard, beast-whisperer, and post-phoenix era combine into a fresh mythic frame. Yet the ritual mechanics and metamorphosis arc echo familiar necromantic tropes without transformative twist. Specificity of lantern-fruit and spice scent adds local color.</comment>
