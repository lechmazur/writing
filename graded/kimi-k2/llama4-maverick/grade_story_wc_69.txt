<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain static; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics or forecloses a path. The “expectantly resigned” stance is stated, not dramatized through action. Closure is a mood, not an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of stillness and rosette imagery deepens toward a Charged Poise. Yet the decisive reconfiguration is atmospheric, not causal; no concrete cost is legible on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn leaves are vividly filtered through Emilia’s musical priorities; the zither-as-micro-setting constrains her tactile choices. However, the environment never actively narrows options or supplies a resource that alters the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving harmony amid vanishing arts—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle; pressure remains static. No tightening choice or trade-off is dramatized; the final image reiterates rather than reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-difference emerges organically from imagery and method, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet the conceptual repricing is gentle; the rosette’s final glint reconfirms rather than reconfigures the premise, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm and selective sensory detail; POV remains stable and character-specific. Occasional elevated diction (“traveled stillness”) risks register drift but stays within Emilia’s musical lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with purposeful variation in sentence length. Minor paraphrase loops (“sense of…”) and soft filter verbs slightly dull immediacy; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing-arts elegy with choral pedagogy, anchored in tactile zither detail. Risk is modest; premise could transplant to another art form without structural loss. Specificity of rosette pattern offers a memorable visual hook.</comment>
