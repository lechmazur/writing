<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is consistent—“ordinary magic” refracts through small, tangible gestures. Eli arrives as catalyst, not character, leaving emotional charge uneven. The baby curl is nicely knotted to vocation, but Eli’s wonder lands more told than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the eclipse pattern builds atmospheric pressure whose final crystallization counts as Earned Stasis under poetic logic. No single beat creates reversal; instead, tonal density gathers until the closing chord reweights the moment. Closure is legible and feels paid for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is sketched from inside Aria’s perception—cool eclipse air, guitar timbre in her lap. Landscape guides mood without ever dictating choice; therefore setting constrains indirectly, not materially. Sensory palette vivid, but causal constraint absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single escalating stake: Aria must “link” Eli to wonder before totality ends. Tension rises through accumulating sensory density rather than choice narrowing. Price registers as momentary fragility rather than forfeiture; visible cost is oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through recurrent objects (curl) and rituals (song), culminating in a quiet afterglow. Final paragraph tacks too close to overt thematic statement—but resonance survives. Complexity feels sincere, not packaged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close, consistent perceptual signature: hush, rustle, hum, golden re-emergence. Syntax modulates from loose pastoral cadences to tighter peak sentences under eclipse’s hush. Vocabulary stays within lyrical reach, never grandiose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lines skim smoothly; occasional filler phrases (“the world seemed to melt away”) slightly blunt specificity. Strong rhythmic control at closure, no mechanical repetition. Small surplus modifiers keep this slightly shy of compression purity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Combines music therapy, eclipse ritual, souvenir baby curl, and understated childhood wonder into understated fabric. Core motifs are familiar, but synthesis feels specific to tone rather than derivative. A quiet angle handled gracefully, not groundbreaking but fresh enough.</comment>
