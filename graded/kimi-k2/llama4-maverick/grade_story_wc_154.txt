<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael's interior is vivid—glimpses of war-zones flash but translate into present ache—yet the "shrewdly innocent" trait appears only as label until final moments. The micro-choice—coral fragment still clutched as vision blurs—grounds her earned shift from knotting memories to releasing them. Emotional contradiction lacks embodiment in real time; tension is more recounted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single continuous mist-clad scene holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; closure is Earned Stasis as Kael yields to anesthetic, leaving coral in hand "pulse of soft light"—felt cost legible. Cause/effect chain is intact: cast decryption → shared anxiety surfaced → renunciation → acceptance. Orientation anchors early; only minor time dilation under anesthesia, within tolerance. Closure stands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Twilight atrium with mist drifting is specific and luminous; the coral itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Spatial cues tight: cast within arm's reach, operating table, coral fragment. Sensory hierarchy favors dwindling light and blurred vision—fitting anesthesia but slightly underuses aural/tactile pressure. Overall vivid, selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: re-grafting memory onto lingering wounds. Pressure tightens once: decrypted cast links translator's trauma to the child's hope, narrowing options to acquiescence under anesthetic. Agency here is endurance/acceptance, not act; price is the surrender of control. Causality intact under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared resilience vs. personal war wounds emerges from coral's repeated glow and mirrored cast-scrawls; closure crystallizes hope across wounds without spelling it. Final image—mist lifting with anesthetic—non-literal, quietly reweights stakes. Avoids moralizing but still leans on "new meaning graft" abstractions—small slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic lyricism that mirrors anesthesia descent: elongation and lapping cadences echoing waves. POV remains tight in Kael’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction ("lotus-hearted") is consistent with translator’s cerebral distance. Filter verbs minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences alternate compression with lyric drift, mirroring mental haze; only a few near-duplicate stems ("the mist swirled… the mist deepened"). Fresh metaphors but none obstructing clarity. Closing coral pulsing image lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>War-zone translator decrypting child trauma via coral fragment is a fresh intersection of frames—not seen widely—but risk is moderate. Brain coral as living metaphor for scar-tissue growth offers specific inflection. Transformation lies in translator giving herself permission via child’s hope; synthesis feels integrated but doesn’t push radical edge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Kael’s linguistic decoding of the cast directly rewires her inward translation: “Kael’s own heart begin to unknot.” One clear causal move; translator identity shapes every step.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>
Fragment appears at start, reappears at every beat of reflection, and pulses in the final image. Its reweighting from mere trinket to living symbol reconfigures Kael’s stance; removal collapses closure.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>
Shared anxieties steer the plot: the cast’s fears become Kael’s mirror; this reciprocity forces her acquiescence. Concept drives the only escalation beyond static introspection.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</question><grade>
“Shrewdly innocent” is invoked once but never acted: translator never performs a guileless ploy. It colors voice but lacks embodied choice; low causal weight.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>
The knot-unknotting motif recurs and literalizes on the final line; the move is tied to memory release forced by deciphering process. Cannot swap verb without gutting progression.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>
Decoding mechanics explicitly named as the hinge move that converts child’s garbled hope into Kael’s catharsis: “using her skills as a translator” mid-scene to pivot plot.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>
Mist-twilight atrium frames emotional isolation and gradual blur, but setting itself exerts no tight constraint; scene could relocate and logics remain. Provides mood not tactical pressure.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>
Anesthetic clock is present through sentences: “starting to take hold… took hold… anesthetic washed over her.” Countdown directly curtails Kael’s choices, forcing renunciation.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>
Drive survives as a sustained interior want: grafting new meaning onto wounds shapes the entire reflection arc. Internal desire is dramatized in yielding to the child-message, exact price felt in surrender.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>
“Lotus-hearted ache” is repeated and modulates toward healing, anchoring tone. Reprise at closure re-charges it as bittersweet peace rather than stagnant pain.
