<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and consistent; the mapkeeper’s tactile engagement with the echo chamber stone and ice cracks shows micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) is clear and intensifies, culminating in earned stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the energy beings remain abstract, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation anchors within 120 words. Causal linkage holds: because she studies cracks → infers resonance → conjures bloom of hush → energy beings adjust. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the caves settle into “hammered repose” with felt cost—her ongoing vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Harmonic caves, echo chamber stone, and ice cracks are vivid, selective, and filtered through POV. The stone’s glow and the shift to “gentle luminosity” constrain the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restore balance”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: cacophony → bloom of hush. Agency is cognitive (examine, conjure) and effective; cost is the perpetual tending implied at the end. No external antagonist, but internal/external stakes interweave cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmony-through-attention emerges from action and image, never stated. Subtext resides in the shift from “cacophony” to “hammered repose.” Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Some abstraction in energy beings weakens thematic specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is tactile and resonant. Syntax and diction remain consistent, with purposeful modulation during the bloom (“gently luminous,” “hammered repose”). No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“storm of vibrations,” “bloom of hush”) are coherent and purposeful. High information density without overwriting. Final cadence satisfies the ear.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—acoustic ecology tended by a mapkeeper—feels fresh. Tropes of mystical caves and energy beings are grounded in sensory specificity. The bloom-of-hush concept is non-obvious and grows organically from the ice-crack method. Risk is moderate; payoff is resonant.</comment>
