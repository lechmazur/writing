<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her “shielded openness” is dramatized through bodily tension and micro-choices like “straining to detect even the slightest variation.” The final renunciation (“she knew that she would return”) carries felt cost, but the arc leans on summary rather than a decisive on-page beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation is swift and stable. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map “now seemed whole” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of attention deepens rather than pivots—so one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault and henge stones are rendered through Elara’s cartographer’s gaze; damp earth scent and shifting light constrain her focus and pacing. The micro-setting (torn map edge) literally marks the threshold and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the henge’s silence—tightens via iterative observation; no external antagonist needed. The cost is opportunity/time rather than a visible forfeiture, so pressure is textural but coherent under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening to silence emerges through concrete action; the whispered chapel remains subtextual, reweighted at closure. No moralizing—final resonance is imagistic rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature (“cartographer’s art gave way to speculation”) is consistent. Rhythm modulates with rain cadence; no dialogue, so voice purity is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, sensory, and propulsive; occasional soft filler (“she felt a sense of awe”) is minor. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing archival video analysis with neolithic mysticism is fresh; the whispered chapel trope is grounded in Elara’s empirical gaze. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
