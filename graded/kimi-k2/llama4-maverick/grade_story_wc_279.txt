<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward therapy-speak (“unlearning,” “discover meaning in the mess”) without embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are present—altering the mandala, clutching the tile—but stakes feel abstract; no visible cost or relationship crucible on page. Endurance earns mild resonance yet remains emotionally diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mandala’s completion crystallizes a new stance under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose—tile flake arrives by chance—but pattern break reweights perception with lilac unease as felt cost. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and damp stone are vividly filtered through the artist’s tactile attention; whispering gallery hum charges the final hush. Micro-setting (tile flake, mandala sand) constrains the last gesture. Selective sensory detail supports tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning amid internal chaos—is signaled early and tightens through mandala’s emergent pattern. Escalation is textural, not causal; pressure deepens via lilac unease rather than narrowed options. Cost is felt but diffuse, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-fragment emerges organically from tile and mandala; no overt moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and pattern rather than statement. Final lilac light reweights prior motifs with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, sensory register consistent with focalizer. No dialogue; perceptual signature is distinct. Occasional elevated phrasing (“emergent hush,” “lilac unease”) feels stylized yet coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; occasional loops (“the mandala was a reflection…”) repeat without adding pressure. Metaphors stay coherent; no line-level artifacts in closure beat. Density is high, momentum steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artist, whispering grotto, and emergent mandala transcends stock “artist seeks self” trope. Specificity of tile flake and lilac unease lend memorable inflection. Risk is moderate; transformation feels earned.</comment>
