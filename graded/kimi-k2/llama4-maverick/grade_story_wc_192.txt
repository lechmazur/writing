<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is embodied (“melancholy mood,” “heart ached”) and the contradictory impulse—yearning to reconnect yet fearing the cost—drives the final choice. However, the “teach suffocating to breathe” motive is stated more than dramatized, and the micro-choice to revive the flame feels slightly under-motivated given the prior isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper steps through the revitalized threshold, accepting the cost of leaving isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each descent beat thickens the shadows until the final cadence shift. The only drag is a brief orientation wobble at the start; who/where is clear by line 3, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s ashen charcoal palette and starlight are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the keeper’s mood. The doorknocker ring and flickering flame function as micro-settings that constrain choice. A hairline slip: “loaded emptiness” leans abstract, blurring the sensory edge at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the sanctuary’s survival—tightens once when the keeper chooses to rekindle the flame, paying the cost of re-engagement. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density rather than causal reversals; the final image crystallizes the trade-off. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: isolation as both refuge and slow death. The sanctuary’s rebirth reframes the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the doorknocker’s shift from “skeletal” to “beacon” is elegant, though the phrase “teach suffocating to breathe” edges toward thematic label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-anchored; sensory filtering is biased to the keeper’s tender, meticulous nature. Rhythm modulates with descent—longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments at the flame. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional poetic layering (“dark tentacles,” “loaded emptiness”) flirts with overwriting but stays within pattern. One paraphrase loop near the middle (“the keeper’s presence was a catalyst…”) dulls momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The shadow-keeper reviving a sanctuary of forgotten darkness is a fresh angle on the hermit’s return. The transformation of the doorknocker from symbol of isolation to invitation is specific and earned. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids gimmickry but doesn’t push formal boundaries.</comment>
