<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the parachute buckle hints at past stakes yet never forces a present micro-choice. The “watcher’s burden” is asserted rather than dramatized in a decision with visible cost. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the cost is gestural, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise. However, the causal linkage between star-chart revision and trust preservation is implied rather than demonstrated, and the cost of her vigilance is only named, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The nocturnal arbor is rendered with tactile specificity—wooden slats, whisper-thin wires, cloud-dwelling air—and subtly guides Lyra’s constrained motion. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (preserve peer trust) is signaled early; pressure deepens through iterative revision of data, but the tightening beat is more textural than causal. No visible price is exacted on the page, so escalation feels moderate rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of vigilance and trust emerges through Lyra’s iterative labor and the arbor’s hush, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image reweights the buckle as emblem of unending duty, but the conceptual cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control and selective diction that matches the nocturnal hush. POV remains stable and perceptually specific; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional figurative layering (“diamonds scattered across velvet”) is purposeful. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies to match scene tempo. Minor filter verbs appear but do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Cloud-top star-mapping is fresh, and the arbor’s fragile lattice offers a non-obvious crucible. The parachute buckle as talisman of perpetual vigilance is a specific inflection. Risk is moderate; premise is not radically transformed but feels particular to this voice.</comment>
