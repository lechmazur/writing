<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The advisor’s interiority is abstract (“map of emotions,” “deep understanding”) rather than embodied; the old man’s signing supplies the only concrete micro-choice. Motivation is stated (“translate silence into music”) but never pressured by contradiction or cost. Relationship remains static; no status shift or visible price is paid at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the harbor is “forever tuned,” but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on the page. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; the lens holds, yet the decisive change feels gifted rather than earned through prior beats. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor is vividly sketched and filters through the advisor’s selective attention (“luminosity taking on a new quality”). The vintage camera returns as a charged image at closure, reweighting memory. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—is signaled early and deepened through the signing sequence. Pressure escalates via the crowd’s gathering hush, but the final shift is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of options; no visible price is exacted from the advisor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-music emerges organically from the signing bridge; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the camera’s empty lens and the wordless gratitude. Final image reweights silence as enduring music without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“tuning the atmosphere to a different frequency”). No dialogue; narration sustains a quiet charisma through rhythm and metaphor. Free-indirect texture remains stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“orchestrate them into a symphony”) fits the lyric mode. No loops or scaffold. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to”) do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise—translating silence into music via sign language—is fresh and grounded in the harbor vignette. Tropes of the mute sage and magical mentor are gently subverted by the advisor’s receptive rather than directive role. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
