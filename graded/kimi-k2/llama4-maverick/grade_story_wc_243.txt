<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is lyrical but generic; no contradictory impulses surface in-scene. Her single micro-choice—placing the locket away—does not foreclose a path with visible cost. Trait “gently thorough” is asserted, never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single twilight scene, orientation clear by 120 words. Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the archivist walks away having “captured a moment,” but the cost is abstract and off-stage. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early yet final reweighting feels mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jetty at twilight is vividly evoked—scent of flowers, lapping waves, fading light—and the locket photo functions as micro-setting that constrains attention. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and light evolve with the scene’s mood. However, environment never materially alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is declared early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. No escalation beyond deepening nostalgia; pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal. Closure lacks a felt price that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s persistence emerges through imagery rather than statement. Subtext is present but thin; the covenant’s meaning is gestured at rather than dramatized. Final image of the jetty blooming in darkness offers quiet resonance without conceptual repricing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with selective sensory attention that suits an archivist. Prose is smooth, occasionally lyrical, but syntactic patterns verge on repetitive (“the archivist… the archivist…”). No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clear and rhythmic, but mild loops appear (“the archivist’s work… the archivist’s work…”). Figurative language is restrained and coherent. No overwriting in peak beats; minor scaffold phrases keep it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—archivist preserving love via ecosystem notes—is fresh but not fully exploited. Tropes of nostalgic locket and twilight jetty are familiar; specificity of “walnut-ink” and “regenerated covenant” adds texture yet remains ornamental. No bold structural risk.</comment>
