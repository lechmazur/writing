<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s motivation is stated but never embodied in a concrete choice; her “lovingly venomous” intent remains abstract. The alchemist’s interiority is generic (“felt a shiver,” “sense of gratitude”) and lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. No micro-choice by either character visibly alters the relationship or stakes. The final beat is summary, not dramatized action with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft fade-out (“presence dissipated”) rather than a decisive change or charged poise; the debt is declared repaid but no on-page cost is felt. Causality is loose: the bead unlocks awakening off-stage, and the ghost’s guidance is asserted rather than shown. Orientation is clear, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern does not tighten meaningfully at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s luminescent orbs and scent of sandalwood/myrrh are vivid and consistent, filtering through the alchemist’s attention. Spatial anchors hold; the carved stone bead functions as micro-setting and focal object. However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image—its role is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—“unlock resonant awakenings”—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates; the bead’s activation resolves the conflict in one beat. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed. The ghost’s debt is thematic backdrop, not active antagonistic pressure that narrows the alchemist’s choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of trans-generational debt and transformation emerges implicitly through the ghost’s presence and the bead’s glow, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet the absence of a concrete cost or reconfiguration at closure limits resonance; the “mournful elation” is asserted rather than earned through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-ritual register appropriate to the endless-night greenhouse. Sensory specificity (“scent of sandalwood and myrrh,” “soft rustle of fabric”) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean and rhythmic, with selective sensory detail. Occasional mild scaffold (“seemed to shimmer,” “seemed to come alive”) slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors, but figurative language stays safe; no propulsive tightening in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of ghost-bride folklore with alchemical botany offers a fresh angle, and the “resonant awakening” concept is non-generic. Yet the execution leans on familiar spectral-guide tropes without a surprising turn; the bead’s function is conventional. Specificity of scent and light helps, but overall risk is moderate.</comment>
