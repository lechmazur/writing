<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the bell ringer’s curiosity and “texture of connection” remain thematic labels rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path with cost; the pilgrimage resolves into satisfied stasis without renunciation or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sound-making deepens until a final cadence shift (“music swelled…wonder and awe”). Closure is a Charged Poise, but the cost is only atmospheric; no concrete forfeiture is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Laboratory is sensuously anchored—“scent of old machinery,” “golden shadows”—and the carbide-lamp lens reappears as charged micro-setting. Yet the space never materially constrains the bell ringer’s tactics; it serves as mood more than obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is declared early but never tested by a narrowing choice; pressure is ambient rather than escalating. One soft tightening occurs when the lens is cleaned, yet no option is foreclosed and no price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection emerges organically through sonic imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing. Final image of “golden shadows” offers quiet resonance, but the conceptual repricing is mild—comfort outweighs challenge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and sensorily attuned; perceptual signature is strong (“soft focus lens, blurring the edges”). No dialogue, so no risk of register drift; compression and patterned elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with selective sensory detail. Occasional soft-focus abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “essence of the laboratory”) slightly dilute density, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” and prism-song bell ringer offer a fresh, synesthetic premise. The artificial pilgrimage concept is under-explored, preventing full transformation of trope, yet the sonic tapestry feels specific and memorable.</comment>
