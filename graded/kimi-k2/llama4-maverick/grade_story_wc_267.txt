<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The bellhop’s interiority is evocative but static; the “unpardonable silence” is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The single on-page choice—continuing to stand watch—does not visibly foreclose a path or incur new cost, so the arc feels circular rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis (the bellhop accepts the silence), but the causality is weak: the tightening of the piano bench bolt is thematically suggestive yet has no causal bearing on the bellhop’s stance. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of snow and stillness intensifies, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and snow are vividly rendered and filter through the bellhop’s sensory priorities; the “dusty spiral staircase” and discoloration anchor spatial logic. However, the setting never materially constrains the final choice; it serves as mood rather than crucible, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the silence is worth the safety—is declared early but never tested by a concrete beat; pressure remains atmospheric. The single micro turn (the figure tightening the bolt) is external and does not tighten the bellhop’s options or raise the cost of remaining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of silence as both burden and strength emerges through imagery rather than assertion, but the final paragraph’s explicit rumination (“they came to see that it was… a choice”) edges toward thematic echo, blunting subtext. The ambiguity is present but not charged with new conceptual cost at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose achieves a hushed, ecclesiastical cadence that suits the bellhop’s vocation; perceptual signature is consistent (“seraphically mundane”). Occasional register drift (“frostbitten hope”) and minor scaffold phrases (“the silence was still there, but…”) keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; selective sensory detail avoids checklist syndrome. However, repeated abstract phrasing (“sense of peace,” “sense of renewal”) and a few paraphrase loops dull momentum. No artifact appears in the closure beat, so the cap remains lenient.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fusion of monastic silence with a snowbound fortress is atmospheric, yet the core premise remains familiar—guardian choosing mute duty over self-expression. The piano bench bolt gesture is fresh but under-leveraged; the story does not transform the trope into inevitable insight.</comment>
