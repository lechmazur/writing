<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaito’s sorrow and regret are palpable, but interiority drifts into abstract “cerulean regret” rather than embodied contradiction. The lace-weaving ritual is a vivid micro-choice, yet the severance and loved one remain off-page abstractions, blunting relational stakes. Closure earns a modest renunciation, but the cost feels generalized rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; causal chain (find compass → weave lace → release compass) is legible. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: releasing the compass forecloses reunion and carries felt, if quiet, cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Minor drift into summary weakens tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The breezy, post-rain islet is evoked through salt scent, wet earth, and lapping waves; micro-setting (rock, shore) constrains Kaito’s ritual. Compass and lace function as charged objects that guide and then release memory. Details are selective and POV-filtered, though “cerulean” edges toward palette cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the lace pattern crystallizes the apology hue, forcing the choice to release the compass. Cost is present (letting go of the relic) but understated; escalation is single-note yet coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-tide emerges organically through compass and lace; no explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in the act of weaving silence into pattern and then surrendering it. Final image of the compass drifting seaward reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Avoids tidy resolution while remaining coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kaito’s slow, deliberate perception; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors his calm—measured, slightly elongated sentences that breathe with the breeze. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable connection,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register drift but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich; no loops or scaffold. Occasional soft modifiers (“gently,” “slowly”) could be pruned, but they fit the placid cadence. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph avoids sentimentality through concrete action (release into waves).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Ghost-ship compass and lace-weaving apology are fresh syntheses of maritime and domestic crafts. Memory-as-tide is familiar, but the color-of-regret conceit is particularized through the lace ritual. Risk is modest; story hews to quiet lyric rather than structural daring, yet feels internally inevitable.</comment>
