<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s pacifism is asserted, not dramatized—no moment forces her to choose between violence and peace—so the trait stays ornamental. The filial tension with the bounty-hunter father is off-stage; the sword is hung on the wall but never tests her. Interiority drifts into abstract labels (“sense of purpose,” “engraved quiet”) rather than embodied contradiction. Closure is a passive drift into sleep, not a renunciation that costs her anything visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated images of roses, stone, and sword layer toward a final hush. Yet no single beat tightens or forecloses a live option; the tower collapse, airship wreck, and visitor influx are all back-story exposition. Orientation is clear by word 60, but causality remains slack—no because/therefore chain pushes Aria to a decisive moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise (“tranquil blaze”) but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, desert roses, and repurposed sandbag planter are vivid, selective, and filtered through Aria’s cultivator gaze. Light, scent, and temperature are woven into action rather than catalogued. The micro-setting of the engraved stone in her palm late in the text reweights the quiet theme and satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial track stays clean; no floating rooms or prop teleportation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve oasis of peace—remains static; no external or internal force seriously threatens it. Visitors arrive, but they admire rather than test; the sword is never lifted; the tower rubble stays outside the dome. One micro-turn (stone becomes talisman) deepens texture yet alters no tactical choice. Pressure plateaus; escalation is decorative, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated quiet emerges organically from roses grown in wreckage, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the sheathed sword and the pink rose blooming from war debris. Final image of “tranquil blaze” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Could rise higher if a single moment forced Aria to pay for that quiet with something she values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aria’s cultivator perception; no head-hopping. Diction favors hortile precision (“ballast sandbag scrap,” “ballast sandbag scrap now repurposed”) and repeats key noun phrases to create incantatory rhythm—pattern taught early and paid off in final line. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory attention narrows under her professional bias. Voice remains distinct and consistent under the glass dome’s hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Occasional near-paraphrase (“sense of continuity,” “continuity she had worked to establish”) but loops are sparse and do not touch closure. Metaphors stay coherent—quiet literally engraved on stone. High information density: one sentence often performs description, interiority, and world-state update.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic pacifist florist is fresh, yet the piece avoids any risk that might complicate that premise—no antagonist, no scarcity, no moral trade-off. Repurposed airship ballast as planter is a lovely specific, but the story never lets the war past breach the dome. Feels like a safe oasis rather than a charged one; boldness is aesthetic, not dramatic. Transformation test: swap roses for orchids, dome for greenhouse, and arc is unchanged.</comment>
