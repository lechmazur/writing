<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers moved deftly… as if guided by an unseen force”), but the embroiderer’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no single micro-choice under pressure crystallizes the final stance. The final smile feels unearned because the stakes of the coup and the cost of the revelation are off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed chart “vibrates with an otherworldly energy” and the embroiderer knows their work is “only just beginning.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Cobalt observatory… crisp autumn air… eternal candle” anchor space and season early. The candle’s flame dances with the needle, then flares brighter at the end, charging the final image. Micro-setting (velvet cloth, workbench) constrains the embroiderer’s posture and rhythm, but the coup remains a distant abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel the conspiracies”—is declared early. Pressure escalates via temporal urgency (“days shortened… coup already on the horizon”), but the actual tightening choice is deferred; the embroiderer finishes the chart and steps back rather than acting. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge emerging through craft is coherent and emerges from the act of stitching. The final image of the chart as “a key that would unlock the mysteries” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Yet the lack of concrete consequence blunts the thematic aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the embroiderer’s tactile focus. Sentence rhythm modulates with the needle’s pace. Compression (“echoed silence”) is taught early and returns in the final line, earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and poetic yet clear; occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmer and glow in the candlelight”) flirt with overwriting but remain within pattern. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“stitching,” “pondering,” “unravel”) propel momentum. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The conceit of embroidery-as-codebreaking feels fresh; the galaxy chart as living conspiracy map is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure, and it pays off in the final charged poise. A touch more specificity on the coup’s nature would sharpen originality.</comment>
