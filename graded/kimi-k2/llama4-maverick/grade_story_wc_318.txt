<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maestro Elwes’s “mournfully eager” stance is vivid, but interiority stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene. His single on-page choice—pulling the cord—lacks visible cost or trade-off, so the Earned Stasis feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the household’s silence is reweighted into bittersweet resonance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the leaf-blower melody accumulates memory-whispers until laughter returns. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is more than backdrop—its acoustic properties literally enable the symphony and shape the final charged hush. Sensory detail is selective (worn grip, off-key wind) and filtered through Maestro’s ear. Micro-setting (leaf blower as instrument) constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the crescendo of summoned memories, but agency remains largely atmospheric; the laughter’s return feels bestowed by the setting rather than wrested through a costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of tending to the unspoken emerges through sound-memory rather than statement. The final “true haunting” reweights the tunnel from mausoleum to living archive without moralizing. Subtext resides in the shift from wail to lullaby.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control that swells and subsides like the music described. Perceptual signature is strong: Maestro “savors the silence,” hears walls “macerate” quiet. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and mostly propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“cacophony echoing… mournful melody… haunting tapestry”) risk purple overload. No loops or scaffold; final image is clean. Density high; minor register drift in “dormant laughter.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—leaf-blower symphony exorcising grief—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test passes: the household’s emotional archaeology depends on this exact conceit. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
