<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; “sculpt patience from impatience” is stated rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse surfaces in scene; the mapper’s resolve only intensifies. Final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moon-tracking and viaduct hum build density toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands as moon dips and hum crescendos, reconfiguring stakes. Cost is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and rain-slick viaduct are vividly rendered and filter through mapper’s gaze. Micro-setting (viaduct’s hum) constrains mood and signals timing, but does not directly alter her tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“patient revolution”—is declared early and escalates via moon-tracking ritual. Pressure tightens as viaduct hum intensifies, but the decisive turn is atmospheric rather than an actionable trade-off; cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges through imagery and cadence rather than statement. Final moonlit glow offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans on abstract cosmic linkage rather than grounded stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually anchored to the mapper. Syntax modulates with rising hum and wind. Occasional elevated diction (“unyoke themselves,” “patient revolution”) edges toward editorial rather than lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; sensory detail is selective. Minor loops—“the mapper knew,” “she felt”—recur without pattern payoff. No figurative muddle, but density could be sharpened in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fusion of moon-mapping, magnetic viaduct, and frozen sanctuary feels fresh and specific. Premise avoids stock dystopia; cosmic ritualism is grounded in tactile detail. Risk is moderate; payoff is atmospheric rather than revelatory.</comment>
