<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria’s motivation is stated repeatedly but never tested; no contradictory impulse or visible cost appears. The fossil is handled but never alters a choice. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle affirmation (“she was at peace”) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final cadence merely restates earlier wonder without deepening stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Vivid sensory selection—salt air, bioluminescent bloom—anchors POV and mood. Cave passages function as micro-settings that guide movement. However, no environmental constraint forces a costly choice, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to become the voice of the unknown”—remains abstract; no tightening trade-off or visible price is dramatized. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the final cavern spectacle complicates nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of bridging past and present lingers as mood rather than emergent insight. The fossil’s glow at the end restates rather than reweights meaning; ambiguity feels decorative, not charged.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature is lyrical, slightly repetitive. Syntax and diction suit a contemplative sensorial explorer. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but loops of “she felt,” “she knew,” and “the cave was” dull momentum. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mesmerizing display of bioluminescent organisms”) verge on purple without pattern pay-off.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Heat-mapping emotions as cartography is fresh, yet the concept stays ornamental. Post-hibernation world feels sketched rather than re-imagined; no rule or consequence unique to this premise surfaces.</comment>
