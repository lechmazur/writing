<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emilia’s embodied, tactile interiority is vivid and consistent, but her choices remain procedural rather than internally conflicted; no contradictory impulse or visible cost complicates the final success, so the arc feels competent rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone’s steady hover crystallizes the new harmony and carries felt cost in the fading mist. Causal chain is light—more Accumulative/Textural—but the lens holds and the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mist, fountain light, and depot acoustics are filtered through Emilia’s non-visual perception, creating a coherent micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image; spatial choreography is clean, though broader rail-yard geography remains impressionistic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the drone’s navigation—is signaled early and tightened once via the fountain test, but pressure is gentle; the ship’s departure is atmospheric rather than a complicating force, so escalation feels modest yet sufficient for the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between human touch and engineered precision emerges organically from Emilia’s tactile craft and the drone’s calibrated flight; final image of the hovering bird refracts the motif without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Emilia’s sensorium; rhythmic, tactile diction mirrors her blindness and artisan focus. No dialogue, so voice coherence is high; occasional soft-focus lyricism slightly dilutes immediacy but fits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, sensory, and largely free of loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. A few gentle abstractions (“heartbeat of industry”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan decoding drone navigation via water-light refraction is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the mist-bound depot and tactile craft create a memorable micro-world. Risk is modest—no structural experimentation—but specificity transforms familiar motifs.</comment>
