<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Asa’s dreamlessness is stated but never embodied; her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“her essence merging with the dune”) rather than contradictory impulse. The final re-solidification is a graceful Earned Stasis, yet the cost feels atmospheric rather than personal—she brushes sand away as if from a day at the beach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing dune’s zenith reweights the archive’s purpose and Asa’s guardianship. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification rather than because/therefore—taught early by the “occasionally everywhere” box and paid off in the swirling light. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune, chess clock, and archive form a micro-setting triad that constrains every beat; the clock’s reactivation literally changes the environment’s luminosity. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“soft, warm sand,” “fractured lullaby”). The final image of dawn over charred remains recharges the opening vista with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardian must nurture hidden sparks—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is Accumulative: shimmer intensifies, clock ticks, glow reaches zenith. One tightening beat when Asa kneels to restart the clock; cost is the blurring of her form, a visible forfeiture of bodily integrity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth from ash emerges through the dune’s luminous bloom against the burned world, never sermonized. The chess clock’s transformation from frozen symbol to living metronome reweights time itself. Final image of Asa walking away under dawn light offers quiet, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and taught early (“dreamless freight guard,” “fractured lullaby”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in calm moments, clipped fragments during clock reactivation. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Asa’s tactile, slightly numbed attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; only minor loops (“glowing dune” repeated twice in close succession). Metaphors stay coherent (“fractured lullaby” threads through). One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction sneaks in—but does not mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of quantum-physics diction with mythic desert rebirth feels fresh; the “divergent archive” avoids generic MacGuffin status by its omnipresence. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final luminous swirl. Could edge higher with sharper individuation of Asa’s dreamlessness.</comment>
