<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—“reef-shadow joy” and “half-sung lullaby” give texture—but the centuries-long span is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost of her final peace. Micro-choices (slipping the postcard back) are present yet feel ornamental; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The poet’s flaw (endless longing) is stated, not tested. Earned Stasis is gestured at, but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lullaby crystallizes her stance, and the postcard’s image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“blossom armistice” now internalized). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence tighten toward the final image. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. However, the centuries-long frame is summary, not dramatized pressure, so the cost is more elegiac than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The gargantuan shell and bioluminescent fungi are vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet’s exhausted awe; the postcard’s colors cut against the muted interior, charging the final image. Setting constrains choice—her exile is literal—yet the shell never evolves under pressure; it remains backdrop. Micro-setting (notebook, postcard) is handled tactilely. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmuting pain into beauty—is signaled early and tightened by the lullaby’s spell. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than overt action; the cost is conceptual (perpetual vigil). Escalation is lyrical, not causal; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (postcard’s arrival centuries ago) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as alchemy for grief emerges organically from the poet’s lullaby and postcard meditation. Subtext lives in gesture—the postcard slipped back between pages, fungi pulsing like an echo—never sermonized. Final image of “reef-shadow joy” offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; diction (“shyly unstoppable,” “photosynthesize pain”) is character-bound. Rhythm modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is distinct. Experimental elision (centuries compressed) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; figurative language is patterned rather than gratuitous. Occasional near-repetition (“across centuries of longing” echoed) but no loops that dull closure. Strong verbs and sensory nouns dominate. One mixed metaphor—“river of moonlight” beside “reef-shadow joy”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—artist exiled in fossil shell, sustained by postcard memory—feels fresh and specific. Trope of isolated creator is transformed through mollusk sanctuary and bioluminescent fungi. Risky lyric compression holds. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
