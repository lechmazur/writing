<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elys’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“musty scent,” “soft whisper”), but the mistake remains abstract and the final shift feels summary rather than dramatized. Empathy is asserted rather than shown constraining any micro-choice; no contradictory impulse collides in scene. The closure beat is a gentle acceptance rather than a costly renunciation, so the arc feels under-pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single continuous scene, clear orientation by line 5, closure lands as Charged Poise: Elys re-weights the invitation and the paradox, foreclosing avoidance with a felt but quiet cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten once at the slip of paper. No causality breaks; however, the “mistake” backstory is delivered in one reflective block that slightly dilutes present pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The library’s “unobtrusive façade,” lantern glow, and “worn leather binding” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elys’s hushed attention. The armchair and slip of paper act as micro-setting objects that constrain the final choice. Sensory detail is balanced and purposeful, never stalling momentum. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unearth wisdom in a past mistake—is signaled early and revisited at the end. Pressure tightens once when the message reframes the invitation, but the escalation is contemplative rather than consequential; no tangible resource or relationship is risked. The cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening, but stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of finding truth in contradiction emerges organically through the slip-of-paper payoff and the re-weighted invitation. Subtext operates in silence and gesture; no explicit moralizing. Final image of writing as “staying while leaving” offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a thesis. Slight abstraction around the original mistake keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elys’s perceptual signature: “dusty tomes,” “soft glow,” “enlarged tranquility.” Syntax is calm, bookish, matching the reclusive temperament. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which remains consistent. Occasional soft filter verbs (“Elys felt”) are minor.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“presence as unobtrusive as a whispered secret”). One paraphrase echo (“deep sense of comfort” / “deep sense of peace”) is negligible. Line-level craft supports the quiet accumulative design without artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The hidden-library premise and paradox motif are familiar, but the slip-of-paper twist and the “staying while leaving” conceit give a fresh inflection. Emotional specificity around Elys’s retreat feels lived-in. Risk is modest; no structural daring, but the synthesis is coherent and memorable.</comment>
