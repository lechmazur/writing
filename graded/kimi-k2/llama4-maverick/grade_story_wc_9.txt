<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interiority is evocative but remains largely observational; her “willing perplexity” is stated rather than enacted through risky choice. The hand-tracing memory and cracked saucer provide embodied emotion, yet no decisive micro-choice under pressure alters her stance—she simply accepts. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis, but the cost feels generalized rather than rooted in a specific, character-driven forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure is a single, continuous scene with one transition (memory flash), fitting the 600–800 word default. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “cloudbound repentance” crystallizes as acceptance of lost time. However, causality is more associative than because/therefore; the cracked saucer and hand-tracings mirror loss but do not force a narrowing of options. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is atmospherically vivid—mist, moon, ozone—yet functions more as mood than constraint. The dolls’ saucer and hand-tracing book act as micro-settings that do charge the final image: the crack reframes time’s fracture. Sensory selection is biased toward the cartomancer’s mournful attention; no spatial contradictions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost parental time—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via associative deepening (memory → saucer → book) rather than a narrowing choice; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The final acceptance carries conceptual cost but lacks a visible price paid in the present scene. Escalation is textural, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of cloudbound repentance emerges through image rather than statement: mist, cracked porcelain, fading handprints. Subtext operates in the silence between cartomancer and absent child. The ending’s reweighting—“lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories”—is resonant but slightly abstract; it avoids moralizing yet skirts sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific: “choking beauty,” “onyx-ink.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests—long, breathy sentences under moonlight, shorter fragments at the crack. No dialogue; no POV drift. The final cadence—“trail of cloudbound memories”—echoes the opening, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely repeats without payoff. Minor scaffold: “the cartomancer’s thoughts turned…” is a mild filter, but momentum holds. Rhythm breathes with beats; no loops or simultaneity errors. Opening and closing lines are sharply anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The fusion of cartomancy, parental grief, and cloud metaphors feels fresh, though “midnight glade above clouds” flirts with familiar fantasy imagery. The cracked saucer as temporal fracture is a specific, non-obvious inflection. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence remains intact.</comment>
