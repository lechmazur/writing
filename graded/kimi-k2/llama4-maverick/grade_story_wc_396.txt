<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the crystal’s reassembly is driven by a clear, escalating motive to “map empathy onto action.” The final choice—tucking the crystal against her heart—carries a visible cost (the burden of guardianship). Minor slack: the “courageous anomaly” label is asserted rather than dramatized in contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse adds density until the crystal’s reconstitution crystallizes stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing crystal reconfigures her role and the landscape’s breath. One smooth transition from orchard to lighthouse keeps scope tight. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensuous: frost-rimed grass, antique mirrors, shifting ice floes. The orchard and lighthouse constrain movement and supply the mirrors that enable the crystal’s repair. Final image of “branches etched like pen and ink” recharges the opening stillness. Micro-setting (the crystal itself) also guides the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guardian’s burden to keep balance—tightens as each mirror glimpse costs emotional exposure. One clear escalation: from finding fragment to reconstituting whole, with the price of perpetual vigilance legible in the final beat. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through the tactile act of reassembly, never sermonized. The crystal’s blue pulse becomes a non-literal answer to how empathy can steady a shifting world. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the landscape’s held breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “weighted breath before reply,” “delicate pen and ink drawing.” POV stays tightly anchored to the peacekeeper’s calmly intuitive filter. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with her quiet, sensory cognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “weighted breath”) skirts but avoids purple overload. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. One mixed metaphor—“map empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes (guardian, crystal, lighthouse) are transformed through sensory specificity and the unusual orchard-mirror mechanic. The “courageous anomaly” angle feels fresh because it is enacted, not labeled. Final reconfiguration of the crystal’s light onto the ice floes is an earned, non-obvious turn.</comment>
