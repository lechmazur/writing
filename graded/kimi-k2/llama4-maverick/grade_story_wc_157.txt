<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s motives are sketched—clandestine scholar, anti-tax rebel—but her interiority stays abstract (“spark of defiance” repeated). No embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; she gardens and watches. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows her weighing risk or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft thematic summary rather than a decisive change: the greenhouse “remains a sanctuary” and seeds “carry the message forward.” No on-page cost or reconfiguration; the stakes plateau. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence merely reiterates rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is evoked with humid scent and insect hum, anchoring who/where early. Yet it never constrains Lyra’s choices; she could garden anywhere. Sensory detail is vivid but decorative, not instrumental. Micro-setting (gourd plant) is present but doesn’t charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Central stake—evading thought-tax via coded gardens—is clear, but pressure never tightens. No reversal or trade-off; the message simply grows while gardeners remain oblivious. Agency is low: Lyra plants, then watches. Cost is asserted (“taxable thoughts”) but never dramatized on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question>
<comment>Theme of coded resistance to intellectual oppression emerges organically from premise. Subtext is mostly implicit, though final paragraph drifts toward overt statement. Resonance is moderate; the gourd seed’s dispersal offers a quiet reprise but lacks conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lyra with consistent perceptual filter (“gentle hum,” “subtle vibrations”). Diction is slightly elevated but coherent. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal texture is steady. Some lyrical repetition (“spark of defiance”) edges toward mantra.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but suffers from paraphrase loops (“message patterns… hidden language… coded messages”) and gentle filler (“As the days passed”). No line-level artifacts in closure, yet density is modest; many sentences do only one job.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—taxable thoughts resisted via garden steganography—is fresh and well-suited to flash length. Execution relies on familiar lyrical uplift rather than daring structure. Specificity of entomologist greenhouse adds texture, but overall feels like a polished variation rather than a bold leap.</comment>
