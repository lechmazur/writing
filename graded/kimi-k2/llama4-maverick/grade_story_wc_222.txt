<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moonwhisper’s interiority is consistent—curious, playful, dutiful—but never contradictory; no moment of simultaneous impulse. The pocket sundial is handled, yet its meaning is ornamental. The “sacredly playful” trait is asserted, not enacted under pressure. Closure is a success without visible cost, so no earned stasis or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a tidy success: swap pieces, sky heals, no felt price. Causal chain is linear and unthreatened; no tightening or option foreclosure. Orientation is clear early. Drive lens is Causal but the final beat lacks cost, so closure is legible yet lightweight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire, ozone-laden air, crystal chamber—vivid and selective. Environment guides movement and mood, but never constrains a choice or exacts a price. The sundial is a micro-object but remains symbolic rather than tactical. Final sky image is lovely yet doesn’t hinge on setting detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“sky is wrong”—is declared early. Escalation is a single smooth ascent: reach chamber, swap pieces, sky fixed. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible cost. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder and playful courage emerges through imagery and action, never sermonized. Final image of “world reborn” offers gentle resonance but no conceptual repricing. Subtext remains light; no competing goods or moral friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and slightly elevated—apt for a mythic tone. Rhythm modulates with ascent and descent. No dialogue; interior monologue stays coherent. Occasional poetic filler (“gazing out into the swirling mists”) slows propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich. A few stock phrases (“gaze out into the void,” “steeped themselves”) and mild overwriting (“the very fabric of reality began to unravel”) dull edge. No loops or grammar slips. High information density overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Chivalrous thief restoring sky via enchanted chess is fresh enough, though fairy-tale scaffolding is familiar. Specificity of “hand-carved chess pieces that governed the celestial balance” lifts it. No radical risk, but synthesis feels organic.</comment>
