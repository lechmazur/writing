<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s curiosity is stated but never complicates her actions; the woman’s grief is sketched in tears and a single whispered line, not embodied contradiction. The “contact tracer for hearts” premise remains abstract—no micro-choice shows how this vocation alters tactics or exacts cost. Closure is gentle but unmotivated by prior flaw or struggle; the hand-squeeze feels like ritual comfort rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the mist clears, the woman leaves lighter, Aria stays behind changed. Causality is situational—Aria follows pulses, speaks comfort, atmosphere responds—but no tightening choice narrows options or exacts visible price. Orientation is clear within 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Cost is implied, not legible on the page, keeping the score below 7.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium is evoked with selective sensory detail—twilight hush, fog swirl, hearing-aid hum—filtered through Aria’s listening stance. Setting guides movement: pulses draw her, mist parts after her words. Yet the environment never constrains a choice or exacts a price; it mirrors mood rather than limiting tactics. Strong texture, but no 9-band constraint keeps it capped at 7.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reassure the grieving woman—is signaled early and met without resistance or escalation. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the woman’s sorrow simply eases under Aria’s words. Coincidence (meeting at the exact spot) is allowed under Situational lens but does not complicate. Closure is peaceful but lacks a visible or felt price that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living presence emerges through the photograph and hearing-aid hum rather than statement. Subtext is present—tears, hand-squeeze, vanishing mist—but remains gentle, not charged with ambiguity or cost. Final image of Aria listening to fading pulses offers quiet resonance yet no conceptual repricing. Avoids overt moralizing, but thematic weight stays modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Aria’s perceptions; diction is consistent, slightly elevated lyric register suits twilight mysticism. Sensory filtering is character-specific—she hears pulses others cannot. No dialogue to test voice distinction; prose rhythm is steady, occasionally lulls into template cadence (“the mist… the woman… the atrium”). Clean, unobtrusive, but not yet distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; occasional soft filler (“mystical realm,” “otherworldly silence”) could be sharper. Metaphors are coherent, no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety is adequate; momentum never stalls. Minor scaffold in repeated mist imagery does not obscure causality. Proofreading clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts” using a dead girl’s hearing aid—is fresh and lightly mythic. Execution stays safe: no risk taken with structure or voice, no unexpected turn that reframes the concept. Emotional specificity is modest; the story could swap names and places without structural change. A quiet, pleasant innovation rather than a bold one.</comment>
