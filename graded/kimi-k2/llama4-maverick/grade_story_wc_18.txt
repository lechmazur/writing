<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (capture the dream), but interiority stays abstract—“felt firmly grounded” is label, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure; the mirror simply completes. Endurance/renunciation is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror becomes a doorway, boundaries erased. Causal chain is soft—breathing sync feels like magic rather than earned mechanics—but the final image reweights premise. Cost is conceptual (self-erasure) yet legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is thick, selective: “morbid perfume,” “twilight frost shimmer.” Fog and orchard remain backdrop rather than active constraint; the mirror itself becomes the micro-setting that charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recreate the dream—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: mirror nears completion, dream materializes. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no visible price is paid until the vanishing, which is off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries emerges through the mirror’s final image rather than statement. Resonant, non-literal payoff. Some drift toward abstraction—“world where impossible became possible”—but ambiguity feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, with perceptual signature: “shards of splintered light.” No dialogue, so no risk of slippage. Patterned diction (“upon the shimmer of twilight frost”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmer of twilight frost like a still pond”) flirt with excess but stay legible. No loops or filter-verb clusters. Strong cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—mirror maker capturing dreams via broken sextant—feels fresh synthesis of mythic and artisanal. Transformation test passes: specific details (sextant fragments, glass mountains) could not be swapped. Risky lyric mode held successfully.</comment>
