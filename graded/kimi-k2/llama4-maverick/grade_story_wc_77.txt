<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Protagonist’s curiosity is stated but never embodied in a concrete micro-choice; the “whispering advisor” is off-stage, so interiority is generic and unconflicted. No visible cost or change—he simply wakes and walks away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Closure is a fade-to-black followed by summary; the decisive change (if any) happens off-page. Causal chain stalls at the mirror beat; the final “funhouse is always waiting” is a tag-line, not a reconfiguration with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Funhouse atmosphere is vivid—decay, glow, cracked mirror—but the setting never constrains a choice or weaponizes its geography. Sensory detail is strong yet ornamental; the mirror could be anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes (“trick fear into revealing its weakness”) are declared but never tested; pressure plateaus after the mirror vision. No escalation or narrowing of options—protagonist is passive observer throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of voyeuristic dread glimmers but stays abstract; the cursed-model motif is introduced late and never reweighted. Final image repeats the poster smile without reconfiguring its meaning or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with a gothic cadence that suits the funhouse. However, heavy reliance on stock phrases (“siren’s call,” “black as coal”) flattens the perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but padded—repetitive “whispering advisor” tags and echoing “lingering luminance” phrases slow momentum. No line-level artifacts in the closing beat, yet density is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines carnival-horror with photographic curse, a fresh pairing, but execution leans on familiar gothic tropes without transformative twist. Risk is moderate; payoff feels pre-fabricated.</comment>
