<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract summary (“anguished joy” repeated). The historian’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) are stated rather than dramatized in micro-choice; the final transformation is asserted, not earned by visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda reweights perception of the lost city. However, the causal chain is thin—avoiding patterns is told, not shown altering tactics—and the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Archive and twilight glow are vividly rendered and filter through the historian’s gaze. The pagoda’s facets mirror her shifting perception, but the setting never physically constrains her choices; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover forbidden knowledge—is clear early. Escalation is textural (density of nostalgia) rather than causal; the tightening is a single visionary beat, not a narrowing of options with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia-as-atom emerges organically from imagery and culminates in the final reconfiguration. Avoids overt moralizing, but the insight remains slightly abstract; the emotional aftereffect is present yet generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature is strong (“saffron-veil,” “luminescent orbs”). Occasional elevated diction edges toward purple, but never breaks POV coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive, but figurative layering becomes dense in visionary climax; minor synonym loops (“atoms of nostalgia” / “secrets they held”) dull final impact. No mechanical errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mystical artifact and quantum nostalgia feels fresh; avoids stock tropes. The “avoid patterns” instruction is underutilized, muting ingenuity. Specificity of bronze pagoda at twilight is memorable.</comment>
