<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts into abstract self-diagnosis ("weight of honesty," "freed by honesty") rather than embodied contradiction. The registrar’s single micro-choice—raising the lens—comes late and feels more symbolic than causally compelled. No visible cost is attached to her final stance, so the change reads as attitudinal rather than path-closing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens reconfigures perception and signals a stance crystallization. However, the causal chain is thin; the doodles’ meaning is asserted rather than dramatized, and the “before/after” shift is more conceptual than experiential. The lens’s payoff is legible, but the cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The crystal forecourt’s wet stone scent and resonant hush create a textured, micro-setting atmosphere. Yet the environment never actively constrains choice or supplies resources; it mirrors mood without altering tactics. The monolith’s reflection is vivid but functions mainly as backdrop for the final image rather than an interactive constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—thawing mistrust via transparency—is declared early but never tested in scene; no interpersonal pressure materializes. Escalation is textural (density of reflection) rather than causal, producing a cadence shift but no narrowing of options. The final stance feels pre-ordained, not forced by rising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of honesty-as-liberation emerges through imagery rather than dramatized conflict. The lens and doodles serve as metaphorical echoes, but the insight remains abstract. Final resonance is atmospheric rather than earned through specific, costly experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to hush and shimmer. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts out of the registrar’s lexicon, but the cadence sustains a hypnotic texture. No dialogue; internal monologue stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished, with rhythmic variation and sensory specificity. A few paraphrase loops (“whispers of the city” twice, “mistrust and secrecy” reframed) slightly dilute momentum. No figurative muddle in the closing beat, but density could be higher; some sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The crystal forecourt and projector lens create a fresh, dreamlike frame, but the emotional arc treads familiar ground: artifact-as-revelation, honesty-as-redemption. The synthesis is elegant yet not startling; risk is stylistic rather than structural. Specificity of doodles is the most original inflection.</comment>
