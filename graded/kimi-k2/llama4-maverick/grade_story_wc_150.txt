<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“shiver run down her spine”), but her motives remain abstract (“restore lost faith”) rather than tested in a concrete beat; the sundial base never forces a choice that reveals contradiction or cost. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Maya surveys the tomb and feels “cautious enchantment”—but the cost is diffuse and off-stage; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight stakes or foreclose a path. Orientation is clear, but causality is loose: excavation proceeds without obstacle or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vividly anchored (“roots snaked between ancient bones”), and the sundial base recurs as a tactile object. However, the setting never actively constrains a choice or charges the final image; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with heritage—is declared early but never tested; excavation unfolds smoothly without reversals or resource loss. Pressure is static; the final feeling of harmony lacks a visible trade-off or narrowing of possibilities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of heritage-as-restoration emerges through imagery rather than statement, but it stays at the level of mood. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration; the sundial and orchard do not accrue new symbolic weight that re-orders meaning.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptions; diction is controlled and sensory. No dialogue appears, so voice consistency is judged on narration alone—clean, but not yet distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and free of loops; figurative language is selective (“sunlight filtered… dappled shadows”). Occasional generic phrasing (“sense of wonder growing within her”) keeps it from the highest band, but clarity and rhythm remain intact through the close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The diaspora-returnee-in-orchard premise is fresh, and the sundial base offers a non-obvious focal object. Yet the plot beats follow a familiar archaeological-reverie arc without a transformative twist; the enchantment feels cautious but not surprising.</comment>
