<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority is present but drifts into diagnostic self-labeling (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive”) rather than embodied contradiction. The betrayal revelation is summarized, not dramatized, so the final stance shift feels asserted rather than earned. Micro-choice at the table (decoding) is clear, yet the cost of stepping “out of the shadows” remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—protagonist exits library with new resolve—but the lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and Causal without firm linkage. The “truth is in the shadows” reweights earlier material, yet the causal chain from seashell to stance change is thin. Orientation is clear early; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rusted library under stars is sketched with selective sensory cues (dim light, dust, starlight) that mirror internal gloom. The seashell’s hum and the child-cast bookmark act as micro-setting objects constraining the decoding beat. Spatial anchors hold; atmosphere supports theme without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—is declared early but tested only through the decoding puzzle, not through physical risk or social exposure. Escalation is a single cognitive tightening; no visible price is paid on the page. Stakes remain largely abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through the decoding act, yet the final articulation (“I was ready to take on the world”) edges toward explicit moral. Subtext is strongest in the seashell’s hum and the shadow motif; resonance would deepen if the cost were dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, slightly lyrical, with controlled psychic distance. Filter verbs appear but stay within POV lexicon. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest, though occasional template cadence (“I was… I was…”) flattens intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, readable, with moments of vivid compression (“rusted library under the stars”). Minor loops (“I felt… I felt…”) and stock phrasing (“shiver run down my spine”) dull peak beats. No overwriting; clarity intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stunt-double-with-phobias is fresh but under-leveraged; no physical stunt or risk appears. Seashell-cast pairing is intriguing yet generic in execution. The synthesis feels like a skillful remix rather than a singular vision; risk-taking is cautious.</comment>
