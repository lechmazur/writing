<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority never rises above lyrical shorthand; bird translation is tell-only, lacks concrete choice; seed-sac cliché repeats. Motivation is told (vision) rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse in scene. Renunciation-to-garden is earnest but undramatized beyond simple act, leaving no felt flaw or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: coachman finishes seeding and drives away, land “reborn.” Closure beat lands on page, cost is conceptual (“garden reclaiming battlefield”) and felt. Lens = Accumulative/Textural—repeating floral motifs gather force. One static scene: no causal tightening, no rising pressure, only pattern intensification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jetty, dying reef, twilight petals are lush but mostly scenic; seed pods and terrain constraints pollinate — seeds must be hand-scattered before dark, grounding stakes. Sensory blend (scent/music) reinforces motif rather than guiding choice. Specificity earns 9-gate; final garden image re-charges seed ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: battlefield-to-garden transformation. No escalation; Declared twice, never tested or opposed—conflict is purely internal resolve that never wobbles. One tightening choice (scatter seeds), cost implied but thin. Stake feels abstract rather than urgent; pressure flattens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Submerged concord and renewal vs. vanquish subtly resonate; no moral speechifying. Moss-covered conflict to life triumphant re-weights theme elegantly through final garden glow. Theme rarely challenges ambiguity—renewal is undeniably positive, some flatness earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close fluctuates between external lyric and loose interiority; perceptual signature distinct (“muted brown”), consistent cadence. No dialogue, no POV slippage. Vocabulary slightly literary but within POV range; some template cadences (“coachman... coachman... coachman”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm pleasant but repetition of “blooming” and “seed” in 2-sentence bursts. Some overwriting: “narrow vastness,” “gloom-hill” appear decorative. Occasional scaffold loops: jetty/blooming/landscape sentence clusters retell rather than tighten. Clarity intact; artifacts mild.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Coachman-seeds-garden is fresh syntactic weave; dead-language skill remains ornamental, no narrative payoff. Rich soundscape of bird-augury to seed ritual is evocative, yet stakes/theme familiar—post-war restoration. Specificity rather than radical angle of attack on tropes. Small +risk for lyrical compression within tight word count.</comment>
