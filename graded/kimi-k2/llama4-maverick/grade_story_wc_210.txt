<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alchemist’s interiority is vivid (“mind consumed,” “fierce intensity”), yet choices remain abstract—“conceive a plan,” “begin to work”—without a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final shift from contemplation to action is declared rather than dramatized, so the cost feels generalized rather than personally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a declared Conceptual Repricing (“after the last wish is granted that true creation begins”), but the causal bridge from memory-reconstruction to physical revival is elided; we leap from vision to flourishing town without on-page mechanics. Orientation is clear early; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Paper-lantern cove is atmospherically rich—scent of decay, shifting amber reflections—yet the lanterns only “seem to grow brighter”; they never physically constrain or enable the alchemist’s next move. Micro-setting (the bottle) is present but static, so environment doesn’t quite charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reviving the town—is signaled early; pressure escalates through memory reconstruction, but the decisive tightening (the first dawn action) is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is inferred rather than felt. Escalation is textural, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebirth-through-imagination emerges organically from the alchemist’s refusal of nostalgia and embrace of reinvention. Final line reweights the premise, but the absence of a dramatized trade-off keeps resonance just shy of piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through the alchemist’s arcane perceptual bias (“patterns that seemed to shift and writhe”). Rhythm modulates with contemplative elongation and dawn-beat acceleration; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is evocative and largely loop-free, but occasional soft scaffolding (“the alchemist’s thoughts turned…”) and stacked abstract nouns (“revival and rebirth, of a community reborn”) slightly dilute propulsion. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing alchemy, memory, and civic resurrection offers a fresh angle on the ghost-town trope. The amber bottle as sealed catalyst is intriguing, though its exact function remains ornamental; risk-taking is present but not fully realized.</comment>
