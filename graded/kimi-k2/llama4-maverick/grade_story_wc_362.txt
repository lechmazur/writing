<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mystic’s desire to prove objects absorb emotion is stated repeatedly but never tested through action; interiority circles rather than intensifies. No micro-choice under pressure crystallizes her values or exacts cost. The ending epiphany feels granted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is clear by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as mist lifts and she “knows” truth, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern deepens but lacks tightening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost on car window are vivid and selective. The glass prism constrains perception and returns in the final glow, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent; weather modulates tone without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving emotional absorption—is declared early but never put to a test that could fail; pressure is atmospheric, not consequential. No meaningful tightening narrows options or exacts price. Escalation is poetic accretion, not risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “truthful lies” emerges through frost patterns and prism refractions rather than exposition. Final image reweights premise: world is “alive with emotions” yet remains enigmatic. Subtextual resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent; perceptual signature is attentive, slightly arcane. Syntax modulates with rising awe; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“commune with the world beyond the veil”) fits mystic POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; rhythm breathes with scene needs. A few near-repetitions (“mystic… mystic’s”) and soft abstractions (“profound truth”) slightly dull edge. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Frost-etched car window as oracle is fresh; prism as emotional lens feels inevitable in hindsight. Combines mundane and mystical without gimmickry. Specificity of quartz arbor grounds the fantastical in tactile place.</comment>
