<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority is present but abstract (“felt a sense of peace,” “sense of wonder”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses in scene; choices are generalized (“she knew she had to…”) without visible micro-cost. Character functions more as observing consciousness than agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, orientation anchored early. Closure is a quiet Earned Stasis—she turns away having accepted her task—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of reflection holds, yet tightening is mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly evoked through mirrored water, mist, and prism light. Sensory detail is selective and filtered by the glazier’s gaze. Setting does not actively constrain choice but supplies charged imagery that supports the reflective mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the world’s hidden beauty before it shifts—is declared early but never tested under rising pressure. No meaningful narrowing of options; the stone’s ripples serve as contemplative trigger, not obstacle. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “illuminating value in the mundane” emerges through imagery rather than statement. Subtext is present but thin; final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis. Resonance is gentle, not transformative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature of a visual artisan (“facets glinting like a thousand tiny diamonds”). Rhythm is calm, reflective, matching the dawn stillness. No dialogue; prose texture is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and largely free of loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“noctilucent reckonings,” “clear complexity”) flirts with abstraction but remains legible. Density is moderate; some sentences could be tightened for sharper propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Concept of a glazier who reads hidden patterns in light and water is fresh. Execution leans contemplative rather than surprising; the prism and ripples feel inevitable rather than revelatory. Specificity of craft is hinted but not fully leveraged.</comment>
