<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s grief-driven vow is clear, but interiority drifts into summary (“thoughts turn,” “felt the weight lifting”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (following ants, stepping through doorway) align with motives yet lack visible cost or flaw-driven error. The final note from her father lands as external validation rather than earned internal shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern chamber and note reframe the promise as ongoing legacy, with conceptual cost (she must now curate, not merely decode). Causal chain holds—chip → ants → map → note—but the creek’s rising threat never physically constrains the final choice, muting the Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The blooming cavern’s scent and dripping water filter through Emilia’s map-trained attention, guiding her pattern recognition. The creek’s rising edge supplies a ticking pressure that, while not fully leveraged, charges the threshold moment. Spatial choreography is clear; the stone-map puzzle constrains her path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fulfill the promise—remains abstract until the final note. Escalation is accumulative: each trial deepens wonder but doesn’t narrow options or raise stakes. Agency is present (she chooses a path), yet the cost is emotional rather than tactical; no resource is visibly lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy vs. solitude emerges through the father’s hidden chamber, avoiding overt statement. The matrix chip’s shift from cryptic object to key quietly reweights the premise. Subtext is strongest in the note’s understated grief and duty; earlier beats lean on evocative but generic imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Emilia’s empirically intuitive lens, with selective sensory detail. Rhythm modulates with scene tension; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“lingering promise,” “empirically intuitive”) feels slightly academic for the intimate POV but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with purposeful cadence shifts. Minor scaffold: “the creek continued to rise” appears twice in close proximity; “glimmered” recurs without pattern payoff. Metaphors (“maze of dusty relics”) are functional, not strained. No loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing type-foundry chip, ants, and living stone map yields a fresh mythic texture. The premise avoids standard quest tropes by centering on quiet inheritance rather than treasure. Specificity of the father’s note and antique trade lends authenticity; risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
