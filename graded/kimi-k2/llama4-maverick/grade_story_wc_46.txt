<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but the star watcher’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no concrete micro-choice under pressure tests the pearl-of-stillness goal. The final “smile” is too gentle to register as earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing strokes layer density until the sea glass glows, reweighting the grotto’s hush. Closure is a Charged Poise—the zephyr bloom suffuses the space—but the cost is only atmospheric, not personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, damp stone, and salt tang are vivid and selective; the grotto’s hush actively muffles the world, shaping the star watcher’s no-fire constraint. Micro-setting (bench, wheel, glass) constrains every gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sharing stillness without fire—is signaled early and tightens through each polishing stroke. Yet pressure is ambient, not acute; no single beat forces a trade-off or visible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of stillness emerges organically from polishing ritual and grotto atmosphere; final image of the zephyr bloom offers resonant, non-moralizing closure. Occasional abstract phrasing (“pearl of stillness”) edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, oceanic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors shimmer, hush, and salt. Syntax modulates with meditative rhythm; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; sensory detail is purposeful, loops are rare. A few soft near-repeats (“soft luminescence,” “gentle light”) slightly dilute momentum but never stall it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar meditation-on-craft frame is refreshed by the no-fire constraint and the zephyr-bloom coinage. Specificity of grotto and sea glass keeps it from feeling generic.</comment>
