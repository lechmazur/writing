<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“cheerful gloom deepening”), but the contradictions are more declarative than dramatized; the final stance of acceptance carries a visible cost through the luminous crater-glass that now “holds weight,” yet memory-fade feels externally decreed rather than an internal flaw compounding choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive is Accumulative/Textural: pattern and texture re-encode a missing path; closure re-weights memory and world as fluid, with the cost legible in the humming stone now “a part of the cave”; one minor orientation wobble early (who recollectionist is never named), but the payoff waives the deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Gleam, pool, crystal, mirror—tactile micro-world sustains POV wonder; geode walls directly generate the disappearing-path puzzle and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Exotic naming without grounding costs it 0.3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—path evaporation—tightens to a single, lyrical crystallization rather than escalating pressure through choices. Agency is recognition rather than alteration; price is felt but not forced, yielding a soft but earned closure under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Flux of memory as flux of paths emerges organically from symbols and final image; however “theme-lift” note in closing lines (“she knew that...”) nudges the score down from higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Controlled lyricism, shifting micro-focalization (“she closed her eyes... crystalline structure”), sentence rhythm mirrors the hush and shimmer; slight over-prettiness in places but no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Almost zero scaffolding; only occasional soft-landing repetitions (“path that had previously disappeared reappeared”). Dense yet clear, with sonic balance and purposeful enjambment. One near-cliché (“gentle lapping of waves”) costs minor 0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Reconceiving lost memory as literal topography in a geode is non-obvious and sustained; seed-trail device risked contrivance but is woven early and recouped at the end. Slight derivativeness of “luminous crystals” keeps it one step shy of breakthrough.</comment>
