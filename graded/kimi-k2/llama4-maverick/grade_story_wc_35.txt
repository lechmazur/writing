<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory-subsume is embodied—but the “sandpaper rough memories” motive is stated more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the final stance feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s touch absorbs the pavilion’s remorse and reconfigures it into “no longer jagged,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—why the pavilion calls now is unexplained—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the ending image reweights earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The damp sandstone, cool sand, and coral glow are selective and purposeful; the tidal pool micro-setting mirrors the oceanic undertow of memory. Environment constrains movement (cold, darkness) and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—absorb and smooth remorse—is signaled early and tightens once when the flood threatens to overwhelm her. Agency is present (she “stood firm”), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; escalation is single-note yet coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-through-bearing-pain emerges organically from Elara’s gift and the pavilion’s stored sorrow. Final image of “no longer jagged” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the remorse is truly gone or merely dulled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory channel; diction is precise (“ozone,” “coral icebound”) and rhythm modulates with pressure. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops; figurative language is restrained. Occasional elevated phrasing (“repository of stored remorse”) edges toward abstraction but never muddies causality or the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef + coral remorse-pavilion is a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully and follows implications without gimmickry. Specificity of sandstone dampness and tidal-pool analysis anchors the fantastical premise in tactile reality.</comment>
