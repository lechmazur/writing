<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luna’s interiority is vivid—her embodied reaction to the static shock and the geode’s “tingling” anchor her motives—but the shift from skepticism to hope is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The final smile feels earned, yet the absence of a visible renunciation or trade-off keeps the cost abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn painting crystallizes her new stance with a felt cost (solitude traded for creative breakthrough). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens the pattern—though the recall’s causal weight fades after the midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The studio’s linseed-oil scent and the geode’s glitter are woven through action, constraining her movement and charging the final light-painting. Spatial choreography is clean; the “otherworldly glow” risks a touch of cliché but is saved by its integration into the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways via art—is signaled early and escalates through each swirl of light. A single tightening occurs when the static shock recalibrates perception, narrowing her options to the geode-led method; the cost is the telepathy pill loss, but it remains backgrounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: the tension between external chemical shortcuts and internal embodied knowledge. The final image of the fractal painting offers a non-literal answer—art as its own telepathy—without moralizing. One line (“willowglass hope”) flirts with label-speak but is absorbed by context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Luna’s perceptual bias (“colors and textures” jostling). Syntax modulates with intensity—long breaths during meditation, clipped fragments after the shock. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction feels native to her artist-scientist lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. Minor loop risk in “light painting…light sources…light of dawn,” but rhythm variation prevents monotony. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; “willowglass hope” is the lone purple patch, quickly grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of muscovite geode, somatic markers, and recalled telepathy pills feels fresh—an internalized sci-fi alchemy rather than trope salad. Risk lies in the lyric mode, but it heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The premise would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
