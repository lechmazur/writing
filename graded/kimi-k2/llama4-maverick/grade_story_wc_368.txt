<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaito’s curiosity is clear, but interiority drifts into abstract “insatiable curiosity” and “sense of wonder” rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure tests his flaw; the final smile feels unearned because the wing never forces a costly decision. The donor heart is backstory, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light-play thickens toward a resonant image. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a deepening understanding”—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized; nothing is foreclosed. Orientation is clear, yet the ending drifts into summary rather than final, visible beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Floating tea house and valley mist are vivid, selective, and tethered to Kaito’s perception. Lantern glow and refracted wing-light charge the final image. However, the setting never materially constrains choice; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the secret of allure”—is declared early but never tested; no tightening or trade-off occurs. Escalation is purely contemplative; the wing’s beauty intensifies, yet Kaito’s options do not narrow. Cost is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of narrative magnetism emerges through the wing’s refraction metaphor, avoiding overt statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs, but the insight remains abstract—“some people refract light”—without concrete consequence. Subtext is present yet thin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature favors shimmer, mist, and tea aroma. Repetition of “iridescent,” “wonder,” and “mist” flirts with cadence template but stays within tolerable bounds. No dialogue to test distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but cycles “soft,” “ethereal,” “shimmering” in adjacent lines, creating mild synonym loops. Metaphors (“sea of wonder”) verge on purple yet stay legible. No line-level artifact obscures closure, yet density could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating tea house and light-tracking as metaphor for charisma is fresh, avoiding stock fantasy. Wing-as-lens concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no structural gamble, but synthesis of natural science and mysticism is distinctive.</comment>
