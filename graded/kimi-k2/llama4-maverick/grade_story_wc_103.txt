<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian’s curiosity and trepidation are stated but not embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final “ready to integrate” moment lacks a visible cost or renunciation, so the change feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“weave its secrets into their next hedge maze design”) but the cost is only gestured at. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening beat is diffuse—no single image crystallizes the reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Living bridge garden is vividly sketched and the halo fragment’s glow re-uses the dappled light motif, charging the final image. However, the setting never physically constrains Elian’s choices; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—is declared early. A single deepening occurs when Elian realizes active participation, but the escalation is narrated rather than dramatized; the cost of this knowledge is not made visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s texture emerges through imagery rather than statement. The lotus-flower simile and re-weaving metaphor offer quiet resonance, yet the final design promise feels slightly pat, blunting the conceptual bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical cadence matching the reverie tone. Selective sensory filtering (“sweet scent,” “dappled shadows”) keeps POV modest. No head-hop or register drift; slight risk of over-ornamentation but never obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but occasional stacked modifiers (“quaking reverie, a dreamscape where…”) create mild density drag. No loops or filter-verb clusters; rhythm breathes with scene shifts. Metaphors stay coherent, though “texture of time” edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing hedge-maze artistry with hyperbolic time-geometry is fresh; the halo fragment as crystallized chronology is memorable. Risk-taking lies in the lyric accumulative structure, which mostly pays off. Slight familiarity in the garden-mystic frame tempers the score.</comment>
