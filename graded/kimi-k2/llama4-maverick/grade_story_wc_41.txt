<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction; the chalk and driftwood act as tactile anchors, yet the prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness is asserted more than dramatized. A single embodied beat—fingers remembering chalk—shows promise, but most emotion is narrated rather than embodied. The final renunciation of the chalk stub carries felt cost, satisfying the earned-stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the prophet accepts that the “sound of growing older” is to be felt, not found, discarding the chalk with visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density build until the fog reclaims the driftwood path. Orientation is fog-soft but legible by 120 words; no causality breaks. The ending beat lands cleanly on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fog, gravel crunch, and chalk dust are selective and POV-filtered; the garden’s statues and mist act as both mirror and constraint, guiding the prophet’s driftwood choreography. Micro-setting (the chalk stub, the worn statue) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy tightens under pressure, culminating in the charged image of erased markers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the intangible sound—is signaled early and deepens through pattern-building rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the moment the prophet realizes the sound is ambient, foreclosing further search. Cost is conceptual (accepting impermanence) and visible (abandoning the chalk). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and acceptance emerges through concrete particulars—chalk, driftwood, fog—without moralizing. The final image of erased markers offers a non-literal answer to the quest. Subtext resides in silence and gesture; no thematic echo in dialogue. Complexity is honored; the prophet’s peace is earned, not preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tidal, and consistent; patterned repetition (“the fog swirled… the fog closed in”) teaches its rhythm early and pays off in closure. Syntax mirrors the prophet’s precognitive drift—long, languid sentences that contract at the final beat. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV limits. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“mist like a palpable entity”) serve atmosphere without crowding. Information density is high—each sentence advances mood or action. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction is voice-motivated and consistent. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—seeking the sound of aging in a fog sculpture garden—is fresh, synthesizing memory, sound art, and ritual. Driftwood-as-map and chalk-as-talisman transform familiar objects into narrative engines. Risk-taking (lyric, low-plot) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
