<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tranquilly perceptive,” “dappled resolve”), but the story leans on summary rather than micro-choice under pressure; the stamp annotation is the single decisive act, and its cost is more symbolic than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamped mark crystallizes her altered stance and links past to future. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of deepening insight—held cleanly to the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Library’s “reclaimed stillness” is filtered through Elara’s senses and constrains her to silence and slow motion; the stamp as micro-setting object charges the final beat. Selective sensory detail supports mood without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—tightens once when the alternative hypothesis redefines the code. Pressure is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the irrevocable stamp mark, felt but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation and authorship emerges through Elara’s act of annotation; no overt moralizing. The final image reweights the library from forgotten to reclaimed without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-anchored; perceptual signature (“dusty tomes,” “faint scent of aged paper”) feels specific to Elara. No dialogue; free-indirect rhythm supports quiet intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but occasional elevated diction (“gravitas,” “indelible”) edges toward purple. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance knowledge or mood. Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle: a submerged librarian indexing truth with a stamp. Premise avoids cliché, though “forgotten knowledge” is familiar; specificity of stamp and blackout lifts it above template.</comment>
