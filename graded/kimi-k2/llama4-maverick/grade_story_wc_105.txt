<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s synesthetic hearing and grief-driven quest are vivid, embodied, and consistent; the final imprinting beat crystallizes her renunciation of silence as healing. Yet the interior contradiction between seeking “trust breaking” and offering “healing” is asserted more than dramatized in scene, keeping her just shy of full contradictory pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (colors-as-sound, forge whispers, aurora shifts) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—device hums alive, cost is the crystalline shatter felt in her chest—though the causal jump from “absences collected” to “sound captured” is lightly elliptical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sunken greenhouse, forge, and shipwrecks are rendered with selective, synesthetic detail that filters through Lyra’s perception; the forge’s whisper returns in the final beat to charge the closure. Spatial anchors are clear early; only the shipwrecks remain ornamental, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens once when the crystalline note forms; the cost is the visceral shatter in her chest. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but escalation is more texture-deepening than option-narrowing, keeping it just below the 8.2 gate for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-wound and memory-as-craft emerges through concrete particulars (mother’s golden voice fading, absences woven into circuitry). Final image of “battered marvel” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing; slight drift toward therapeutic abstraction in “catalyst for growth” caps the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“soft blue murmur,” “rusty red groan”) is distinct and sustained. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal glow,” “otherworldly light”) edges toward purple but stays within character filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Minor loop risk in “as the night wore on” / “as the first light of dawn” but momentum survives. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure; one filter-verb cluster (“seemed to whisper”) is voice-motivated and forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—synesthetic sound-engineer of emotional absence in a drowned greenhouse—is fresh, specific, and fully committed. Transformation test: swap any element and the story collapses. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final crystalline note; only the shipwreck ring feels underused, preventing 9.0.</comment>
