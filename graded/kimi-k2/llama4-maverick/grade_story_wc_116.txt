<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s motivation—witness without judgment—is stated repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice; interiority drifts into abstract mantra rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure crystallizes values or exacts cost, so the arc remains static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric reprise (Earned Stasis) that reweights the premise: the keeper “remained” in regenerative silence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but causality is loose—burrowing is more mood than decisive act—so cost feels diffuse rather than sharply paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Library catacombs and obsidian refuge are evoked with tactile decay—“damp earth,” “flickering candles”—and the refuge’s silence finally envelops the keeper, charging the ending image. Spatial anchors arrive early; however, the river’s geography remains vague, limiting constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the lure of regenerative silence versus the duty to witness; pressure accrues texturally but never tightens into a trade-off. Burrowing deepens mood rather than foreclosing an option, so escalation feels atmospheric, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as balm emerges through repeated imagery rather than assertion, culminating in the keeper’s stasis. Subtext is present but thin; the refrain “without judgment” edges toward label-speak, muting complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, hushed, and parchment-dusty; diction favors antiquated cadence without slipping into pastiche. Perceptual signature is strong—notice of “aged parchment” and “crystal veins”—but syntactic repetition (“the chronicle keeper…”) flattens rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical and mostly clean, yet loops (“the chronicle keeper…”) and near-paraphrase clusters dull momentum. Metaphors are coherent; no closure-beat artifacts, but density is diluted by echoing phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Concept of regenerative silence in a buried library is fresh, yet execution leans on familiar tropes of timeless archivists and mystical stillness. Specificity of origami swan is intriguing but under-leveraged, keeping ingenuity moderate.</comment>
