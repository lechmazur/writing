<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is present but leans toward summary (“felt an inexplicable pull,” “sense of purpose he hadn’t felt in years”) rather than embodied contradiction. The stubborn trait is stated but never complicates an on-page choice; the final rest is granted rather than earned through visible struggle. Motivation remains abstract—“give rest a permanent address”—without friction or cost shown in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker stays, the signal becomes an invitation, and the cost is the life he gives to guardianship. Causality is causal-lite; the package triggers action, but the underwater sequence is delivered as montage rather than scene, blurring because/therefore links. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The underwater library is sketched with selective sensory cues—“musty scent of old books,” “soft glow of luminescent creatures”—that support the stillness theme. Spatial choreography is loose but coherent; the lens functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Atmosphere is consistent, though environment never actively resists or aids the protagonist beyond ambience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the signal to offer rest—is declared early. Pressure rises only narratively: “treacherous currents” are mentioned, not enacted; no on-page obstacle tests resolve. The final shift from distress call to invitation is asserted rather than dramatized, so cost feels conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stillness-as-sanctuary emerges through imagery rather than statement. The library’s transformation from tomb to beacon carries resonance, but the undertaker’s interior arc is too smooth to deepen the theme’s complexity. Subtext is present in the signal’s tonal shift, yet the story edges toward moral summary in the closing paragraph.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is mild but consistent (“eerie stillness that swallowed all sound”). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable pull,” “otherworldly energy”) slightly overshoots the undertaker’s presumed register but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; sentences vary in rhythm. A few stock phrases (“worn down by the relentless demands,” “heart finally at peace”) dull specificity. No figurative muddle or scaffolding in the closure beat. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of undertaker, lighthouse lens, and underwater library is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes (forgotten city, beacon of hope) are transformed through the protagonist’s vocation and the signal’s re-purposing. Specificity in the undertaker’s trade is light, but the premise’s synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
