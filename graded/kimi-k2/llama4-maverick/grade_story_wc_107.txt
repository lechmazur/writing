<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is textured—hands stained, voice weaving spell—but the “thawing heart” remains abstract therapy-speak; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The final smile feels unearned because the cost of abandoning the familiar is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb glows, reconfiguring Elian’s stance from isolation to vocation. Yet the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is only implicit; the causality between “abandon” and the orb’s glow is asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned control room is vivid—sunlight on dust, dripping water—and the orb refracts that light onto consoles, charging the final image. Spatial anchors arrive early; the room’s decay subtly mirrors Elian’s thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting safe zones—remains thematic; no concrete obstacle or trade-off appears on the page. The “abandon” beat is narrated rather than enacted, so pressure never tightens; cost is gestural.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through art emerges from the orb’s light, but the thawing-heart metaphor is repeated rather than deepened. Final paragraph edges toward moralizing (“they knew they would never be alone”), blunting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elian’s perceptual bias—molten warmth, kaleidoscope colors. No dialogue, so no risk of register drift; the dramatic narration of mundane tasks is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and sensory specificity. Occasional filler—“weighty lightness,” “morbid perfume”—leans purple but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Glassblower in a derelict control room is fresh, and the orb-as-beacon avoids cliché. Yet the thawing-heart conceit is familiar; risk is moderate, not bold. Specificity of craft elevates the premise.</comment>
