<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her synesthetic substitution of emotional “mapping” for lost scent is specific—but the piece never forces her to test that skill under pressure; the clamp screw is fondled, not wielded. No contradictory impulse is enacted in scene; the “trembling calm” is asserted, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything. The result is a static meditation rather than a character-driven arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is present as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she leaves the shop resolved to keep “reading between the lines,” now re-weighted by the screw’s imagined histories. Causality is accumulative/textural: the fog, clocks, and screw layer into a final charged poise. However, the story never risks a decisive change or forfeiture; the cost is purely conceptual, blunting high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The water-clock shop is economically anchored—reservoir lapping, mist, soft ticking—and the midwife screw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection skews visual, but the muted soundscape mirrors Elara’s olfactory absence. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. The environment does not constrain a visible choice, capping Q3 just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Stake—revealing “ordinary miracles” through occluded perception—is declared early but never narrowed; no external or internal obstacle escalates. The screw offers potential pressure (memory, pain, risk) yet remains a contemplative prop. One meaningful tightening is required; instead we get iterative restatement of the same insight. Consequently the conflict plateaus rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: substitution of empathy for lost sense, the sacred in mundane tools. Subtext resides in the screw’s untold births, but the story spells out its own thesis (“she sought to humanize…”) twice, dampening resonance. Final image of fog as “soothing balm” reweights earlier mist without moralizing, earning mid-7 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is calm, slightly lyrical, matching “trembling calm.” No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” territory) slips in—“she envisioned the countless births it had facilitated”—but generally the prose breathes with her mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; rhythm supports meditative tempo. No scaffold loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained, though “trembling calm” is repeated without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate—some sentences do only one job—keeping the piece from the highest band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The aromatherapist-who-lost-smell angle is fresh, and linking it to a birthing screw is inventive, yet the narrative stays in safe lyric-reflection territory without risking a dramatic turn. Conceptual payoff feels inevitable but not surprising; the screw’s history is imagined, not revealed through action. Sufficient specificity prevents generic score, but lacks bold risk.</comment>
