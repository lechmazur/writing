<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Widow’s interiority is vivid and embodied (grief pressing on chest), but her choices remain static—carving, sipping tea—without a micro-choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The final “sad smile” gestures toward earned stasis yet lacks visible cost; the carving completes without changing her next move. Reflection stays within BRR limits but doesn’t tilt present stance. Character reads as a sensibility rather than an agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the finished carving crystallizes grief into “rust-hued peace.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory detail and cadence shift reweight the stake. However, the cost is more asserted (“something manageable”) than dramatized; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks, yet escalation is mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft is tactile and selective—diffused light, kettle steam, ash grain—filtered through widow’s narrowed perception. Micro-setting (tea, wood, rain) constrains her ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Environment does not evolve causally with events, limiting higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing grief—is signaled early and held. Pressure deepens via accumulative texture (rain, scrape, aroma) rather than a tightening choice; no live option is foreclosed. Agency is contemplative endurance; cost is emotional but not visibly paid on the page. Sufficient for length, yet lacks the decisive intensification required for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience (“here and gone”) emerges organically from ritual and wood shavings; no direct statement. Final image reweights the concept by making absence tangible in the carving. Subtext resides in silence, steam, and grain. Complexity is present but leans toward acceptance rather than tension; ambiguity is modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature attuned to texture and temperature. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Diction stays within widow’s plausible lexicon; sensory verbs are precise. No dialogue to test naturalism. Compression and elision are purposeful; no clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance atmosphere or interiority. Occasional soft phrases (“gentle whisper,” “soft scrape”) verge on template but do not cluster. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is spare and coherent. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction in “rust-hued peace,” but it fits the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Widow wood-carver ritual is familiar, yet the fusion of circus widowhood with meditative craft offers a fresh inflection. Specificity of ash grain and kettle steam grounds the premise. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is modest; premise is not radically transformed, but emotional specificity elevates it above template.</comment>
