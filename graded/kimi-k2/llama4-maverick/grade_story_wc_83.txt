<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Amira’s interiority is vivid in the opening beats (“cool, smooth surface” grounding her shock), but once aboard the Observatory her agency thins—she observes data rather than wrestles with it. The geode crystal acts as a talisman more than a crucible; her “determination” is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No visible cost is paid by her at closure; the story ends on promise rather than renunciation or loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pair chart a course into the unknown, reweighting the stakes from personal grief to global potential. However, the drive lens drifts from situational trauma to conceptual quest without a decisive on-page pivot; the “shocking revelation” is delivered by summary, not dramatized choice. Causality holds but feels outline-like in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drone-strike wasteland and the humming Observatory are sharply opposed, each filtering through Amira’s stunned senses. The geode crystal functions as micro-setting, its facets “reflecting the dying light” and later “vibrating,” constraining her focus and guiding the hunt. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—locate the wasted potential that destroyed her wedding—is signaled early and tightens when the data pattern emerges. Yet the pressure escalates through exposition (“Together, they pored over the data”) rather than a visible beat where Amira risks or forfeits something. Cost is conceptual, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Theme of awakening from numb complicity to purposeful hunt emerges organically through image (crystal, Observatory) rather than statement. The bleak exhilaration tone carries thematic weight, but the final paragraph edges toward abstract assertion (“a brighter tomorrow”) rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Amira’s sensory intake; diction is consistent and purposeful. No dialogue, so voice is carried by interior texture and selective detail. Rhythm modulates well from staccato wreckage sentences to longer Observatory reflections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Prose is lean and vivid (“scent of smoke and blood hanging heavy”), with only minor scaffold (“Together, they pored over the data” repeats the prior sentence’s gist). No mixed metaphors or register drift; momentum holds through the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike grief with perturbation-theory data hunt feels fresh; the geode crystal as both talisman and analytical lens is a non-obvious pivot. Risk is present but tempered—the speculative frame could push further into lived consequence.</comment>
