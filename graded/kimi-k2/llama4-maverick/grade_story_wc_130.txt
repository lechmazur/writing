<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the conjurer’s tactile play with the glass eyes and her slow ritual kneel show motive in motion. Yet the “mathematics of emotion” remains an abstract label rather than a dramatized contradiction, and the final insight feels lightly earned—no visible cost or irrevocable choice seals the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the moonlit hush yields a resonant reconfiguration—the orchard’s silence becomes possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “a buried optimism stirring” reweights the stake with felt cost (the unrecoverable loss accepted). Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is rendered through filtered perception—luminescent fungi, dripping stalactites, mosaic stone—each detail constrains the ritual’s choreography. The glass eyes and chipped patterns function as micro-setting objects that guide the conjurer’s hand and charge the final image. Economy is strong; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to quantify the unquantifiable”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns. One meaningful deepening: the shift from ambiguous loss to “buried optimism” reweights the stake with conceptual cost. Agency is contemplative, not active, yet the stance crystallization is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the unknowability of emotion’s calculus is embodied in the orchard’s living silence and the conjurer’s ritual. Subtext resides in the glass eyes’ watchfulness and the mosaic’s fractured harmony. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature is distinct—“gentle rustle,” “delicate pen and ink drawing.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during ritual, softening at closure. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “topography”) stays within conjurer’s plausible lexicon. Final cadence is earned and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermist’s eyes as scrying lenses, orchard as subterranean laboratory of emotion. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity. The conceptual risk—mathematics of grief—pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
