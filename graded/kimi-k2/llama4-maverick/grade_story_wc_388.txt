<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s skepticism and drive are stated but never embodied in a moment of contradiction; she follows clues without visible internal cost. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final awe feels unearned because no flaw or limit complicates her pursuit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Aria stands before the pulsing stillpoint, options reconfigured, cost implied by the eerie glow. Causal chain is thin—shredded letters lead directly to diamond—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s radioactive dust and twisted trees create a tactile filter that narrows Aria’s perception; the pulsating glow at the end reweights the setting from wasteland to liminal threshold. Selective sensory detail supports mood without stalling momentum.</comment>

<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus legend—is signaled early and tightens once when letters reveal orchestrated liquidation. The cost is conceptual (comfortable lies shattered) but not yet viscerally paid; escalation is single-step rather than deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth excavated from layered deceit emerges through the letters’ revelations rather than authorial statement. Final image reframes the orchard from dead zone to threshold, offering resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Aria’s sharply observant filter; diction is consistent and purposeful. No dialogue, so voice is carried by interiority and sensory selection. Rhythm remains steady, neither monotonous nor showy.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, concise, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stock phrases (“shiver run down her spine”) are minor. Sensory specificity outweighs cliché; sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard as reality-thin zone is a fresh synthesis; the cursed diamond as map to a stillpoint feels non-obvious. Tropes are transformed through Aria’s skeptical lens, though the liquidation backstory edges toward familiar dystopia.</comment>
