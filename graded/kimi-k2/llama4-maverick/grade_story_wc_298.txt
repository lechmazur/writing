<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“morbid perfume that clung to her skin”), but the arc leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“constraints she had placed upon herself”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final “peace” feels slightly unearned because the cost of binding her darkness is asserted rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the orchard itself seems transformed. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing corridors reconfigure the space and her stance—yet the causal link between weaving the spell and the orchard’s approval is more atmospheric than mechanical, blunting the cost edge needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile and specific (“tree roots snaked between ancient bones”), and the burned tarot card functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. The environment’s shift from decay to blooming scent charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate, though the spatial choreography of the corridors remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to patch holes in her soul”—is signaled early and tightens through the spell-weaving. One clear deepening occurs when the trees “lean in,” narrowing her options to finish or fail. The cost is atmospheric rather than tangible, keeping it just below the 8.2 threshold for visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-bartering emerges organically from the orchard’s exchange economy of bones and fate. The burned Eight of Swords reweights from symbol of entrapment to talisman of transformation without overt statement. Final image of “gentle, fierce energy” offers resonant ambiguity, though a touch of explanatory gloss (“reminder of the journey”) nudges it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“fiercely gentle touch”) that mirrors the protagonist’s dual impulses. Sensory filter is character-bound and consistent; no POV leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable connection”) edges toward register drift but remains within lyrical tolerances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor loop: “the darkness within her” appears twice in close proximity. One mixed metaphor—“threads of her own making” to “inlay meaning everywhere”—slightly muddies the spell’s mechanics, preventing 8.2+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of necropolis and orchard creates a memorable frame; tarot-as-wound rather than prophecy is a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking stays coherent under the Accumulative lens. The premise flirts with familiar “bargain with fate” tropes but grounds them in bone-soil specificity, earning moderate originality points.</comment>
