<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s longing for a lost world and her drive to weave hope are stated repeatedly, but interiority stays abstract (“hauntingly optimistic vision,” “orchid solace”). No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The final smile is unearned because the tapestry’s cost or limitation is never dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise (glowing tapestry, canyon bathed in light), but the cost is asserted rather than shown. Orientation is clear early, yet causality is weak: the fabric glows “of its own accord,” so the turn lacks agency. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern intensifies but never tightens options or reveals a price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The red canyon labyrinth is vividly sketched—“damp earth,” “fading light”—and the tide-pool clock gives temporal texture. Setting, however, remains backdrop; it never constrains Aria’s movements or tools. The tapestry itself becomes a micro-setting that glows, but its transformation is magical rather than tactile, limiting its charge on the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—transform ruin into reverence—is declared early but never tested; no reversals or trade-offs appear. Pressure is static; the weaving proceeds without obstacle or escalation. The ending asserts success without showing a foreclosed path or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of art redeeming ruin emerges through image rather than statement, but the payoff is generic: “power of art to heal.” Subtext is thin; the storybook plate hints at lost beauty but doesn’t reweight meaning at the end. The final image is pretty yet conceptually unsurprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled cadence and sensory diction (“needle dancing,” “balm to her soul”). Compression and repetition feel intentional, supporting an Accumulative/Textural lens. No POV drift or register mismatch; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and evocative, but occasional loops (“broken precedents,” “path from ruin to reverence”) and stacked modifiers (“hauntingly optimistic vision”) dilute density. No clarity breaks, yet figurative language sometimes overglows without adding new information. Final paragraph repeats earlier phrasing almost verbatim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The weaver-in-labyrinth premise is atmospheric but not conceptually fresh; echoes of “artist redeems wasteland” abound. Specificity of “wharf weaver” is underused—no maritime texture appears. The glowing tapestry twist is visually striking yet feels like familiar magical uplift rather than earned transformation.</comment>
