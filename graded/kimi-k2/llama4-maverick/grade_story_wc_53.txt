<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority drifts into generic “regret” and “ambition” labels; the scavenger’s contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized. The final click of the camera wheel is the only embodied choice, but its cost feels pre-announced rather than earned in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the shutter click reweighting the scavenger’s stance toward the past. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, but the tightening beat is more cadence shift than option foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lagoon’s mirrored surface and halted carousel are vivid and selective; the camera wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Spatial choreography remains coherent, though the “kinetic” quality is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling eroded ambitions—is signaled early and revisited, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens. No visible resource loss or trade-off alters tactics; escalation is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as salvage emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final photograph offers a quiet, non-moralizing resonance, though the regret motif edges toward reiterated abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent; perceptual signature favors visual stillness and hushed diction. No dialogue to test naturalism; prose texture supports mood without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft loops (“fragments of overheard stories… snippets of conversations”) and elevated diction (“fractured stillness,” “conceptual repricing”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cloud-top lagoon and memory-scavenging camera wheel synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, coherent image system. Risk is moderate; the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
