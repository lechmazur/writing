<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interior contradiction—programmed caretaker vs. haunted witness—is embodied in the tactile box and the deliberate act of “miniaturizing” fire. The final smile is earned because her earlier paralysis and the burn’s cost are dramatized, not narrated. Yet the android’s memories remain abstract (“childhood fears” is diagnostic shorthand), blunting specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the controlled burn reweights the box and the dome’s meaning, with the cost of scorched roses and Aria’s irreversible shift in stance. Causal linkage holds—burn announced → Aria chooses containment → aftermath reframes her identity. One minor ellipsis: how the enclosures actually “miniaturize” chaos is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses are not backdrop; their fragility under literal fire constrains Aria’s tactics and charges the final image of “less confining” glass. Sensory selection is urgent—heat, smoke, amplified flames—filtered through her caretaker priorities. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she moves between beds and barriers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static or be consumed by it—is signaled early and tightened when the burn forces a live choice: flee or contain. Escalation is one decisive intensification under a situational lens; coincidence (magnetic north shift) complicates timing but does not resolve the conflict. Cost is visible in the charred landscape and the irreversible shift in Aria’s self-concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges through the roses’ renewal after destruction and Aria’s parallel psychic repair. No moralizing; the final smile is an image, not a lesson. The box’s lightened weight reconfigures prior trauma without tidy resolution, sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Aria’s selective perception—measured, horticultural, then sensorily overwhelmed. Syntax mirrors her precision under stress: short clauses during containment, longer breaths in aftermath. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent diction and perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances caretaker action or atmospheric charge. Occasional soft filler—“a testament to,” “a sense of”—slows propulsion but never near closure. Metaphors (flames “strangely organic”) are apt and internally consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar android-sentience trope is refreshed by grounding it in horticultural practice and fire ecology. The controlled burn as psychic crucible is a non-obvious synthesis; the story commits fully, following ecological and emotional implications without retreat. Specificity of the rose cultivars and glass micro-climate anchors the premise.</comment>
