<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—recover the watch fob to learn family secrets—drives the opening beats, but the pivot to “capture the sound of trust breaking” is asserted rather than dramatized; her interiority is vivid yet generic (“heart quickened,” “mix of excitement and unease”). The final stance crystallizes in a Charged Poise, but the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; causal chain is present (find fob → confront Shadow → fragile truce). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the truce reweights the market’s social fabric. However, the “sound of trust breaking” remains off-page, muting the Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Market beneath rotting pier is evoked with salt, rust, clinking wares; light slats and sunrise anchor time. The watch fob’s engravings glint, constraining Lena’s choice to pocket it under watchful eyes. Setting guides spatial choreography cleanly; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwart The Shadow—signaled early. Tension escalates through proximity and recognition, narrowing to sunrise standoff. Cost is atmospheric (fragile peace) rather than concrete loss, so escalation feels mild under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust’s fragility emerges through the truce-of-hush motif and the fob’s inherited weight. Subtext works in glances and withheld identities. Final image reframes the market’s murmurs, but the insight edges toward summary (“power of determination”).</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lena’s perceptions; sensory filter is consistent. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic lift at tension peaks. Dialogue is sparse but functional; vendor’s gravelly voice distinct for its single line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stock phrases (“heart quickened,” “thick with the smell”) slightly dull edge. Clarity and concision hold; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Pirate-market noir with moonshine lineage offers fresh angle; Shadow antagonist is archetype lightly sketched. Watch fob as heirloom-cipher is specific. Risk is moderate; premise could swap genres with minor tweaks, but texture feels lived-in.</comment>
