<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is consistent—"moved with deliberate slowness" and "deliberate slowness"—yet largely decorative; no contradictory impulse acts on the page, just steady, untested conviction. The final beat ("sat back, her eyes shining") asserts rather than dramatizes the cost of reawakening; the librarian remains unaltered, no path foreclosed. Backstory/Reflection policy honored—only brief fragments (scarf memory) that tilt no present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—she achieves the goal and rests—but the price is asserted not enacted: "for a little while" signals duration without dramatized limitation. Causal chain hangs entirely on belief ("believed that stories...dwelt beyond the physical") rather than demonstrated evidence or compounding choice narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is sensory ("soft glow of reading lamps," "scent of old paper") and atmospherically cohesive, but its influence on choice remains diffuse—no locked doors, no deadline, only ambiance. Early orientation clean by line-5; the library never materially constrains the librarian’s tactical options, so it charges the image but doesn’t steer it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“finding the place where stories live”—stated early but escalate through description alone; no reversal, resource loss, or narrowing choice under pressure. The scarf’s "shimmer" moment reads as intensified mood rather than tightened limitation. Closure is renunciatory stasis, not a cost-drenched choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of stories-as-living-entities emerges organically through sustained metaphor yet is never questioned or re-priced by events—its final confirmation feels circular. Final image of the library as “world a richer...place” summarizes rather than reweights the stakes. Subtext remains poetic assertion; no lingering ambiguity complicates the vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric compression and hushed sensory catalog; the third-person POV never wavers. Syntax, however, flirts with template cadence in places (“As she worked... As the hours passed...”), dulling texture. No head-hop or lexical drag; compression remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm lilts with cadenced parallelism that occasionally slackens propulsion. Information density good—“she mapped the hyperbolic spaces”—but relies on repeated soft phrase stems (“soft glow,” “soft touch”) that verge on loop. Figurative coherence held; no closure-image obscured by figurative clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing non-Euclidean geometry and analog-memory metaphor is intellectually fresh, yet the narrative risk is atmospheric rather than structural—the geometry remains abstract, its constraint not materialized through action. Specificity of setting and tone feel individual, not derivative.</comment>
