<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “weight of expectation” and “lullaby of conformity” are told, not embodied. The bodily poetic form is asserted, not dramatized through action. Micro-choices are implied rather than shown; the untangling is metaphorical, not tactile. Final renunciation feels earned but cost is diffuse rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s glow marks a decisive shift from conformity to self-chosen purpose. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; each thread-untangling beat intensifies the prism’s charge. Orientation is swift; setting and POV are anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual—loss of old identity—rather than tangible, but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow, and prism are vividly selective; prism’s facets reflect starlight to mirror internal change. Environment constrains mood and supplies the transformative object. Sensory detail is filtered through the courtesan’s heightened perception. Final image of prism sanctuary as “beacon of hope” recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy conformity—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untangled thread deepens the prism’s glow, tightening the choice to step away. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and societal abstraction. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is loss of past identity, felt but diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-definition versus societal role emerges through image and action, not statement. Subtext resides in the prism’s silent witness and the snow’s indifferent beauty. Final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-locked. Syntax and diction suit a courtesan’s heightened aesthetic perception. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is elegant but occasionally drifts into poetic redundancy (“gentle reminder of the world’s beauty” after snow already established). No loops or scaffolds. Metaphors are coherent. Density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Minor overwriting in final paragraph keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms familiar “courtesan seeks freedom” trope through prism sanctuary and harvest of echoes. Specificity of bodily poetic form and silver courtyard grounds the arc. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate; lyric mode is well-executed but not radical.</comment>
