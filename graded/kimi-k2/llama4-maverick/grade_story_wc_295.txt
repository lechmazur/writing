<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is abstract (“sense of purpose,” “heart swelled”) rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses are dramatized. The only micro-choice—returning to the inscriptions—lacks visible cost or friction. Motivation is stated, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure is a soft epiphany (“world seemed a little brighter”) without decisive change or felt cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the cadence shift is too gentle to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear, yet causality between telegram, stars, and breakthrough remains asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Observatory dome, starlight, scent of old books create textured atmosphere; the daylily-pressed telegram is a tactile micro-setting object. However, the environment never constrains Lyra’s choices or charges the final image—setting remains backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode temple inscriptions”—is declared early but never visibly tested; no tightening or trade-off appears. Pressure is static; the breakthrough is narrated rather than earned through agency. Cost is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared burdens is stated repeatedly yet emerges through exposition, not dramatized conflict. The telegram and stars gesture toward resonance but do not reweight meaning at closure. Subtext remains thin; final paragraph drifts toward moral summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and reflective; perceptual signature is present (“stars twinkle in rhythm with her thoughts”). However, diction occasionally slips into generic uplift (“world is bathed in a new light”), flattening specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with rhythmic variation and few loops. Occasional stock phrasing (“gentle glow,” “deep sense of connection”) and mild overwriting in final third dull precision. No artifacts obscure causality, yet density could be higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Lucid-dream chronicler using variable stars as maps is a fresh angle, but the story does not exploit it beyond premise. Temple-inscription decoding and shared-burden theme feel familiar; no surprising turn reconfigures expectations. Risk level is moderate.</comment>
