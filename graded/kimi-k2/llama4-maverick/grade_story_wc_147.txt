<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—her embodied dread and wonder ring true—but the “overriding instinct” beat is asserted rather than dramatized, blurring the micro-choice that should lock her arc. The final melancholy lands with cost, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse in-scene keeps the change from feeling fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple’s silence after energy harvest reweights Kael’s solitude with palpable loss. Causal chain holds (perfume guides → energy freed → memory preserved), though the “unsnarl” mechanics remain abstract. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The temple’s salt-rot and bioluminescent hush are selective and POV-filtered; the crystal vial doubles as micro-setting that literally lights her path. Final stillness reconfigures the space from living archive to empty ruin, charging the image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve civilization’s memory—tightens once: energy flow restored, temple falls silent. Agency is present (Kael’s frenzied final burst), but the escalation is more accumulative density than causal narrowing; cost is felt yet diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges organically from scent-triggered visions and the temple’s dying whispers. Final image of lingering perfume offers a non-moralizing, bittersweet reweighting. Avoids explicit thesis, though a touch of grandeur creeps in.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors Kael’s alternating awe and urgency. Sensory diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing (“lonesome splendor”) risks register drift but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean, propulsive, and image-dense. Minor loop: “lonesome splendor” appears twice without new charge; a few stacked modifiers (“great crystal orifice”) flirt with overwriting. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater temple as memory-archive is fresh, and the perfume-as-time-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric mode suits the stakes—but premise edges close to familiar “last guardian” tropes without radical inversion.</comment>
