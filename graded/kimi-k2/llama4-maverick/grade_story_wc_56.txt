<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “architecture of lies” remains an abstract label rather than a felt contradiction; the final self-reckoning is sketched rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—when the sundial’s glow reframes her past motives; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The canal’s damp decay and moonlit glints are selective and atmospheric; the sundial itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes—gaining hindsight clarity—tighten once when Lyra confronts her own false narratives; the deepening is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the price is implied rather than palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sundial’s literal function and Lyra’s self-interrogation; the ending’s quiet reweighting avoids moralizing, though the insight flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Lyra’s perceptual bias; patterned elision (“serene upheaval”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense, but occasional stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light”) and near-paraphrase loops slightly dilute momentum; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pocket-sundial-as-hindsight-device is a fresh synthesis; the canal setting and self-reckoning arc feel specific, though the “architecture of lies” concept edges toward familiar metaphor.</comment>
