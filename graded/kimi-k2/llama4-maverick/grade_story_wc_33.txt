<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“eyes fixed on the screens,” “tempest inside raged on”), motives are clear, and the final renunciation of safety carries a felt cost. Yet the “broken promises heal” motive is stated more than dramatized; a single embodied contradiction would push it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mailman’s quiet nod crystallizes risk and hope while drones still hum overhead. Causal chain holds—absence pattern → crossing → delivery—but the “linking absences” method is asserted rather than shown in scene, blurring the lens clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade’s neon and the alley’s shadows are sharply filtered through the mailman’s wary gaze, constraining his route and timing. The thunder-bottle functions as micro-setting, charging the final image; a stronger sensory anchor at the border itself would lift it to 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cross undetected to deliver hope—is signaled early and tightened once when the drone’s gaze forces the decisive sprint. Cost is present (risk of capture) yet remains abstract; a tangible forfeiture on the page would secure the higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption through clandestine connection emerges organically from the mailman’s choice; the storm-bottle reweights the premise as bottled hope rather than bottled fury. A touch of overt moralizing in the final paragraph caps the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to flickering neon and drone hum. Rhythm modulates well under pressure; only a few filter-verb clusters (“seemed to pulse,” “seemed to grow”) dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; each sentence advances image or tension. Occasional soft scaffolding (“the mailman had heard…”) and stock phrases (“weight of his task”) keep it from the 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The fusion of noir courier tropes with bottled weather feels fresh and inevitable; the drone border updates the smuggler mythos without gimmickry. One more specific, lived detail about the absence-pattern mechanics would nudge it past 8.0.</comment>
