<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s olfactory gift and her yearning for wisdom are sketched with sensory immediacy, but interior contradiction is thin; the “surge of energy” and instant harmony feel unearned, blunting the cost of her final serenity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: seed → bloom → expanded senses → earned stillness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the fragrance crystallizes her stance; cost is felt in the irrevocable shift of perception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The treetop canopy is filtered through Lyra’s nose and fingertips; scent, texture, and altitude constrain her movements and charge the final “wildflower hush.” Micro-setting (seed, journal, wrapping paper) functions as extension of body and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to the undercurrent of wisdom—tightens as the tide’s thought turns; the corpse flower’s brief bloom narrows options to a single inhalation that reconfigures her world. Agency is present but cushioned by lyric inevitability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of attuned stillness within flux emerges through scent, doodles, and the bloom’s ephemerality; no moralizing, only a final image that reweights prior motifs. Subtext whispers in the “wildflower hush” rather than declaring wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice stays close to Lyra’s perceptual field; diction is arboreal, synesthetic, and rhythmically hushed. No dialogue, but internal texture is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional scent-laden strings verge on purple but are anchored in POV. No loops or scaffold, and the final cadence breathes with the bloom’s brief life.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar “mystic herbalist” frame is refreshed by olfactory synesthesia and the wrapping-paper doodle ritual; the corpse flower’s decade bloom feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
