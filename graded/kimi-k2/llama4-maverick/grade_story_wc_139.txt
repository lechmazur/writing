<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the ink pot and her layered feelings about her father’s trade are embodied—but her final resolve feels more declared than earned; the ink pot’s “surge of determination” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs her something concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a single, coherent scene and uses a Causal lens: father negotiates → director hesitates → breach proposed. Closure is a Charged Poise (“she would be ready…”), but the cost is only implied; a more palpable forfeiture would push it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep-room’s sterile chill and the ink pot’s weight are sharply rendered; the ink pot itself functions as micro-setting that reframes Lena’s tactics. Spatial anchors are clear, but the room’s physical constraints never actually limit or enable the impending breach, keeping it just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to risk complicity in the asylum grift—escalates from observation to potential action. The tightening beat is the father’s “small act of defiance” proposal, but the cost remains abstract; we feel tension yet no tangible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of moral calculus (“mathematics of a fair trade”) emerges organically from Lena’s reflections and the ink pot’s shifting symbolism. It avoids overt moralizing, but the final image doesn’t quite reweight the premise—Lena’s stance crystallizes without a new, undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, tactile, and slightly noir-tinged (“morbid beauty,” “deathly vitality”). Free-indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. The rhythmic control falters only in occasional soft filler (“she began to think about…”), keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with strong nouns and verbs; occasional loops (“the ink pot… the ink pot…”) and mild scaffolding (“she felt a warmth spread”) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift, but a few filter verbs keep it from the 9+ tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The con-artist/funeral-home pairing feels fresh, and the ink pot as moral lens is an elegant device. Yet the core beats—negotiate, hesitate, propose breach—follow a recognizable heist-family template without a transformative twist that would make it unforgettable.</comment>
