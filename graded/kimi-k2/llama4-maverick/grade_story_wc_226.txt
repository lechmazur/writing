<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; the artist’s “defiance” and “mischievous glint” never translate into a concrete micro-choice that alters her path. The final “peace” feels asserted rather than earned by prior embodied struggle. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the mist parts to reveal etched symbols—yet the cost is only vaguely “terrible/beautiful,” not legible on the page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of refracting poetry tightens once, but causality between poem and spire revelation remains opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Canyon of bone and pale spire are vividly evoked; the spire’s etched symbols finally constrain meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchoring is clear early. Selective sensory detail (mist refracting rainbows) supports atmosphere without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“price of forgiveness”—is declared repeatedly but never tested in a beat that narrows options or exacts a visible price. Pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally; no concrete trade-off is dramatized before the closing image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges through refracted truths and mist imagery rather than direct statement. Final image reweights prior material, but ambiguity tips toward vagueness rather than resonant complexity. Subtext is present yet thin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“voice would refract the air”). No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich; occasional stacked metaphors (“towers of bone pierced the sky like shattered splinters”) verge on excess but do not muddle causality. No loops or scaffold detected. High information density maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Refracting truth through poetry in a bone-canyon is fresh, yet the execution leans on familiar lyric tropes. The synthesis feels inevitable but not startling; risk-taking is moderate. Specificity of “etched symbols” offers a fresh inflection.</comment>
