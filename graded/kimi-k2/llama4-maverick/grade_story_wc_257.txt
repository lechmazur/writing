<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (“teach withering to bloom”) is declared early and recurs, but interiority drifts into abstract lyricism rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels lightly earned rather than paid for. Micro-choices (weaving, placing origami) align with motive yet lack visible cost or risk. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory brightens, curtains peak, and the maker’s subdued ardor rekindles with a felt shift in stance. Causal chain (origami → star alignment → curtain glow → brooch) is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory is vividly anchored—“domed glass ceiling,” “sandalwood and myrrh”—and the curtains’ liquid shimmer constrains the final craft choice. Sensory selection narrows under urgency: starlight kaleidoscope mirrors inner turmoil. Micro-setting (bench, stencil) functions as charged objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is reviving the maker’s wilted passion; pressure tightens as each origami incrementally brightens the curtains, forcing a final craft act. Cost is conceptual—grief transmuted—but still legible. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-art emerges organically from the maker’s tactile labor and the curtains’ response. Final image of the stencil shimmering reweights earlier grief without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no late thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet consistent, with controlled psychic distance and sensory specificity. No dialogue; free-indirect texture sustains interiority. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments at peak light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with strong verbs and selective figurative language. Occasional mild loop (“as they worked… as they worked”) and elevated diction (“transcended their individual sorrow”) nudge down from 8.0. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mourning-jewelry maker reviving self via star-woven curtains is fresh, yet the cosmic origami mechanic feels lightly sketched rather than boldly re-imagined. Specificity of craft details lifts it above template. Risk is moderate; transformation is internal.</comment>
