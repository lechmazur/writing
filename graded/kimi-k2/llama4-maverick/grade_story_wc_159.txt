<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The caretaker’s interiority is consistent and embodied—her “gently systematic precision” is shown in tactile orchid care—but the story never forces her to a costly choice; her motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers sensory density until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing orchids and lingering chime crystallize the caretaker’s endless task with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal library, wind chime, and orchids form a micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the only tools for the caretaker’s ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the cracked bamboo tube’s light literally guides the final gesture, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepened through the song’s echo, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no single beat narrows options or exacts a new price. The caretaker’s stance crystallizes, yet pressure feels diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s fragility emerges organically from the caretaker’s ritual and the museum of extinct feelings. The final image of glowing orchids offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: preservation is both beauty and burden. Subtext in the cracked chime’s “foxglove regret” is subtle and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the caretaker’s methodical care. Perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to texture, light, and sound. No head-hopping; diction stays within the caretaker’s contemplative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned early and paid off in the alchemy of light on glass. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“velvety softness of foxglove regret”) risks register drift yet remains coherent to voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>The glass-orchid caretaker in a cloudborne library of extinct feelings is a fresh synthesis; the cracked wind chime as memory conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
