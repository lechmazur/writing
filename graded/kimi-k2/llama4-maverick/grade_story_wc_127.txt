<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dealer’s interiority is evocative—“subsume her own emotions like a tool”—but her choices remain observational; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics or forecloses a path, so the arc feels static rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the amber grotto’s glow thickens like honey, reweighting the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the grotto seemed to whisper its approval”—but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt by the dealer, so the beat lands softly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s luminescent stones and aged-amber scent are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the crafted emotions; the setting’s warmth literally infuses the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—delivering nuanced counterfeit emotion—remains abstract; pressure never tightens through a concrete test or trade-off, so escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of half-truths emerges organically from the dealer’s craft; the final image of the grotto “holding the memory” offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting, though the conceptual cost is gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with tactile diction—“velvety petal,” “softly crackling stones”—and a controlled psychic distance that modulates with dusk’s deepening; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional soft loops (“the dealer felt… the dealer’s task…”) are minor and do not stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The counterfeit-emotion premise is fresh, and the fusion of olfactory craft with emotional fabrication feels specific; risk is moderate, but the synthesis is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
