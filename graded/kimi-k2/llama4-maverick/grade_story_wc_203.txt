<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ezra’s contradictory motive—repairing elevators while drawn by ghosts—is credibly embodied in her tactile handling of dust and barrel; final “weightless burden” earns the renunciation because her micro-choice to keep the logbook and mainspring forecloses another entry to this office. One slip: “gentle curves of metal” drifts toward catalog prose rather than embodied need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust > logbook > ghosts > mainspring recharging final image. A single deepening suffices: the barrel revealed as “key” narrows Ezra’s stance and legibly closes before/after. Cost feels in the hush before city-noise returns, though lightly felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ticket-office relics provide tactile props that guide Ezra’s fingers to hidden compartment; ceiling fluorescents “like skeletal fingers” physically mirror descent into past. Setting stays live—dust trail on counter literally steers discovery. Could sharpen one spatial constraint (locked door) to hit 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can ghosts be given voice before site is erased? One meaningful intensification: reading logbook shifts her from observer to carrier of stories, narrowing exit options. Cost is quiet—perpetual stewardship—but present when she smiles into “weightless burden.”</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvage versus erasure emerges through concrete handling of objects (barrel, logbook) rather than statement. Final re-seeing of abandoned circus as “strange beauty” offers non-moral repricing of decay. Sentimentality avoided via corporeal dust and tool hum.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Ezra’s ghost-touched perceptions; selective sensory filter (dust taste, metal resonance) gives perceptual signature. Repetition of “weightless burden” risks mantra, but final cadence justifies with hush-crescendo. One phrase drifts: “cracks in the façade of… place” is authorial meta-speech, not her voice.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes under atmospheric pressure—short pulse of finding logbook, slower linger on ghosts crystallizing. Near-loop “dust accumulates… dust… dust trail” is minor; clarity intact. Metaphors are spare and physical (“hum of the mainspring”) rather than ornament for its own sake.</comment>

<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Occupational cross-haunting—elevator tech + ghost seer—feels non-obvious and lived rather than gimmick. Barrel as quasi-séance artifact synthesizes timekeeping, circus spectacle, and repair craft. Fresh enough despite familiar haunted-place frame.</comment>
