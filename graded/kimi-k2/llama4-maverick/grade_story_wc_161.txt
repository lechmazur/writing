<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s interiority is vivid—her meticulous paper-trail habit and dust-mote ritual are embodied and specific—but the “reinvented past” remains abstract, never crystallizing into a single, costly choice on the page. The emotional arc (learning to trust) is sketched more than dramatized; we infer change rather than witness a decisive beat. Secondary pressure is absent, yet the single-POV focus holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of dust motes and departing pigeon crystallizes Emilia’s earned poise, the cost being her acceptance of an unverifiable past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dust, paper, birds layers toward this charged stillness. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The attic’s sensory density (must, skylight glow, cooing) is selective and purposeful, constraining Emilia’s ritual space. The Mars chip and meteorite dust subtly mirror her alienation, charging the final gaze outward. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes—secrecy vs. connection—are signaled early and tightened through the daily dust-mote ritual, but no single beat forces a trade-off with visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal; tension accrues but never snaps. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a visceral test.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciling fabricated past with present need emerges through image and ritual, never stated. The “echo of lost songs” motif resonates without moralizing, though its final reprise is gentle rather than revelatory. Complexity acknowledged, ambiguity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Emilia’s precise, slightly detached perception. Syntax mirrors her cataloguing mind; no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, so evaluation rests on narrative texture, which remains distinct and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language (“paper trails…woven with the precision of a master seamstress”) is apt. Occasional soft-focus phrasing (“bloom of withering”) edges toward poetic excess but does not obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>

<comment>Familiar elements (lonely archivist, messenger pigeons, meteorite keepsake) are refreshed by the dust-mote meditation and paper-trail metaphor. The synthesis feels organic, though not radically surprising. Risk is modest; ingenuity lies in texture, not twist.</comment>
