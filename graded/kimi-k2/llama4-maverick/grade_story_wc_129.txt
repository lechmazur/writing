<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s longing to belong is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a single high-stakes choice; the “boldly sympathetic” trait is label-only. The final acceptance feels gifted rather than earned through a visible cost. Interiority drifts into abstract “webs of kinship” rather than concrete contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—community embrace—but the causal chain is thin: the arbor’s presentation is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is only asserted. The search for the tag supplies a single beat of shared action yet resolves the isolation arc too easily. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds but lacks tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard is vividly sketched and returns in the moonlit final image, charging the closure with luminescent ache. Spatial anchors are clear early; however, the crater edge never constrains any tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early but pressure plateaus after the tag discovery; no meaningful tightening or trade-off is dramatized. The community’s acceptance arrives as gift, not earned reversal. Agency is limited to observing connections rather than risking anything tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges through imagery rather than statement, culminating in the arbor as communal symbol. Subtext is present but muted; no credible counter-reading complicates the warm resolution. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature favors shimmering, synesthetic diction that suits Kael’s artistic lens. Rhythm modulates with emotional rise, though occasional “as if” clauses dilute immediacy. Voice remains coherent across the lyrical drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, yet loops of “shimmer,” “luminescent,” and “webs” recur without new pressure. Mixed metaphors (“physical manifestation of webs”) slightly blur clarity. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of marsh-reed sculptor with crystalline orchard feels fresh; the arbor as living kinship map is a non-obvious synthesis. Familiar “outsider finds home” arc is redeemed by specificity of craft and setting. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
