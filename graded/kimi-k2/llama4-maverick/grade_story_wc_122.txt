<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “coaxing out a hidden melody” and her humming “drawing the shadows closer” embody emotion without labels. Yet her arc drifts: the numbness is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice; the final “peace” arrives more by accumulation than by a visible renunciation or cost. The broken needle is symbolic backdrop, not a crucible that forces her to act differently. Result: strong texture, weaker earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: seasons rustle, hush thickens, numbness recedes. Closure is a Charged Poise—“a new melody began to take shape”—that reweights the premise with felt cost (the silence she now inhabits). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. However, the tightening is diffuse; the story circles rather than narrows, so the cost is atmospheric rather than sharply legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern’s damp earth, worn tool handles, and “sweet aroma of freshly cut wood” are selective and POV-filtered. The drum surfaces vibrating under Aria’s touch let the setting act as micro-environment that constrains her tactile exploration. Seasons outside serve as temporal heartbeat, but the cavern itself does not evolve or impose a final constraint, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early. Pressure rises texturally: seasons turn, hush thickens, wonder creeps in. Yet no single beat forces a trade-off or visible price; the numbness simply lifts. Escalation is present but gentle, lacking the tightening that would foreclose an option or exact a cost on the page.</comment>

<comment>Theme of silence-as-music emerges organically from Aria’s tactile listening and reversed songs. The final image of “a new melody… in the stillness” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is strong—shadows lean closer, walls “hold their breath”—but occasional lines (“world full of hidden patterns”) edge toward abstraction, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and sensorily precise: “earthy scent of damp soil mingled with the sweet aroma of freshly cut wood.” Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; short, insistent clauses under pressure. No dialogue, so no register drift. The perceptual signature—Aria’s synesthetic attention to vibration—remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and largely loop-free. Occasional soft repeats (“as the seasons turned… as the seasons continued their gentle turn”) create minor cadence loops, but they do not stall momentum or cloud closure. Metaphors are apt and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles. High information density with purposeful paragraphing.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a deaf music teacher crafting silence into music is fresh, and the reversed-song device is handled with quiet originality rather than gimmickry. Tropes of healing-through-art are subverted by the refusal of overt sound. Specificity of the drum-maker’s cavern and tactile listening keeps it from feeling generic. Risk is moderate; payoff is coherent.</comment>
