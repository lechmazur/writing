<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the dusk noticer’s motives (“preserve the shape of hope”) are declared rather than embodied in decisive micro-choices. The river stone warms, yet this physical cue never forces a visible trade-off or action that forecloses a path. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; the arc drifts toward realization rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise—she “disappears into the clouds” with new insight—but the cost is only asserted (“weight of her task”) not dramatized. Causality is loose: the pattern she traces in the footage never narrows her options on the page; the shadow remains atmospheric rather than a force that compels a final decision. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The blooming library’s floating shelves and luminescent orbs create a vivid, consistent micro-setting that mirrors the theme of shared dreams. Sensory detail is selective—parchment scent, hovering orbs—filtered through the noticer’s scholarly gaze. However, the environment never materially constrains her choices; it remains backdrop rather than tactical resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—stemming the “shadow unbound” that feeds on collective fear—is declared early but never tested in a beat that narrows her tactics. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the footage reveals a pattern yet never forces a choice with visible cost. Escalation is implied rather than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of hope versus creeping collective despair emerges through recurring images of light and shadow rather than exposition. The luminous regret motif threads through the final image, reweighting the library’s glow as fragile beacon. Subtext is present but muted; no single moment crystallizes the thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured—“softly deliberate fingers,” “luminous regret”—with rhythmic control that matches the meditative pace. POV remains tightly anchored to the dusk noticer; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are purposeful, taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished, with varied sentence rhythm and vivid diction. Occasional abstractions (“inexplicable connection,” “shape of hope”) slightly dilute density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; metaphors remain coherent. High-band polish marred only by soft, summary phrasing near the end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—shared dreams and a librarian who studies them via archival footage—offers a fresh angle on collective unconscious tropes. Details feel specific to this world rather than generic. The synthesis of library, stone, and shadow is organic, though the shadow’s agency could be more distinctive.</comment>
