<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s quiet rebellion is stated but never tested against external pressure; her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“auroral sorrow”) rather than embodied contradiction. The shared-dream motive is declared early yet never collides with a tangible obstacle, so the final peace feels pre-approved. No micro-choice visibly forecloses a path; the story ends in stasis rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the lagoon dims but its glow “lingers,” reconfiguring the stake from loss to continuity. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—drumming intensifies light, light intensifies sorrow—but the tightening is modest; the universe’s “hush” is more mood than constraint. Orientation is clear by 120 words, and the lens holds, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The sound-wave garden’s petal-resonance and auric lagoon are vivid, selective, and filtered through Aria’s perception. The lagoon’s glow evolves from beacon to fading ember, charging the final image. Micro-setting—the metallic perch—constrains her drumming posture and thus the sound propagation. No spatial contradictions; the garden feels tactile and lived-in.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: preserve the shared dream against inevitable fade. Pressure rises only via lyrical intensification (“drumming grew more insistent”) rather than narrowing options. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized; the sorrow is aesthetic, not tactical. The final poise is graceful but lacks a visible price that alters next moves.</comment>

<comment>Theme of collective memory emerges through image and action rather than statement. The sorrow’s auroral tint reweights the dream’s fragility at the end. Subtext is present—silence as shared secret—but the piece edges toward soft abstraction (“truth that only revealed itself in the silence”). Complexity is acknowledged yet not fully embodied in choice.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent (“petal-like structures resonated with every vibration”). Rhythm modulates with emotional swell, and no POV leakage occurs. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral sorrow”) is voice-motivated and patterned early. No dialogue to test naturalism.</comment>

<comment>Prose is fluid and imagistic, but mild loops appear: “sound waves…resonated…vibrations” and “glow…glow…light” within two sentences. No mixed metaphors, yet density dips into decorative repetition. Sentence rhythm breathes with the beats, and no scaffolding stalls momentum. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden as memory therapy grounds a fresh angle on the trope of shared consciousness. Drumming as interface is specific and non-obvious. The piece avoids genre clichés but leans on familiar lyric sorrow; the transformation is more atmospheric than conceptual. Risk is moderate, coherence high.</comment>
