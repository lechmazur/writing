<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ava’s “culture-shock absorber” role is stated, but interiority stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The final stance is declared, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis—residents ready to resist—but the shift from carnival joy to militant unity is summarized, not staged. Causal linkage between graffiti and mobilization is asserted rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival is sketched with vivid sensory cues (food smells, music) and the foundation-stone chip anchors memory. Spatial choreography is loose; we never see the chip handled after its first mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the city’s soul—is clear early. Escalation is narrated (“graffiti spread…unity grew”) without on-page tightening or felt price; pressure remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective resistance to commodification emerges through images rather than slogans. Final paragraph edges toward moral summary (“testament to the strength of community”), blunting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person lens is stable, but voice defaults to editorial omniscience. Sensory details are filtered through generic civic pride rather than Ava’s idiosyncratic perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, yet phrases like “hopeful desperation” and “perpetual carnival” repeat without deepening. No line-level artifacts, but density is modest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gentrifying raft-city carnival is fresh; graffiti as coded resistance is familiar but well-synced. Risk is muted—no structural daring—yet the synthesis feels specific.</comment>
