<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the adjuster’s motives remain generalized (“deep-seated need to protect”) rather than rooted in specific, contradictory impulses. The broken puppet head is handled, yet its emotional valence is asserted rather than dramatized. No clear internal conflict or visible cost is attached to the final lullaby, so the renunciation feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lullaby spreads across the hush, reweighting the premise with felt awe. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hidden lighthouse at dusk is evoked with selective sensory strokes; glass pane and lantern room constrain movement and amplify hush. Micro-setting (broken puppet head as tactile focus) functions as charged object. While broader geography is vague, the immediate environment guides the adjuster’s delicate gestures and frames the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving temporal balance—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: deepening hush and slowing dusk mirror rising solemnity. No decisive tightening of options or visible price is dramatized; the lullaby succeeds without evident trade-off, muting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile beauty amid cosmic duty emerges through recurring images of cracks and hush rather than statement. Subtext resides in the adjuster’s gentle caress of brokenness. Final lullaby offers resonant, non-literal answer, though thematic complexity leans toward awe rather than interrogation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific: “pane of hush,” “bruised awe.” Syntax modulates with dusk’s fade. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within adjuster’s plausible lexicon. Patterned repetition (“hush,” “broken”) is deliberate and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic, with purposeful compression. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the elevated register. Minor scaffold: repeated “hush” and “broken” risk loop, but cadence justifies. No clarity issues or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—cosmic clock adjuster in hidden lighthouse—feels fresh yet inevitable. Broken puppet head as temporal key is non-obvious and thematically fertile. Risk-taking lies in quiet lyricism over plot; transformation test passes: specificity of lighthouse dusk and cracked porcelain anchors the concept.</comment>
