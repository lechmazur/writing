<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity and functional creativity are stated but never embodied in contradiction or struggle; the sextant guides without friction, and her “stoic wonder” feels performed rather than earned. No interior conflict complicates the resurrection task, so the final choice lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern of “discover–restore–glow” repeats without tightening or deepening; the closure image of the glowing terminal is lovely but does not reweight the premise or foreclose a path. No felt cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terminal’s rusted pipes and dim halls are vivid and selective, but the setting never constrains Maya’s choices or charges the final image; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“new equations for hope”—is declared early but remains abstract; the resurrection proceeds without meaningful tightening or trade-off, and the maze of intentions never tests Maya’s commitment with a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth emerges through imagery rather than assertion, yet the lack of embodied cost keeps it from resonating beyond the literal restoration; the final paragraph edges into moralizing (“reminder that even in the darkest of times…”) which blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent and unobtrusive, but the perceptual signature is generic; no idiosyncratic diction or rhythm distinguishes Maya’s interiority, and the prose modulates little under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and readable, with occasional elegant phrases (“dusty surfaces gleaming with a newfound light”), yet it leans on stock cadences and near-paraphrase loops (“a sense of wonder, a sense of awe”). No artifacts obscure closure, but density is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The abandoned-terminal resurrection is familiar; the sextant and maze add texture but do not transform the trope. Specific details feel fresh enough to avoid cliché, yet the arc remains safely conventional.</comment>
