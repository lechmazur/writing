<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mage’s “earnestly naive” trait is embodied in the slow, meticulous ritual and the swelling pride afterward, but interior contradiction is muted; the devotion is declared rather than tested under duress, so the cost feels gentle rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s toll crystallizes the mage’s stance and reweights the world’s balance. Causal chain is clear—ritual drip → bell rebirth → cosmic shift—yet the “cosmic imbalance” remains abstract, blunting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sapphire viaduct at dawn is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the bell’s glow; the salt-fish scent and cracked bell ground the scene. However, the setting constrains choice only atmospherically, not tactically, keeping it just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“right a cosmic imbalance”—is signaled early and tightened through the ritual’s precision. Pressure is coherent but abstract; the bell’s repair is the single meaningful turn, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of brittle devotion emerges organically from the bell’s fracture and gradual mending, avoiding overt moralizing. The final toll offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the cosmic scale keeps the emotional bite diffuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that matches the drip-drop cadence of the ritual. Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift or register clash. Occasional elevated phrasing (“plausible impossibility”) edges toward self-consciousness but stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. A few near-repetitive constructions (“mage’s thoughts turned…”) and mild scaffold (“the mage knew…”) slightly dull momentum, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of magical repair ritual with emotional restoration of “brittle devotion” feels fresh, and the drip-rate precision is a novel mechanic. Yet the cosmic framing leans on familiar epic registers, muting full originality.</comment>
