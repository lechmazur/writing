<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” label is evocative but never enacted; we never see her dive, salvage, or negotiate with ghosts. Interiority is poetic but abstract (“felt the weight of her story”), lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Motivation (“salvage something pure”) is stated repeatedly yet never tested by a visible decision or sacrifice. The final step into the glacier reads as image, not act, so no earned cost or change is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric reprise—melted snow globe now empty, shrine glowing—creating a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of images (candle, ice, starlight) intensifies toward final glow, yet no single beat narrows options or forces a decisive change. Orientation is clear early, but causality between vision and action remains soft (“she stepped out… ready to face whatever lay ahead” is prospective, not enacted).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly etched—ice shrine, melting candles, swirling globe—each image mirrored in Aria’s perception. The shrine’s cold and flicker subtly constrain posture and breath, and the globe’s final empty state recharges the closing image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though occasionally ornamental (“borrowed starlight” repeated). Spatial anchors hold; glacier expanse remains more backdrop than tactical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is declared but never sharpened by an on-page test or irreversible trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (whispers, visions) rather than causal; no single beat escalates cost or forecloses an option. The final widening of “windows of connection” feels like expansion, not tightening. Agency is contemplative; no decision or renunciation carries visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through recurring images of threads, windows, and starlight, avoiding direct statement. Subtext is strongest in the empty globe’s final pattern, hinting that purity is absence rather than retrieval. Yet the theme remains somewhat abstract, lacking a concrete ethical dilemma or counter-reading. Emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder rather than lingering disquiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually filtered through Aria’s heightened senses. Syntax modulates with intensity—short pulses during vision, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence is internal only. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ethereal glow,” “moonless night”) edges toward poetic template but stays within tolerable range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free, with rhythmic variety and vivid sensory nouns. Minor scaffold phrases (“the weight of her story,” “fragile beauty”) recur without adding pressure. Metaphors are coherent but occasionally stacked (“broken shell,” “swirling mixture,” “threads that bound”). No line-level artifact obscures closure, but density could be higher for this length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-diving ghost whisperer in glacial shrine—offers fresh synthesis of salvage spirituality and psychic cartography. Tropes (ghosts, visions, starlight) are re-textured through ice and melted globe rather than generic occult décor. The final empty globe as emblem of connection is a subtle inversion. Risk is moderate; concept could be pushed further into lived consequence.</comment>
