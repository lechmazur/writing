<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is present but abstract; researcher’s motives (teach delayed revelation) are stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses on page; student remains passive receptor. Closure smile is earned but cost is diffuse—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of withheld detail and rippling pond reweights perception. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—student’s “perfect clarity” reconfigures understanding—but cost is conceptual only, not dramatized. Orientation is clear; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is evocatively anchored (floating rock, sycamore hush, lapping water). Magnetic grotto is mentioned but never physically constrains choice; it remains atmospheric. Micro-setting (pond rings) does guide lesson metaphorically, meeting 9+ gate partially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is student’s comprehension of vanishing. Pressure tightens via withheld details and trance deepening, but escalation is gentle—no live option foreclosed, no tangible price paid. Agency lies with researcher’s pacing, not student’s risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of delayed revelation emerges through withheld truth and ripple metaphor; avoids overt statement. Final image of “flower opening to the sun” is resonant but slightly clichéd, muting reweighting. Complexity is present yet leans toward affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, consistent with meditative frame. Perceptual signature is serene but not sharply idiosyncratic. No dialogue; narration stays within POV bounds. Rhythm modulates with trance depth, supporting atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and sensory-rich. Occasional soft filler (“gentle lapping,” “serene sycamore hush”) and mild template cadence (“As she…, she…”) slightly dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or line-level artifacts in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise of teaching vanishing via delayed revelation is fresh; execution feels contemplative rather than risk-taking. Rippling pond as pedagogical tool is specific and memorable. Avoids genre clichés but also avoids bold structural or moral gambits.</comment>
