<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The herald’s interiority is lyrical but generic; “shadowed elation” and “ancient shadows” read as labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—her ritual proceeds without friction or felt cost. The character remains a graceful archetype rather than an individual whose flaws complicate the dawn-steering task.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the dawn arrives and the herald walks away, her task “done,” yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the ritual’s steps feel predetermined. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene default is met, but the ending’s reweighting is more decorative than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and star-field are vividly sketched and return in the final image, charging the closure with color and vertical scale. Sensory selection is biased toward light/shadow, matching the POV’s obsession, though tactile detail is thin. The setting constrains movement—spiral stairs, lantern angles—so environment shapes tactics just enough to clear the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“shape the coming day”—remain abstract; no concrete consequence of failure is tested on the page. Pressure tightens only in cadence, not in options foreclosed. The herald’s agency is absolute; she steers without resistance, so escalation is atmospheric rather than causal. A single tightening beat is present but lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuity versus digital ephemerality flickers in the “last print newspaper” line but never complicates the ritual. The motif of light/shadow recurs, yet its final reprise does not reweight the premise—dawn simply arrives. Subtext is gestural; meaning is asserted more than discovered through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and slightly archaic, suiting the mythic register. Compression and patterned repetition (“the herald… the herald…”) are deliberate and legible. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on the narrator’s cadence, which holds. Occasional poetic abstractions drift toward the generic but stay within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops, though phrases like “light coalescing into a new reality” edge toward abstraction. Rhythm modulates with ascent and dawn. A few stacked modifiers (“soft, ethereal light”) could be tighter, but no artifact obscures clarity or dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-dawn-steering conceit is fresh, synthesizing optics myth and post-print nostalgia. Yet the execution leans on familiar lyric fantasy cadences rather than risk. Specificity of the “total internal reflection” mechanic is underused; the story does not fully mine its own premise, keeping originality solid but not dazzling.</comment>
