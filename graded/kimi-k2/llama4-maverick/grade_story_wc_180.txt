<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her muttering to trees, tying the ribbon—but the breach-of-contract backstory is delivered in a single expository block that never tilts her present tactics, so the “deciduous vows” remain thematic rather than lived contradiction. Aria’s return is sketched rather than dramatized, muting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s thriving and Aria’s return reconfigure the meaning of the vows without resolving them tidily. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat adds density until the final image—but the causal hinge (why these seeds now?) is soft, kept from 8+ by that unmotivated timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is tactile and specific—stone columns, rafters, birdsong—and the ribbon-as-micro-setting constrains Elara’s ritual gesture. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the orchard’s sudden pilgrimage influx feels off-stage, slightly diluting the environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—remains coherent; pressure tightens when forgotten seeds sprout, visibly reweighting the orchard. Cost is diffuse (years of solitary labor) rather than crystallized in a single beat, so escalation feels accumulative rather than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of accidental wisdom emerges organically from Elara’s persistence and the orchard’s unplanned flourishing; no moral is stated. The ribbon’s reprise at the end reweights the mother-daughter rift without resolving it, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—her “gentle reverence” and feisty muttering. Syntax modulates with emotional cadence; no head-hopping. Only minor register drift (“deciduous vows” feels slightly analytic for her idiom).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous in nature”) momentarily lifts out of Elara’s earthy lexicon but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of cathedral ruin and living orchard feels fresh; the “deciduous vows” metaphor is non-obvious and thematically integral. Risk-taking is moderate—quiet lyricism over plot pyrotechnics—but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
