<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid (“sense of lacy menace”), but her contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final step into the grotto feels inevitable yet the cost is only asserted, not embodied. Companion remains a cipher, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the queen steps into the grotto, reconfiguring her stance with “no return.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—bleeding starlight intensifies pattern rather than forcing choice. Orientation is clear early, but the final beat states rather than dramatizes cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cobalt and ember grottos are evoked with sensory precision (“fiery heart still burning bright”), and the setting’s lacy glow constrains the queen’s perception of menace. The environment subtly guides her final step, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel the dreams—is signaled early; pressure deepens via bleeding starlight’s intensification. One tightening beat: she steps into the grotto, foreclosing retreat. Cost is declared (“change her forever”) but not yet felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of reality’s fraying emerges through starlight and dream imagery rather than statement. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the queen accepts irreversible knowledge. Subtext in shared exhale and fireflies is effective, though slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature is queen-centric (“shimmering expanse of silk”). Compression and elision are purposeful. Dialogue is minimal but natural. No POV drift; diction stays within elevated royal register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and propulsive, but occasional purple stacks (“living, breathing entity, pulsing with a malevolent energy”) slightly dilute urgency. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Familiar gothic-fantasy tropes (bleeding starlight, ancient fire) are refreshed through tactile specificity and restrained lyricism. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically fresh; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
