<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is evocative but abstract; her “serenely electric” state is repeated rather than embodied. The Hollywood fragment and the shard of hush function as talismans, yet her choices remain interpretive rather than decisive—no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. Motivation (“find the beginning in every ending”) is stated, not dramatized under pressure. Closure is an earned mood, not a costly act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers sensory fragments until the final crystallization. Closure is a Charged Poise—the city’s silhouette “whispers” a reconfiguration of meaning, cost felt as irrevocable wonder. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props. Minor drift: the shard’s causal role is more thematic than tactical, slightly softening the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended radio-tower city is vividly sketched—“ozone and decay,” “creaking rusty metal”—and the gorge’s drop charges every step with latent danger. The Hollywood star fragment acts as micro-setting, its glint guiding Aria to the hidden chamber. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One missed beat: the city’s former vitality is told, not tactically used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the shard of hush—remains abstract; tension is atmospheric, not option-narrowing. No on-page reversal or trade-off; pressure accumulates but never tightens. Cost is diffuse wonder rather than forfeiture. Coincidence (finding the fragment) complicates acceptably, yet agency stays interpretive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-decay emerges through imagery, not statement. The shard of hush reweights from mystery to elegy in the final silhouette. Subtext is present—nostalgia for an era never known—but the epiphany leans toward articulated insight (“reminder that even in decay, there was beauty”). Resists tidy moral, lingers in mood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Aria’s sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—“celestial whispers,” “serenely electric.” Rhythm modulates with scene intensity. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly glow”) fits the lyric mode and is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence lengths vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned, rarely muddled. One paraphrase loop: “serenely electric” appears twice without added pressure. Otherwise high information density—“hum of abandoned radio towers” does triple sensory work. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned city, lunar perigee, nostalgic fragment—are re-inflected through celestial signal interpretation. The shard of hush as acoustic relic is fresh. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyricism over plot. Specificity of the gorge-suspended towers anchors the fantasy. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without this exact setting-object dyad.</comment>
