<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the map-maker’s contradictory impulses (“chart” vs. “be drawn”) remain stated rather than embodied in a single decisive micro-choice. The withheld-truth motive is announced, not dramatized through visible stakes or cost. The final stance crystallizes, yet the price feels diffuse—wonder without forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the multiverse is “never seen the same way again.” However, the lens drifts between Accumulative/Textural and Situational; the doorway’s rules are never constrained, so causality feels ornamental. Cost is asserted (“changed forever”) rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repair-bay rust and wreckage are sharply sketched, and the green shard’s evolving glow supplies micro-setting pressure. Yet the spaceport never limits her tactics; it serves mainly as mood. The shard’s final fade recharges the image, but the bay itself does not constrain the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—is clear early. Pressure escalates texturally through kaleidoscopic shifts, but each world blurs into the next without a tightening choice that forecloses an option. The final “clarity” arrives as declaration, not a tested trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual reconfiguration emerges implicitly from the journey’s accumulation. The withheld truth remains abstract, however, so the conceptual repricing is felt more as mood than as reweighted moral calculus. Resonance is present but not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and sensorily biased (“murmur of half-remembered dreams”). Patterned elision (“worlds continued to shift and blur”) is taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “labyrinthine”) edges toward register drift but stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and strong sensory nouns. Minor loop risk in repeated “worlds…worlds” phrasing and stacked modifiers (“kaleidoscope of images and sensations”) but never stalls momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The portal-hopping quest is familiar, yet the sensory-map-maker lens and the shard-as-talisman give it fresh texture. The withheld-truth angle gestures toward conceptual novelty but stays abstract. Risk is moderate; transformation is felt more in mood than in premise.</comment>
