<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority drifts toward cosmic exposition rather than embodied contradiction; “quietly enthusiastic” is asserted, never dramatized in micro-choice. No visible cost when the droplet is drunk; the alignment feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—wavelength aligned, prophecy set—but causality is thin: coins → static → distillation → alignment happens without intermediate reversals or stakes. Orientation holds; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Observatory deck, coins, and distillation apparatus are vividly sketched and filter through POV. Yet the setting never constrains choice; it’s backdrop rather than crucible. Micro-setting (the droplet) charges the final image, lifting score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“align with purpose”—is declared but not tested; no tightening of options or visible price. Escalation is atmospheric (stars brighten) rather than causal. Agency is observational until the final swallow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of cosmic alignment versus individual doubt emerges implicitly through imagery. Subtext is present but undercut by overt statements (“wavelength align with purpose”). Resonates, yet avoids deeper moral or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and cosmically inflected; perceptual signature is distinct. Repetition of “quietly enthusiastic” and “stellar doubt” edges toward template cadence but stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; sensory layering is purposeful. Occasional loops (“the decision maker felt…”) and stacked modifiers (“sweet, pungent aroma…”) slightly dull propulsion. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of divination via static bursts and alchemical distillation feels fresh. Premise is high-concept but grounded in tactile ritual. Risk is moderate; transformation is more atmospheric than structural.</comment>
