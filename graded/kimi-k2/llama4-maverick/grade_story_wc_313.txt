<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The warden’s motivation is clear—heal the town—but interiority tends toward summative, not contradictory, emotion. One micro-choice (store the liqueur label) lightly signals care beneath duty, yet no competing impulse surfaces under pressure. Endurance rather than revelation closes the arc; cost is implied but not paid in the present beat, keeping the stance static rather than evolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: patterned tightening via photographs links beats of decay toward a resonant stillness. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—“a precisely humane endeavor… silent now”—but lack of a demonstrable pivot or new constraint undercuts causal impact. Anchors clear early; no Orientation dent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mud-reek detail, toy, creaking sign—all selective, POV-filtered, sucking the reader into the hollow town. The midnight ridgeway sets the final image’s hush; setting pressure is textural, not literal constraint. Still vivid enough to charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</question><comment>Stated stake: expunge community pain through narrative. Yet escalation is atmospheric rather than causal—each photo deepens mood, not risk. One tightening pulse (last click) crystallizes the warden’s stance, but visible cost or option foreclosure remains off-screen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme—memory can be reshaped by curated witness—emerges implicitly via photographs and the label’s reprise. Closure image whispers this without moralizing. Fresh enough, though subtext could cut deeper with an embodied contradiction.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Lyric-cadenced voice sustains the mirrored hush; sensory selectivity shows bias—“morbid perfume,” “mirrored hush.” Consistent POV, no drift, though occasional poetic escalation edges toward self-admiration. Earns the grim lullaby tone.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Prose is rich yet disciplined; minor scaffold (“the warden’s thoughts turned…” appears twice) and slight tautology around “stillness” sap propulsion. Overall ear-pleasing rhythm and solid image density keep the line craft strong.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Flooded ghost town meets archive-ritual is a fresh synthesis with heedful details. Risk is immersive wallowing more than structural daring; nonetheless the approach feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</question>
