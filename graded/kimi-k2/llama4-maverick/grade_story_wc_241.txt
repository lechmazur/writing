<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her “theoretically rebellious” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page contradiction or micro-choice shows it constraining her tactics. The father remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is moot. The final resolve feels more declared than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing: Elara crystallizes a therapy plan whose cost is implied but not yet felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of subway rides and graffiti insights reweights the stake. One transition (library → subway → library) is within scope. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rain-soaked library and subway seats are vividly sketched, but only the candle lantern’s mica pane recurs to charge the final image. Micro-settings (desk, train seat) constrain attention rather than choice. Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Elara’s academic lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—helping father beat addiction—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental: each subway ride deepens insight, but no single beat narrows options or exacts visible cost. Pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing paradox emerges organically from graffiti and probability theory. Final image of lantern glow avoids moralizing, offering quiet resonance. Subtext is present but leans toward summary rather than gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, academic-lyric, with controlled psychic distance. No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated register (“clover melancholy”) fits Elara’s idiom. Rhythm breathes with scene shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with selective sensory detail and minimal loops. One paraphrase loop (“As she worked… As she packed”) is minor. Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors. Momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory, graffiti, and addiction therapy feels specific to Elara’s worldview. Subway-scrawl oracle is a novel device. Risk is moderate; no structural daring beyond lyric accumulation.</comment>
