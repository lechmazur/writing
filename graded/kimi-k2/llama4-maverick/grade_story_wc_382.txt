<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tutor’s interiority is warm but generic; student’s motivation surfaces only in one whispered line. No embodied contradiction or visible cost to either character at closure. Relationship functions as gentle conduit, not crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Charged Poise: handing over the seal crystallizes the transfer of curiosity, but the cost is abstract rather than felt. Causal chain is loose—meteor shower decorates rather than narrows options. Orientation is clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly sketched and supply atmosphere, yet neither constrains a choice nor charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stake—“understanding secrets of old buildings”—is declared late and never tested on the page. Pressure remains atmospheric; no tightening choice or forfeiture occurs. Escalation is poetic, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of “agreed-upon lies” lingers as tantalizing idea, re-emerging in the seal’s gift, but it is articulated more than dramatized. Subtext is gentle, resonance modest; avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, slightly archaic, consistent. Free of loops or register drift, but also lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose flows cleanly; occasional soft filler (“the tutor smiled, knowing…”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Density adequate for length; final image could be sharper.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh pairing of dead languages with architecture-as-language; yet execution stays safe, leaning on familiar mentor-student tenderness and meteor-lit wonder rather than risk.</comment>
