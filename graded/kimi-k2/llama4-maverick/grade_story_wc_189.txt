<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chronicler’s warmly observant stance is embodied but internal conflicts stay diffuse; the jade cicada motivates reflection yet no decisive action alters the stakes for the figures she watches. Final stance (rising with cicada at dawn) crystallizes Earned Stasis rather than forcing choice, showing cost but not driven by earlier motive chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accurately signals Accumulative/Textural lens; each still-moment stanza deepens texture of transition. Closure (Charged Poise as dawn light arrives) reconfigures meaning with felt stillness, but lacked earlier causal linkage between chronicler’s insight and direct consequence for the two figures—stakes remain largely observational rather than tested.</comment>

<comment>Starlit grotto anchoring via salt/seaweed drip and damp stone grounds body in place early. Details (shadows, jade cicada, faint hum) return in closing image and constrain chronicler’s seated stillness; spatial choreography between figures and chronicler remains coherent for word count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled early: chronicler’s desire to “foresee” the texture of time and the figures’ next move. Pressure accumulates through deepening stillness rather than narrowing options; felt cost arrives as the dawn forces end of vigil, but no on-page reversal tests commitment or tactics.</comment>

<comment>Transition/tempo-emergence theme arises organically from repeated stasis and cicada imagery. Closure reweights the pause itself, not a moral. Echoing “texture of time” risks leaning toward label-speak (-0.3) but offset by concrete sensory layering.</comment>

<comment>Poetic, rhythmic interior monologue is textured and consistent; chronicler’s perceptual signature favors subtle attention patterns (“damp stone floor”, “shadows danced”). No head-hopping, cadence breathes with scene mood; final sentence mirrors opening diction precisely.</comment>

<comment>Vivid sensory selection, no redundancy or overwritten passages. A single mild filter-verb sequence in middle paragraph triggers -0.15, but overall rhythm and clarity carry through closure. Final image of jade cicada against dawn light resonates cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Still-moment chronicle as central frame is fresh; transforms familiar meditation-on-time trope by placing it inside tidal pool vigil and anchoring it to a single night. Specific jade cicada recurs and shifts context without cliché.</comment>
