<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian’s obsession and promise are stated, but interior contradiction is thin; the “volcanic tenderness” is asserted rather than embodied. Micro-choices (charcoal strokes, leaving pieces) are present yet feel pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. No genuine flaw or misbelief complicates the rescue mission, so the final touch of the tapestry reads as symbolic duty, not earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the trail of art culminates in a hidden alcove message that reweights the promise and the vandalism. Causality is mostly accumulative; each art piece adds density until the final reconfiguration. The lens holds, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt—no irrevocable forfeiture is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The archive’s “aged parchment” air and fluorescent gloom are vivid and selective, anchoring early. The tapestry fragment returns to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene; however, the broader desert geography remains a postcard backdrop rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—signals early. Pressure escalates through the artistic trail, each piece narrowing options until the alcove reveal. Yet the tightening is more textural than causal; no tangible resource is lost or risk escalates beyond symbolic stakes, keeping the cost legible but mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as trans-temporal rescue emerges implicitly from Elian’s acts rather than statement. The tapestry’s smile reappears to reweight meaning at the end, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is present but occasionally nudged (“a testament to the power of art”), slightly diluting organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature is selective (dust motes, crimson slash) and voice modulates with intensity. No dialogue appears, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated phrasing (“singular obsession,” “volcanic tenderness”) drifts above Elian’s plausible lexicon under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings. A few loops (“trail of artistic creations…each piece a reflection…”) and near-paraphrase restatements dull propulsion. No mixed metaphors or major artifacts, but density could be higher; some scaffolding sentences could be excised without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The lending-library arsonist who becomes desert archivist-artist is a fresh synthesis; tropes of archive rescue and vandalized portrait are transformed through Elian’s outsider artistry. Specific details (charcoal, found objects) ground the concept. The final image of the tapestry as enduring witness feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
