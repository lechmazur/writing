<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eira’s interiority is vivid—her fear of creative atrophy is embodied in the “stagnant creativity” she feels—but the story never dramatizes a contradictory impulse; her arc is linear acceptance rather than struggle. The final “renewed sense of purpose” is asserted rather than earned through a visible renunciation or cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained: each paragraph layers sensory density until the keystone’s glow reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden’s light crystallizes Eira’s stance—but the cost is only implied (“memory of the keystone’s gentle glow”), not felt on the page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spire’s “icebound” corridors and “twisted, ethereal design” are tactile and constraining; the garden’s star-like flowers and glowing keystone anchor the final image. Selective sensory detail (crisp air, soft light) filters through Eira’s wonder. However, the spire’s physics-defying trait never limits her choices, keeping it below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creative rebirth—is signaled early and intensifies as Eira approaches the keystone. The unstrapping beat is the single tightening, but it resolves too easily; no visible price is paid. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but lacks a felt cost that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred resides in simple, endangered imagination. The keystone’s glow reweights the premise without moralizing. Yet the insight—“the sacred was not something grand”—is articulated rather than dramatized, slightly blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; phrases like “chorus of the forgotten” and “brilliant dimness” modulate tone. POV remains tightly focalized through Eira’s awe. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable connection”) edges toward register drift but stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. No loops or scaffold. A few stacked modifiers (“intricate carvings that told the story…”) slightly dilute peak beats, but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of automated creativity anxiety with a mythic ice-spire quest feels fresh. Tropes (hidden garden, glowing keystone) are transformed through Eira’s understated longing. The final “brilliant dimness” offers a non-obvious synthesis of light and loss.</comment>
