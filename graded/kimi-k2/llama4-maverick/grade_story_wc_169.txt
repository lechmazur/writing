<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is consistent—“logical dreamer” and “lucidly watchful” recur—but her choices remain observational; no contradictory impulse or visible cost alters her stance. The final smile feels unearned because the vision changes nothing she risks or forfeits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vision reweights the gauge and patterns, but the cost is only asserted (“she knew”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the deepening pattern suffices, yet the lack of felt price keeps it shy of 7.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s tide-polished surfaces and drifting light constrain Aria’s slow, seated ritual; the gauge’s soft blue pulse becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail supports the serene upheaval tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes—“equations for hope” across timelines—stay abstract; no tightening choice or trade-off appears on the page. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, so escalation remains mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of hope as pattern-making emerges through image rather than statement, but the closing smile edges toward mild assertion. Subtext is present yet not piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; diction is calm, rhythmic, and filtered through Aria’s contemplative bias. No head-hop or register drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but occasional soft filler (“gently lapping waves created a soothing melody”) and stacked modifiers slightly dilute density. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The hope-as-pattern conceit is fresh, yet the trial-balloon motif stays thematic rather than tactical. Risk is modest; the piece feels like a well-wrought meditation rather than a daring synthesis.</comment>
