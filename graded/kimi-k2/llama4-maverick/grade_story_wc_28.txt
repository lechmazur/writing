<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“warm coldness”); her contradictory impulse—mercy amid ruin—drives the renaming beat. Yet the retrocognitive flashback is summary, not scene, so the cost of memory feels told rather than dramatized, blunting the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza is renamed, reweighting its meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens toward the final vibration. Cost is legible in the “shattered sky” that remains, but the renaming act itself is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plaza’s charred stalls and chipped mosaic constrain Aria’s path and supply the vision-trigger. The tessera’s glint and the “shattered sky” are selective, tactile details that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the plaza through mercy—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the vision forces the renaming. The cost is conceptual (accepting perpetual brokenness) but less viscerally felt than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from Aria’s act and the ruined setting. The final image reweights the plaza without moralizing. One near-theme line (“beacon of warmth in a world…”) edges toward statement but is saved by its placement mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“gentle radical,” “warm coldness”). POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) is consistent with Aria’s reflective stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops. One mixed metaphor (“embers from a dying fire” beside “shattered sky”) is minor. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic ruin with mosaic memory feels fresh; the renaming ritual is a non-obvious response. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric compression rather than structural experiment—but coherent.</comment>
