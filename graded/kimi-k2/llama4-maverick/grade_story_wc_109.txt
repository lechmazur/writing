<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; her “mild obsession” never translates into a visible trade-off or micro-choice. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, and the final smile feels unearned because the cost of mapping the night is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world “rearranged into a new and mysterious pattern”), but the causal chain is weak: the act of “summarizing the silence” is never grounded in rules or stakes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence deepens, yet the felt cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm, and candlelight are vividly evoked and filter through the oracle’s perception. The darkness-as-texture in the climax constrains visibility and thus the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“to draw a map of the endless night”—is declared early but never tested or tightened; no option is foreclosed on the page. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal, so escalation is present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative-as-cartography emerges organically from the oracle’s task and the silence motif. The final image reframes prior material without moralizing, though the conceptual cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorily attuned; syntactic rhythm modulates with the storm’s ebb. The perceptual signature is distinct, though occasional elevated diction edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic, mostly propulsive, but suffers from repetitive phrasing (“ambered hush,” “flaking gold leaf booklet”) and stacked metaphors that blur clarity in peak beats. No loops touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fusion of cartography, silence, and oracle ritual feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy tropes. The risk of an almost plotless lyric piece is managed by coherent atmospheric escalation.</comment>
