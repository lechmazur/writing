<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—eyes “unsettling pale blue,” hair “consciously wild”—but the final epiphany is delivered as summary rather than embodied choice, muting the cost. The drone and ink patterns are observed, not wielded, so agency feels external. Still, the albino tracker’s sensory focus and quiet fury remain coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single-scene arc holds: eclipse ends → ink trace → ridge encounter → shared gaze. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the moment of “shared understanding” reweights the mystery of time dilation without solving it, leaving a felt cost in Kael’s simmering anger. Orientation is anchored early; causality is thin but intact under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved ridges, fading light, and the drone’s iridescence are selective and POV-filtered. The disappearing-ink smudge on rock is tactile and plot-relevant. Spatial choreography is clean; the precipice edge is a concrete constraint. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover why time slows—drives pursuit. Pressure tightens when ink patterns fade, forcing Kael to crest the ridge. The final shared gaze narrows options: knowledge gained, but no action taken, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s elasticity emerges through the eclipse residue and the shared moment of dilation, never stated outright. Subtext lies in Kael’s “serene anger” and the missing person’s calm—two stances toward the same mystery. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s sensory intake; no head-hopping. Prose is textured—“iridescent feathers glimmering,” “tangled mess of white locks”—yet avoids purple drift. Rhythm modulates with Kael’s pulse: short clauses under tension, longer cadences in stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, propulsive, and image-rich. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral patterns,” “conceptual contemplation”) edges toward register drift but remains within Kael’s heightened perception. Minor filter verbs (“seemed to be made”) are rare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of near-future drone and vanishing-ink espionage with a lyric meditation on time perception feels fresh. The eclipse as temporal hinge is understated; the hummingbird drone is more than gadget, becoming witness. Risk is quiet—no twist, yet the speculative element reframes human experience.</comment>
