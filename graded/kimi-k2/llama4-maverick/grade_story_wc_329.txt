<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Luna’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is stated early and drives her playing, but interiority stays generic; the statues’ gratitude is told rather than embodied, and no contradictory impulse complicates her arc. The locust shell is clutched but never used to alter a decision, so its symbolic weight feels ornamental. The final choice—to leave and continue her quest—is logical yet cost-free on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers sensory music until the orchard “vibrates with renewed vitality,” a clear cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statues walk free and the sky-bridge glows, reweighting the premise. However, the cost to Luna herself is only implied, not dramatized, slightly thinning the earned change.</comment>

<comment>The enchanted orchard is sketched with shimmering flowers and living statues that crack under music, grounding the scene. Spatial choreography is coherent: statues uproot and approach Luna in sequence. Yet the orchard never constrains her tactics; it merely provides a beautiful stage, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—free the statues and revive beauty—escalates as Luna’s melody “softens their rigid forms,” a clear tightening under Accumulative pressure. Agency is hers, but the price she pays is off-stage; the statues bear the visible transformation. One meaningful intensification occurs, sufficient for the length.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: music as antidote to mechanization. The final image of the glowing sky-bridge offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, a late echo—“the world… still held a deep well of wonder”—leans toward explicit statement, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Luna’s gentle perception: “music drifted… like a gentle breeze.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No POV leakage; the statues’ wonder is shown externally. Occasional soft filler (“sweet scent of blossoming dreams”) keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose flows with rhythmic variation and vivid sensory nouns. Minor loops (“the orchard… the orchard”) and stacked modifiers (“resonantly soft touch… shimmered like stardust”) appear but do not stall momentum. Clean grammar and coherent spatial tracking.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of sky-bridge violinist, living statues, and locust shell feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy templates. The transformation of sentinels through music is an inventive reversal. Risk is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric premise without gimmickry.</comment>
