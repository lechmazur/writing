<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The colorblind painter’s interiority is sketched through his “innocently cunning” manipulation of others’ suggestions, but the trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. His motivation to “find beauty in imperfection” is consistent yet static, lacking a visible cost or micro-choice that alters his stance. The glassblower remains a functional mirror rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard becomes “a place where people came to see the world anew,” reweighting the premise of imperfection. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned deepening rather than causal linkage—and it holds. However, the decisive change is narrated rather than dramatized; the cost is communal, not personal, blunting the sting needed for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glassblower’s courtyard is evoked with selective sensory detail—soft clinking furnaces, molten glass, drifting petals—filtered through the painter’s biased perception. Spatial choreography is coherent; the concertina reed tongue’s placement feels purposeful. Yet the environment never physically constrains a choice; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or tool, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening others to imperfection’s beauty—is signaled early but escalates only through gentle accumulation of admirers, not a tightening choice. The painter’s agency is observational; he arranges plants and watches reactions rather than risking loss or renunciation. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, satisfying the lens but lacking a visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>“Bartered awakenings” emerges organically from the painter’s wordless plant arrangements and the glassblower’s shift toward intentional flaws. Subtext is carried in gesture and image, not exposition. The final tableau of the reed tongue “whispering a gentle melody” offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the conceptual cost remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The prose has a consistent lyric texture—measured cadence, painterly diction—but occasional template repetition (“the painter… the glassblower… the courtyard”) flattens rhythm. POV stays third-limited to the painter without leakage. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction relies on perceptual signature, which is adequate but not singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are clean and propulsive, with only minor paraphrase loops (“the painter… continued to awaken… continued to work”). Figurative language is restrained; no mixed metaphors intrude. Density is moderate—some beats could compress further—but clarity is never compromised.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of colorblind painter, glassblower, and “bartered awakenings” feels fresh, avoiding familiar templates. The reed tongue’s transformation from detritus to silent chorus is an inventive pivot. Risk is modest—no structural daring—but specificity of vision and thematic coherence elevate the piece above derivative territory.</comment>
