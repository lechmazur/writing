<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“preemptively nostalgic,” “sculpt her identity”). No contradictory impulses in scene; the final acceptance feels foregone rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of memory immersion tightens via crystal contact. Closure is a Charged Poise (“guardian of the collective memory”) with conceptual cost, yet the causality between conjecture and crystallized stance is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered; rain-refracted lightning and wet stone anchor mood. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice—the crystal could be any luminous relic—so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving/shaping identity via collective memory—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through immersion, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory as identity emerges organically from imagery and ritual. Final image reweights earlier nostalgia without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans on lyrical assertion rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and atmospheric; perceptual signature favors synesthetic weather imagery. Occasional elevated diction (“mundane and sublime”) momentarily lifts out of POV lexicon but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “stood there” repeated in closing beats; no loops obscure closure. Density is high, yet some sentences lean on abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Memory-archive-as-ritual is a familiar conceit, but the stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt give it fresh sensory specificity. No radical risk, yet the synthesis feels coherent and non-generic.</comment>
