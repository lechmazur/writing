<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied (“bare feet slap cold metal”) and motive (rekindle lost purpose) is consistent, but the decisive shift from despair to resolve is compressed into a single mystical beat rather than earned through visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum crystallizes her stance and reweights the future. Causal linkage is thin—legendary stone circle solves inner crisis rather than arising from prior tactics—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the cost (accepting the rebellion’s continuation) is felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Repair bay’s rust and grime, the mountain’s moss-covered stones, and the vibrating opera glasses all constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her gaze; the setting evolves from defeat to promise without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost conviction—tightens once when the hum forces a stance crystallization. Escalation is tonal (thunderous serenity) rather than causal; cost is conceptual (she must return to fight) and legible, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering purpose amid ruin emerges through the opera glasses’ reframing of stars and rust. Final image reweights earlier defeat without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the rebellion can succeed, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with rhythmic control that modulates from desolate stillness to charged anticipation. Perceptual signature is strong: “awkwardly confident” gait, barefoot cold, vintage lenses vibrating—details that could only belong to her.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, though occasional lyrical stacking (“thunderous serenity,” “celestial map”) edges toward overwriting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or interior motion. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar rebellion-aftermath frame is refreshed by the barefoot stargazer, opera-glass lens, and humming stone circle—specific, grounded choices that transform the trope. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
