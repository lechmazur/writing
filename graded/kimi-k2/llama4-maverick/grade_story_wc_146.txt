<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tuner’s patience is stated repeatedly but never tested; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice reveals cost. Interiority remains generic (“infinitely patient gaze”) rather than embodied. The final stance is a continuation, not a renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—the town’s “sound of a town reborn” reconfigures meaning—but the cost is only implied, not legible on the page. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds yet lacks a felt forfeiture at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Deserted cobblestones, ancient archway, and twilight are vivid and selective. The ebony tuning fork functions as micro-setting that constrains the tuner’s method. Sensory detail is filtered through the tuner’s rhythmic focus, though spatial choreography stays static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via rhythmic density, but the escalation is observational; no decisive choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. Agency remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through patient vibration emerges implicitly. The final image reweights the premise, yet the conceptual cost is muted. Subtext is present in the “wild hush,” but no moral friction complicates the tuner’s stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with rhythmic prose mirroring the tuner’s metronomic steps. Diction stays controlled; no POV leakage. Compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative design and remain legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; sentences advance atmosphere or rhythm without loops. Occasional near-repetition (“the rhythm grew stronger, more insistent”) is mild. Figurative language is coherent and supports the textural lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of reviving a ghost town through footstep resonance is fresh. Specificity lies in the tuner’s method rather than character depth. Risk is moderate; execution is coherent but not transformative enough to feel inevitable.</comment>
