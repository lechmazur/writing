<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Akira’s gently-persistent resolve is established early and displayed through sustained micro-decisions (midnight runs, bell ringing as ritual), but interior contradiction is minimal and the change remains incremental rather than sharply transformative, capping the score below the 7.1 threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Causality holds—the bell and donations drive every beat—but closure is soft: the final chime restates solidarity rather than reconfiguring it, so lens (Accumulative) lands without a clear after-state.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Language is clean and rhythmic, but several near-synonym phrases ("glow," "warm orange," "soft light") and a pattern of "gently…" stems create mild scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Quiet communal resilience as angle is fresh, yet several stock phrases (“not be broken by the actions of others”) hover close to familiar protest lexicon and offer limited inversion.</comment>
