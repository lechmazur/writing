<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s quiet drive is stated repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice that costs her anything; the whistle-touch is gestural. Interiority drifts into summary (“she felt a sense of dread”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. No earned change or renunciation—she simply walks toward the watchers. Competence is asserted without visible struggle or flaw complicating tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a situational Charged Poise: Lyra steps beyond the city, watchers looming, cost implied but not yet felt on the page. Causal chain is loose—pattern reading triggers crack, reveals map, but no therefore linkage between map and the decision to leave; motivation is asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. Lens holds as situational pressure crystallizing stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>City-on-turtles is vividly sketched early and the cracked shell functions as micro-setting that enables the map reveal. Sensory detail is selective (sunwashed streets, shell patterns) but occasionally generic (“the air was thick with tension”). Setting guides choice only at the shell crack; otherwise backdrop. Meets 9+ gate partially—shell constrains one beat but does not charge final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover fate of expedition—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once via map reveal, but escalation is informational rather than option-narrowing; no visible cost paid by Lyra yet. Agency is present but abstract—she “sets out” rather than choosing under duress. Coincidence (crack reveals map) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of heedless inquiry versus silent surveillance emerges implicitly through Lyra’s defiant step. Subtext is strongest in the watchers’ silence and her unanswered whistle. Avoids overt moralizing, but insight remains general—no specific particular reweights the premise at closure. Resonance is moderate; dread lingers but lacks conceptual sting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Lyra’s cartographer eye (“spiral-shell cartographer,” “shell-scarred landmark”). Rhythm modulates with tension, though occasional template cadence (“As she walked…”) flattens peaks. No dialogue to test distinction. POV modesty maintained; no head-hop. Reed whistle motif returns but without tonal shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, with selective sensory detail. Minor loops (“she felt the weight… she felt the weight”) and stock phrases (“sent a chill down her spine”) dull intensity. No mixed metaphors. Density adequate—sentences advance scene or mood. Final third avoids artifacts. Lacks the compression and propulsion demanded at 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>City on slow-moving turtles is fresh; pairing with pattern-language cartography deepens the frame. Watchers as silent, distant overseers invert typical guardian trope. Premise is specific enough to resist swap test. Risk is moderate—conceptual rather than structural daring. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable yet not fully exploited by closure.</comment>
