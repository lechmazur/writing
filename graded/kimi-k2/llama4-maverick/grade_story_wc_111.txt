<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dresser’s devotion and the marbles-as-memory device are evocative, but interiority stays summary-level; no moment shows contradictory impulses under pressure. The “gardens know their gardeners” belief is asserted, never dramatized in a choice that costs the dresser something tangible. No relationship crucible or secondary pressure tests the stance, so the arc feels observational rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the dresser smiles at the garden’s “knowledge,” a resonant reconfiguration. Yet the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the single tightening (garden’s measurable luck) is introduced late; earlier beats lack causal linkage. Orientation is clear, but the pattern of escalating care is more stated than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The garden maze is vividly sketched—towering hedges, bittersweet scent—yet it functions mostly as backdrop. Only in the final image does the setting constrain the dresser’s exit into shadow, giving the maze a minor charge. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, but the environment never actively limits choices or tools.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens reciprocate care) is signaled early, but pressure remains diffuse: no on-page test forces the dresser to risk or forfeit anything. The “measurable luck” concept complicates without tightening options. A single beat of visible cost is missing; the victory feels pre-assured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal nurture emerges through imagery rather than declaration. The marbles’ shift from loss to testament is a subtle reweighting. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo (“a truth that was both simple and profound”) in the closing lines, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with restrained diction and rhythmic control. Compression (“withering beauty”) is purposeful. No dialogue or POV drift; perceptual signature is modest but coherent. A few stock phrases (“devotion that bordered on reverence”) slightly flatten texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; occasional elevated phrasing (“testament to the power of nurturing”) borders on template cadence. Information density is moderate—some sentences restate prior emotional beats. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of quantified luck with intimate gardening is fresh, yet the emotional arc follows familiar caretaker tropes. Specificity of the cracked marbles helps, but the overall pattern feels recognizable. A quiet risk in the subdued ending keeps it from cliché.</comment>
