<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Emilia’s curiosity is vivid and embodied, but her interiority stays at summary level; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final resolve is stated rather than earned by a visible micro-choice that costs her something now.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mood thickens, image of glowing mushroom recurs, final stance crystallizes. Yet closure is a declared intention (“ready to see it through”) without on-page Decisive Change or felt cost; it remains prospective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sunken orchard and shipwrecks are richly sensed and filtered through Emilia’s gaze; the greenhouse constrains movement and the glowing mushroom charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting does not force a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure intensifies atmospherically but never narrows options or exacts a visible price on the page; the tension remains prospective rather than operative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and pattern-detection emerges organically from imagery and action. Final image of glowing mushroom reweights earlier material, but the insight is still somewhat abstract; ambiguity is present yet not fully charged with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with lyrical compression that suits the folkloric mood. Sensory diction is specific; however, occasional elevated phrasing (“crisp nostalgia,” “doors of perception”) edges toward poetic template.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. A few near-repetitive stems (“she felt,” “she knew”) and mild filter verbs slightly dull immediacy, but no artifact obstructs clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing drowned orchard, fairy-ring myth, and memory theft yields a fresh angle on the folkloric quest. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though the execution leans on familiar lyric cadences rather than radical form.</comment>
