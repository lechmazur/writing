<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“quietly determined spirit” felt in deliberate hammering), but the apprentice’s arrival is too late to test the blacksmith’s status or values; the final “passing on” moment is asserted rather than dramatized, so the earned cost is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (orchard scent, pickaxe echoes, silk shimmer) thickens until the sword’s shimmer crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the apprentice’s wonder reconfigures the smith’s solitude into mentorship—yet the cost (loss of isolation) is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches and abandoned shafts are sketched with selective, POV-filtered detail; the forge’s micro-setting (glowing metal, sweet orchard air) constrains attention and mood. However, the shafts remain off-stage, so the environment never directly limits the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled early and escalates through each hammer blow; the silk’s success tightens the smith’s resolve into azure defiance. Cost is present (hours of solitary labor) but generalized; no single irreversible trade-off is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation through barter and labor emerges organically from the smith’s tactile choices; the magician’s silk reweights from exotic curiosity to catalytic tool. Final image avoids moralizing, yet the apprentice’s arrival feels slightly convenient rather than thematically inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, rhythmic, and sensorily precise; free-indirect texture (“the silence of the mines was a balm”) stays consistent. Compression is purposeful, though occasional elevated phrasing (“azure defiance”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, with varied sentence lengths that echo hammer strikes. Minor loops (“the air was filled with the sweet scent… again”) and one mixed metaphor (“phoenix from the ashes” beside orchard breeze) keep it from flawless polish.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “humble artisan + magic material” frame is refreshed by the orchard planet’s floating geology and the silk’s living shimmer. The apprentice coda risks cliché, but the smith’s understated POV and sensory specificity lend freshness.</comment>
