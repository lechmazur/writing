<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tutor’s guilt is embodied in the red-rimmed eyes and tactile unraveling of tapestry threads, but the interior contradiction—why decoding a weave absolves him—remains asserted rather than dramatized. The final “weight lifting” is more label than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth exit crystallizes a new stance of self-forgiveness with visible cost—the village’s thaw confirms the change. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal, but the lens holds cleanly to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen village’s “wet earth and ozone” is filtered through the tutor’s exhausted attention; the tapestry border and labyrinth portal function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens once when the decoded labyrinth forces confrontation. The cost is felt in the final thaw, but the middle lacks a visible forfeiture that alters tactics; pressure is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Forgiveness as emergent theme threads through tapestry, labyrinth, and thaw without moralizing. The final image of birdsong replacing hush offers a non-literal, earned reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a hushed, slightly archaic cadence that mirrors the tutor’s obsessive focus. No dialogue appears; the narrative voice remains consistent and textured, with perceptual signature in “fierce intensity” and “woven hush.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; only minor loop (“the tutor… the tutor…”) and a few stacked modifiers (“expectant hush that wrapped…”) slightly dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Chess-tutor exile + time-frozen village + tapestry labyrinth synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh emotional crucible. The risk of lyric stasis is offset by the earned thaw; specificity prevents generic allegory.</comment>
