<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her motivation to “merge parallel timelines” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, and the final step into the unknown feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara steps into the unknown with cost implied by the “permanent transient-ness.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density rises, but the vanishing-ferry mystery is never tested on-page, so the tightening is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is evoked with starlight, hum, and etched symbols; these details constrain Elara’s attention and guide her decoding, but they do not directly limit her final choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the truth of the vanishing ferry—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via pattern discovery, yet the cost remains conceptual; no concrete option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries and cosmic balance emerges through imagery and pattern rather than statement. The final image reweights the premise, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps resonance moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; occasional elevated diction (“spectral beauty,” “cosmic balance”) edges toward poetic overlay but stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory, but repeated abstract phrasing (“spectral beauty,” “fabric of reality”) and stacked metaphors create minor density drag; no line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sideways-clock equinox and vanishing-ferry lore offer a fresh angle on liminal-time tales; synthesis feels organic, though the mystery remains more atmospheric than novel.</comment>
