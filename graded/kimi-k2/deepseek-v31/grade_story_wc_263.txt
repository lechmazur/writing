<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning is vivid and embodied, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the single on-page choice (assembling the nocturlabe) is well-motivated yet the cost is diffuse—exhaustion rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the world blooms and her mind unlocks, cost felt in “shadowed rapture.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor drift is the off-stage journey compressed into lyric summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Monochrome city, frozen plain, and auroral arch are rendered with selective sensory detail; the nocturlabe itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is coherent; only the city’s social texture remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing creativity—escalates via aurora’s appearance and meteor navigation; one tightening beat aligns the device. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, keeping it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of repressed imagination emerges organically through setting and action; final image of color erupting from light-rain reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the nocturlabe’s “silent song” is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in synesthetic hearing of “unspoken words.” Rhythm modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“bone cage,” “shadowed rapture”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; minor loops (“color erupted… flowers of impossible hues”) and stacked modifiers (“ethereal and impossible”) slightly dull peak intensity. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by cosmic instrument and synesthetic gift; transformation of monochrome world via auroral gate feels inevitable. Specificity of meteor-path navigation adds fresh inflection.</comment>
