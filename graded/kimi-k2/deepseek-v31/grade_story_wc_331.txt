<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile ritual (scarf, mosaic steps), but interior contradiction is muted; the “sanely eccentric” label never complicates her flawless execution, so the final smile feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ozone, hand-press, silence) thickens until the air itself reconfigures. Closure is a Charged Poise—nascent narratives shimmer with undeniable conceptual cost—yet the cost to Elara herself remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library’s hyperbolic mosaic breathes beneath her feet, constraining every step; the scarf’s “sigh” texture and ozone scent anchor the scene in specific, POV-filtered detail that charges the final image without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single stake—locate pre-narrative space—tightens via escalating sensory density; the shift from browsing murmur to hushed shimmer narrows options. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping pressure legible but not viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of geometry and memory: stories warp space like mass warps spacetime. The final image reframes the entire library as living substrate, avoiding explicit moral while inviting recursive reflection on narrative origin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and mathematically inflected (“hyperbolic geometry,” “narrative singularity”) yet remains intimate; perceptual signature is consistent, with no POV drift or explanatory clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each clause layers sensory or conceptual weight. A few near-cadence repetitions (“she began to walk… she began to…”) are minor artifacts that do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific poetry library, hyperbolic ritual, and analog memory feels inevitable and fresh; the concept commits fully without hedging, transforming familiar tropes into a singular, risk-taking vision.</comment>
