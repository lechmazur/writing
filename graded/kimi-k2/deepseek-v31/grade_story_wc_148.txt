<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“his own inherited sin was silence”); micro-choice with lattice as shield crystallizes stance; lies-as-survival rooted in multi-generational flaw; cost is visible quiet he must now live within; meets single-POV scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens taught early; intensifying hum, spectral coalescence tighten pressure; closure is Earned Stasis—“he had found his hush”—with conceptual cost that bodies remain undiscovered and silence must be endured forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Copperlight repose” and “brutal stone” anchor micro-setting; lighthouse prison constrains access and frames isolation; lattice evolves from background detail to literal filter, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is keeping final truth quiet before external discovery; single meaningful tightening occurs when spectral guardian dissolves after exacting confession; on-page cost is that eternal silence replaces lies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited fear and silence emerges organically through image of generational “sin”; final image of peaceful silence is non-thematic statement yet undeniably weighted with horror and relief mixed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vocabulary is precise, cadence modulates (“a copperlight repose”, “profound quiet”); POV sensorium remains intimate; purposeful echo of metaphors (“lies were born from necessity” / “fear that sustains impossibilities”) ties voice to lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, vivid; every sentence advances stakes or texture; no loops or filter-verb clutter; metaphors (“swirling concentration of every desperate plea”) are purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Inheriting silence instead of wolf-crying is fresh inversion; lighthouse-prison-as-confessional fuses Gothic atmosphere with familial curse; silence as artifact and weapon feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
