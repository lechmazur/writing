<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s exile motive and obsession with salvaged knowledge are clear; the brass cog triggers a visible shift from detached calm to urgent descent. Interiority is textured (“abrasive calm,” “quiet defiance”) and embodied. The final resolve to “restart the clock of history” is earned by the evidence he literally holds, with the cost of abandoning his former isolation legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is causal: cog discovery → dive → shattered chronometer → revised history. Closure is a Decisive Change: Elias pivots from preservation to active truth-telling, cost being the rupture of his “abrasive calm.” Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis (surface-to-dive) is acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The drowned city is rendered in precise, sense-driven strokes—“labyrinth of stone canals,” “green light filtering through water”—that guide Elias’s vertical archaeology. The chronometer’s scar and the statue’s plinth anchor space and time. Environment constrains choice: only the diving bell grants access, and the ruined timepiece physically blocks the plinth crack, forcing recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve vs. correct history. Pressure tightens when the cog contradicts the sanctioned narrative; the dive is the single, irreversible escalation. Cost is the loss of Elias’s protective exile. Agency is high: every move is his decision under mounting evidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—how regimes falsify catastrophe to control memory—emerges through the competing chronometer narratives. The final image of the “shattered time” cog reframes the plague as epilogue, not climax. Subtext is carried by the ruined statue’s blind stare and the silent brass teeth. No moralizing; resonance is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is erudite yet tactile, matching a philosopher who tastes silt and names epistemologies. Syntax lengthens under watery pressure, then tightens at the discovery: “a piece of a machine that was shattered in its prime.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elias’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective (“abrasive calm,” “furious peace”). One paraphrase loop—“slow sinking…slow abandonment”—is minor. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—post-apocalyptic scholar, sunken city—are refreshed by the vertical archaeology conceit and the chronometer’s forensic rebuttal. The synthesis of plague-as-aftershock feels inevitable once revealed. Risk lies in the compressed dive sequence; it pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
