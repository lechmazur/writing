<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s compulsion to find “the library of unspoken words” is dramatized through her decision to lift the veil and claim guardianship; interiority remains specific and tied to every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure—her father knew, the library is internal—lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; causality (watch → cipher → corridor) holds under the Causal lens without missteps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The glowing, mist-shrouded library is sketched with selective sensorial detail and supplies both resources (the watch’s resonance) and pressure (immense silence), constraining every action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—finding the library—tightens when the archway demands a documented process; propagation-delay mechanics force a live trade-off between fear and truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of self-generated meaning emerges solely from specific choices (veil lifted, record begun) rather than assertion; the silent archway offers resonant, non-literal payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrid prose keeps its perceptual signature under pressure (silence felt as “weight pressing against her soul”); compression around the final cipher beat is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Density is high with no looping; “cyclically reversed” cipher and “propagation delays” are handled lucidly, while rhythmic variety carries the silent corridor without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—a library that is both external and internal—feels inevitable, and the unconventional reliance on cryptographic silence heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
