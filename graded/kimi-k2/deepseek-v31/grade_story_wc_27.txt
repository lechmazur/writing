<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot stargazer identity is embodied through tactile detail and micro-choices; the “awkwardly confident” trait manifests in her hesitant step yet absolute purpose. Interiority is specific and embodied, culminating in the final conduit moment. The cost—her body as lightning rod—lands as felt consequence. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dormant node ignites, reconfiguring the sky and the rebellion’s horizon. Causal chain—lull → discovery → ignition—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is visible in the silver pillar and the bodily strain. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s cold permacrete, skeletal roof, and ozone scent constrain movement and echo the stalled rebellion. The stone circle functions as micro-setting that literally powers the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; every detail is filtered through Elara’s barefoot perception. One hairline slip: “thunderous serenity” leans toward label.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindling hope via ancient power—tightens once when Elara steps into the circle. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification under Accumulative lens: the hum rises, light erupts, options reconfigure. Cost is the bodily conduit risk. No reversals needed; one meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between past connection and present blasters; meaning is discovered and then given back. Final image of new constellations offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence before lightning. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s barefoot, grease-stained perception. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at ignition. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Distinct perceptual signature: “soles whispering,” “ozone scent,” “humming up her spine.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor elevated diction (“primordial sky”) is earned by voice. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: opera glasses aimed at the ground, rebellion reignited by stone-age tech. Specificity of barefoot stargazer in derelict spaceport feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in final constellation. No derivative echoes.</comment>
