<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her tactile film-threading and spatial imagination drive every beat. The projectionist’s archived love is rendered through her perceptual lens, not exposition. A clear renunciation—she chooses projection over possession—costs her the private keepsake and completes her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stored love is released into the auditorium, reweighting the premise. Causal chain holds—psychometry → incubation → projection—each step narrowing options. Cost is legible: the love is no longer hers alone to hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The booth’s dust, hot metal, and celluloid scent anchor POV bias; the attic dormer window materializes as a memory pocket that constrains her next move. Final image—the screen as beating heart—charges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—tightens when Elara realizes archiving is not loss but withholding. One decisive turn: she loads the reel, releasing the love at the cost of private possession. Pressure grows under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of storage into circulation; the final image reframes “unused love” as communal heartbeat. Subtext operates in the unmailed letters and the unspoken choice to share rather than keep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and spatially oriented; phrases like “vast, navigable landscapes” and “humming discordantly” reflect Elara’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; POV distance stays locked to her sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“a symphony of abandoned joy and sorrow”—yet never overwrought. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Final line earns its lift without purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of love archived in celluloid feels inevitable in hindsight; the projectionist’s unsent letters reframe the festival’s urgency. Fresh synthesis of psychometry and cinematic memory, executed with emotional specificity.</comment>
