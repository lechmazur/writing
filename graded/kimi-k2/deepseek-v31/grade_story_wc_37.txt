<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, bone-deep collapse) and her knitting trait is dramatized through the swaddling ritual. Motivation is clear, but the internal contradiction—fear of loss vs. hope of recall—remains stated rather than acted out in a single micro-choice. The final communal singing is earned, yet the cost to Elara personally is diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new woven dawn glows in the mica window, reconfiguring the realm’s fate with communal cost felt in their joined voices. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fading light → recovered song → rekindled dawn. One smooth shard with no orientation debt; causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse, starless void, silver-bough trees, and mica window are vivid and selective. The mica window constrains the final choice—singing into it—and the swaddled fruits become literal threads in the closing tapestry. Spatial anchors are immediate; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—realm’s extinction—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is the gradual reassembly of song; each recovered note tightens the communal bond and brightens the ghost-sun. Cost is collective exhaustion and the risk of remembering wrongly, visible in tentative voices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory as creative force emerges from the orchard’s dying light and the act of re-weaving. Subtext lives in the mica shards: fragments of past brilliance that must be re-sung rather than merely mourned. Final image reframes the “bound release” without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression (“pearlescent glow,” “fractured recollections”). POV stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short clauses at climax. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“tentatively joined in”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“lattice upon which this world had been built”) skirts purple but serves the mythic register. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“threads of light…into a new tapestry”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines memory-keeper trope with alchemical orchard and song-weaving cosmology in a fresh synthesis. The mirror-world stasis and mica-window past-gaze avoid cliché. Risky lyric mode pays off: the communal re-weaving feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
