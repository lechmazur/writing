<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s exile-guilt and “beauty in the difficult” creed drive every micro-choice; the stone’s dent embodies anxious obsession, his counter-hum is a tactical risk, and the final weary awareness costs him solitude. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The cartographer is sketched only as needed, so relationship crucible is thin—keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: broken covenant → exile → nightly ritual → correlate silence → counter-frequency → map tapped → fracture sealed. Each beat narrows options; the stone’s return records visible cost. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt price: Kael forfeits isolation to re-enter the living game. Orientation, transitions, lens all clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nexus hum, metal filings in coat seams, and counter-frequency make the setting a participatory instrument that alters tactics. Basalt stone serves as micro-setting whose dent and weight anchor POV bias. Selective sensory triage mirrors Kael’s strategic mind. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the elegant move that heals”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael risks his only talisman on a stranger. The tapping coordinate burst is a clear reversal that forecloses the option to walk away. Cost is legible: the stable chord locks him back into human entanglement. One meaningful escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: silence as unreadable board-position, beauty as the move that restores voice. Final image reweights the stone from anxiety token to victory marker without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—he gains purpose yet loses protective exile. Subtext in finger-taps avoids thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s strategic perceptual filter; syntax is spare, rhythmic, chess-adjacent. Counter-hum and dented stone carry idiosyncratic signature. No dialogue clutter; girl’s single whisper suits pilgrim stance. Voice modulates under pressure—short pulses mirror magnetic beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances board-state or sensory charge. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“metal filings in old coat seams” does double duty. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density with clean grammar and varied rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-star-chart is a fresh inversion of psychic-break tropes; exiled strategist turned healer-of-quiet feels non-obvious. Nexus as tuning fork for minds synthesizes hard-SF and lyric interiority. Could swap names yet tactical specificity keeps it particular. Risk in minimal cast pays off.</comment>
