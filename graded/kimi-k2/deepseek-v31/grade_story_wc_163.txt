<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—charting unreachable stars while craving belonging—is embodied in micro-choices (bypassing sensors, activating beacon). The burnt feather reprise crystallizes her shift from sky to sea with visible cost: she forfeits the last relic of surface life to broadcast the deep’s rhythm. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of bioluminescent pattern reweights the stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: final image of transmitting the polyp dance reconfigures her purpose and forecloses return to sky-astrology. Cost is the irreversible severance signaled by the feather’s re-interpretation. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartzglass viewport, groaning joints, and drifting fish create claustrophobic specificity; the burnt feather later functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors pressure and phosphorescence, mirroring internal stakes. Environment actively guides her pivot from sky charts to water rhythms. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when failing instruments force a creative gamble; the polyp revelation escalates by redefining “landscape” from barrier to text. Agency drives escalation: bypassing sensors, mapping new data, broadcasting. Cost is the symbolic loss of the feather/childhood. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the polyp dance—celestial events relocated inside the abyss. Subtext in feather’s reprise: sky and sea share one rhythm. Final image transmits wonder without moralizing. Complexity preserved: no tidy resolution, only reconfiguration. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision (“bioreceptors,” “thermal vent cycle”) braided with lyrical cadence. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during discovery, longer breaths during reflection. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs (“pressed,” “groaned,” “sparkling”) replace adverbs. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the polyp pulse. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deep-sea constellations as living text. Feather reimagined from sky memento to current-meter. Risk in quiet, lyric closure paid off by resonant reconfiguration. No derivative templates.</comment>
