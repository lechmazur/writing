<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and personal, but her interiority stays largely observational; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. The final act of bringing descendants to the field is earned by her archival drive, yet the cost to her is only implied, not embodied. Secondary characters exert pressure only through photographs, not on-page interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s descendants witness the healed field and re-weight their own past. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of photographs, lavender growth, and communal acts accrete until the final image crystallizes meaning. One transition (attic → field) is clean; orientation is never lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly drawn and filter through Elara’s perception; the scent and color actively contrast decay. The setting constrains choice—only this reclaimed ground can host the communal ritual—charging the final gathering. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming communal pain into shared beauty. Pressure tightens as Elara deciphers the photographs and then physically returns the case; the final act forecloses her solitary quest by making it collective. Cost is communal, not personal, slightly blunting the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting pain into communal masterpiece emerges through images and acts, never stated. The lavender’s persistence and the arcs of stone and bodies re-weight the factory’s ruin into hope. Final image of descendants quietly reconfigures identity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s calm, precise perception; diction is consistent and slightly lyrical without purple drift. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture, which holds. No head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“grim monument,” “persistent burst of life”). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrasing fits Elara’s reflective lens and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-industrial healing narrative is refreshed through archival puzzle and living lavender archive. Specific detail—wild lavender reclaiming poisoned soil, arcs of communal art—grounds the concept. The synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
