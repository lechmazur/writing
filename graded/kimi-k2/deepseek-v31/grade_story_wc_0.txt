<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “quiet terror of deep-space mathematics” and “robotic” clearing motions reveal the armor. The shift from quantifying loss to cataloguing dust is credible, but the final humility feels slightly pre-articulated rather than earned in a single micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dust fragment layers pattern until the open-roof image reweights grief into renewal. Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—leaving the roof unrepaired carries visible cost and crystallizes her new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s broken glass, sodden soil, and surviving nasturtium leaf are tactile and selective. The open section of roof at the end physically constrains future choices—rain and dust will keep entering—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to metabolize private loss—tightens as the butterfly-wing cosmos undercuts her “preprocessed certainty.” One clear deepening: she renounces hasty repair, accepting ongoing exposure as cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-fragment emerges organically from dust patterns; no moralizing. Final image of open roof and incoming dust offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to live after ruin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is neutron-star precise yet lyric: “dust from a butterfly wing… held the secrets of a different kind of gravity.” Perceptual signature—mathematical, tactile, cosmic—remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances. Minor scaffold in “a form of emotional armor” could trim, but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the quiet insurgency it describes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star physics meets lepidopteran nanostructure to reframe grief. Risky quiet ending lands because the dust-as-cosmos motif is taught early and reweighted at closure.</comment>
