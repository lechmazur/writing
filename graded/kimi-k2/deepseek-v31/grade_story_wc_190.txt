<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers closing around the cool vial, the practiced leverage of the oar. Motivation (“teach silence how to comfort”) is dramatized through micro-choices: steering toward the arch, striking the gondola, watching the old woman unclench. The final smile is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than visceral; a sharper personal forfeiture would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the resonant hush reweights the entire soundscape. Closure is a Charged Poise—the crystalline stillness in glass and air—whose cost is the perpetual transit Elara accepts. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the “vaulting hush” could be slightly more embodied to feel the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Drifting Prism Terrace is evoked with selective sensory strokes—mist, crystal platforms, fused arch—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. The storm glass and arch function as micro-settings that constrain her method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. A touch more tactile consequence (fatigue, tool wear) would edge it to 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring a comforting silence—is signaled early and tightened through the rising drone. The decisive catalytic strike narrows options and transmutes noise into hush; cost is the endless itinerancy Elara embraces. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; one more tangible forfeiture (a cracked vial, a strained muscle) would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as crafted refuge rather than void. The storm glass’s feathery suspension and the old woman’s unclenching hands embody the idea without statement. Final image reweights the premise—silence becomes active comforter—through concrete particulars. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the fluid dip of the oar. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices vibrations, currents, crystal tremors. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression (“fluidly logical”) is taught early and paid off in the strike. Minor echo of “fluid” could be varied, but it serves pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Metaphors (crystals “shatter and swarm”) are apt and controlled. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. One near-repeat—“silence” used three times in two lines—barely grazes the ear. Closure line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<comment>Premise—sound-shaping gondolier of silence—feels fresh yet inevitable. The storm glass as noise-level sensor and the resonant arch are specific inventions that grow from character need. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring stakes. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
