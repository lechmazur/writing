<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s skepticism and grief are embodied in her cataloguing eye and visceral disgust at the waxen effigy; the contradictory calm that follows feels earned. The leap from historian to bone-setter is seeded via grandfather memory, so the final splinting is credible. Micro-choice—slipping away “shrewdly innocent”—reveals hierarchy of values. Cost is visible in the broken arm and the unspoken price of entering Faerie, but interiority flirts with diagnostic self-awareness (“a cleft in certainty”) that slightly blurs the emotional immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: effigy → tooth → portal → rescue, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: Aris stands before the Fae holding the tooth as bridge, cost felt in Leo’s injury and her trespass. Orientation is swift; the garden’s rules are learned through action. One minor causality wobble: the “thread of connection” from tooth to portal is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden’s iron-weeping fountain and oak-door constrain the rescue path; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s historian gaze. Spatial choreography is clean—needle-thin gap, cradle of roots, woven branches. The mirrored twilight world is sketched with just enough specificity to feel sharper, not generic. Micro-setting (tooth, sticks, linen) functions as charged objects that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Leo—signaled on page one. Escalation: discovery of tooth narrows method to Faerie trespass; setting Leo’s bone is the tightening act that forces immediate truce. Cost is visible (broken arm, Faerie attention). No reversal beyond the initial portal crossing, but the single deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of transforming mistakes into constellations emerges through the tooth’s re-purposing from evidence to treaty token. Subtext operates in the Fae’s silent watch and Aris’s unspoken bargain. Final image avoids moralizing; the thematic weight is carried by the white tooth against twilight. One thematic echo—“turn mistakes into constellations”—is slightly overt mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, historian-cool with controlled lyric bursts (“mockery that made her gorge rise”). Syntax tightens under stress: “She found two straight sticks…” shows rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which remains consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“nostalgic innovation”) risks register drift but stays within Aris’s scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density; each sentence advances image or motive. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and grounded (“oak so old its branches seemed to hold up the sky”). One mixed metaphor—“cleft in certainty open within her”—is minor. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fae abduction retold through historian-mother lens feels specific; the tooth-as-compass twist is fresh. Risk-taking in quiet portal entry rather than battle pays off. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without Aris’s skeptical profession and bone-setting heritage. Avoids stock changeling tropes by reframing the duplicate as forensic puzzle.</comment>
