<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hira’s contradictory impulses—quiet observation vs. explosive need—are embodied in the morpho-wing beat and the sun-trail trek; the final integration of the donor heart as “instrument of perception” is earned and costly. Interiority is specific to a dyer’s chromatic vocabulary. Minor slip: “quietly explosive” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the projected life-story reweights Hira’s premise, cost is the irreversible fusion of identities. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light, color, story density tightens to final image. Causality holds; only the Floating Rock’s physics is elided but taught as dream-logic early enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Valley-mist and sun-pools are vivid, selective, and bias-filtered through Hira’s chromatic eye. The hovering rock and vine anchoring are sketched with just enough spatial coherence to orient. The tea-house micro-setting constrains the final revelation, charging the morpho-wing projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why some magnetize stories—tightens when Hira realizes he is living another’s narrative pulse. One clear escalation: the wing’s illumination forecloses the option of remaining a passive observer. Cost is the loss of narrative anonymity; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of narrative magnetism emerges through concrete sensory particulars (dye, wing, light) rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: identity as accrued stories, not solitary self. Subtext in the old woman’s silence and gold-breath gesture avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: color-as-breath, light-as-path. Syntax modulates from measured stillness to luminous crescendo. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Hira’s chromatic cognition. Dialogue minimal but subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is disciplined to color-light motifs. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with trek and revelation. Occasional elevated diction (“iridescent caution”) fits the dyer’s artisanal lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: organ-donation as narrative contagion, dye-craft as epistemology. Risky floating-rock setting is justified by taught dream-logic. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without color-light-story conceit. Specificity of craft and heart-memory feels inevitable.</comment>
