<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is embodied (e.g., “watched Leo, not the sky”), and his softly adaptive trait drives the decisive choice to use the vial at totality. Leo’s silent awe is credible and embodied; the moment of hand-over-hand contact crystallizes a relationship shift. The cost—Leo’s first fragile smile—feels earned and scaled to the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the eclipse and vial together reweight Leo’s stance from fear to wonder with visible cost (tear + smile). Causal linkage holds: Silas’s adaptive method leads to the grove, the eclipse triggers the vial, the vial triggers Leo’s response. Orientation is anchored by “Sage Ridge” and “afternoon sun” within 120 words. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge and the oak grove are sketched with selective sensory detail (violet twilight, wind through pines) that filters through Silas’s calm focus. The vial becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: path → grove → totality → returning light. Weather (eclipse) directly affects action and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reignite Leo’s wonder—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the eclipse provides the single, irreproducible window; Silas’s use of the vial forecloses retreat. Cost is Leo’s tear and the audible fading of the ghost note. Agency rests with Silas’s choice and Leo’s embodied response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder as medicine emerges through concrete events (vial, eclipse, note) rather than statement. The final image—boy’s hand over therapist’s—offers a non-literal answer: grief is not erased but re-tuned. Subtext lives in Leo’s silent reach. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will the wonder last?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas with perceptual signature (“mellow,” “softly adaptive”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long calm sentences, then shorter pulses at totality. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual (“They listen”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “the world dipped into a premature, violet twilight” does three jobs (color, time, mood). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“veil,” “quiver,” “trace”) and selective modifiers. Final line lands with crystallized cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ordinary magic (rain rhythm, wind melody) is made specific to Silas’s practice; the eclipse-vial duet feels inevitable yet fresh. The hair-curl-as-voice avoids cliché by grounding in tactile detail. Transformation test: swap vial or eclipse and the story collapses. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
