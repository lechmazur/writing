<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Viola’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the pen-nib totem and proof-by-contradiction tactic reveal her logician’s mind under pressure. The final choice—to write a dull corrective column—earns its cost by the prior causal chain and the father-haunted legacy. Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat flows from the last (call → assumption → logical test → rejection → act). Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she actively intervenes, foreclosing the lie’s orbit with visible cost (boring page-five placement, defying profit). No orientation drift; telescope and clouds anchor early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s altitude and echoing dome mirror Viola’s isolation and the “orbits of regret” metaphor; the rosewood nib serves as micro-setting that constrains her final act. Selective sensory detail (copper receiver, India ink) keeps economy tight. Setting subtly guides choice via the telescope’s silent judgment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. profitable lie—is signaled immediately and tightened by the proof-by-contradiction exercise that exposes catastrophic fallout. One decisive turn: rejection of the lie and active counter-publication. Cost is legible: potential profit sacrificed, reputation risked, legacy protected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s gravitational cost emerges through concrete action and metaphor rather than statement. Final image—stars’ “silent, truthful dance”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the pen-nib and telescope resonates quietly; ambiguity lingers about future fallout, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly cool, reflecting Viola’s logician stance; diction (“totem,” “Q.E.D.”) stays within her lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under decision load, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined (orbits, black hole) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“blotted,” “unscrewed”) and concrete nouns anchor each beat. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical metaphor married to journalistic ethics, proof-by-contradiction as plot engine. Risky quiet ending pays off. Details (rosewood nib, copper receiver) feel specific rather than generic. Premise transformed through character rather than gimmick.</comment>
