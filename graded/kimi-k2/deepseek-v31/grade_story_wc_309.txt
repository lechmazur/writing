<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while mechanically unstrapping—grounds her arc; the embodied shiver and breathless collapse after mist-craft show cost. Motivation (“find the sacred in the simple”) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation of the spire is earned. Minor slip: “underachieving” is asserted rather than shown in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes as she turns her back on the automated world, keystone in hand, cost visible in her shaking exhaustion. Causal lens holds: each beat (light-pulse → mist-walk → folly → ice-slab → renunciation) links by therefore/because. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The icebound spire, frozen leather, and keystone’s warmth are selective, tactile, and constrain every move; the keystone’s glow literally charges the final image. Micro-setting (body, tool) functions as environment. One minor drift: “western balcony” is never re-anchored after first mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the ice slab threatens to erase the keystone. Escalation is causal: mist-craft exhausts her, narrowing later options. Cost is legible in her post-save trembling. No extraneous reversals; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mass-produced spells vs. hand-willed mist, keystone as memory of sunsets. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—automation cannot house “brilliant dimness.” Subtext in gesture (cradling the stone) carries the sacred.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s wonder-starved lens. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during ice-fall, longer breaths in aftermath. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Brilliant dimness” risks abstraction but is earned by context. Rhythm mirrors pulse of light and exertion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes (oppressed mage, lost wonder) are transformed through the keystone’s sunset-memory and mist-craft that costs breath. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
