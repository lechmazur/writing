<comment>Silas’s compulsion is vivid yet the inner contradictions that would sharpen end-pressure remain muted; his embodied awe arrives, but the absence of a felt flaw or risk that costs him something tangible at the plunge keeps the full charge just shy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the closing image reframes every beat as a cumulative densening toward silence. The decisive CR reweights the premise—"he became a part of the question"—and the cost (life-direction foreclosed, compass lost) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The subterranean lagoon is atmospherically rich and thematically resonant, yet its capacity to physically constrain action is under-deployed; the water is present but does not dictate Silas’s move—it serves awe more than obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Coherent pressure mounts: from ritual preparation to final immersion, each deepening sharpens the single stake—surrender to ultimate silence. The one decisive narrowing (compass points down, path sealed) is agency-driven and carries visible ontological cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The theme of silence over explanation emerges organically through image and ritual rather than assertion. The lagoon’s charged void offers an unobtrusive koan—resonance without moralizing—yet the final reweighting edges on the border of overt statement, holding it from absolute perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric is tightly controlled—syntax breathes with descent-pressure and the perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping, no register drift; subtle pattern-repetition in sentence openings adds incantatory rhythm without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with zero scaffolding or near-duplicates. Minor density in metaphor strings mid-passage (“hissing steam symphony”) barely grazes clarity and never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Petrichor collector meets psychometric spelunker: fresh synthesis. The compass/psychometry pairing feels inevitable once disclosed. While subterranean awe invokes known tropes, the inversion—surrender instead of rescue—renders the concept freshly risky.</comment>
