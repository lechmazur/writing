<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ansel’s interiority is embodied (cold fog seeking cracks) and his micro-choice to press the white thumb is earned by prior causality. The contradiction between compassion and analytical detachment is present but under-exploited; Carver’s recovery feels slightly convenient, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each looped phrase tightens the logical snare until the decisive thumb-press reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—the pigment is gone, the void re-priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Anchor established in two lines; the dimensional anchor’s muffled silence and palette/tool micro-setting constrain tactics. The white pigment’s final flare charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop possession—tightens as each loop narrows options. Agency is intellectual; the cost is the spent pigment and Carver’s near-loss. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (question as structure) emerges from recursive logic, not assertion. Final image reweights stillness from negation to understanding without moralizing. Subtext in layered audio and silence is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: ecclesiastical precision meets electronic recursion. Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives under climax. No POV drift; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“susurrus of broken logic”) fits priest-scholar voice. Minor decorative flourish does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: loop-pedal exorcism via Socratic recursion. Palette pigment as distilled nullity is specific and irreversible. Risky conceit fully commits and lands.</comment>
