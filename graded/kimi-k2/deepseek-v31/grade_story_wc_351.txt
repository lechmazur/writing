<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—graphite-stained hands, synaptic retraining—but the moment of integration (“his failure was now her foundation”) arrives as summary rather than embodied choice, blunting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked mirror’s fracture is accepted as integral, not fixed. Causal chain holds—modify device → receive seared memory → reframe goal—though the final beat compresses the decisive act into one declarative sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and brass apparatus are textured and selective; the periscope mirror’s crack literally refracts the visions that drive the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate of object-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inherit and redeem the murdered dream—tightens when Elara confronts the engineer’s despair; the cost is the psychic flood she must now carry. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme of restoration-through-fracture emerges organically from the mirror’s cracked glass and Elara’s neural rewiring; no overt moralizing, though the final line edges close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly metallic—apt for an engineer. No POV drift; perceptual signature (“liquid silver light”) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“ghost…quaking reverie”) flirt with overwriting yet stay legible. Clean rhythm, no loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-archeology via synaptic rewiring and a cracked periscope. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky; risk-taking supports stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
