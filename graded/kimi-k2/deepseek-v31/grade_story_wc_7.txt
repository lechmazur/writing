<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, tasting her own blank past—and her micro-choices (pruning, planting, plating) track motive to cost. The final self-taste crystallizes her arc with felt price. Minor slip: “hollow” is asserted more than embodied early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse shifts from ruin to promise, Elara’s future path now legible. Causal chain (seed → alignment → fruit → service → self-taste) holds under Causal lens with visible cost—her grandfather’s absence, her own prior emptiness. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is tactile—orange tears, clouded glass—and constrains every choice: space dictates pruning, alignment dictates timing. Final image recharges the setting as living promise. Micro-setting (mint leaf memory) also anchors early beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore feeling to a numb city—tightens when the fruit must be ready for the eclipse. One decisive intensification: plucking the luminous orb under eerie twilight. Cost is the risk of failure and the irreversible consumption of the single fruit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as seed for future growth emerges through action, never sermon. Final taste reweights “knowledge” from recall to forward-building. Subtext in the nurse’s calm certainty and businesswoman’s buried joy carries the idea without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is chef-precise yet lyrical: “conducted a symphony of memory and potential.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through palate and scent. Compression is taught early (“flavours that could rewire a mind”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (greenhouse “weeping orange tears”) are fresh and coherent. Final line lands clean with crystallized cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + synaptic fruit + gentle rebellion against civic apathy is a fresh synthesis. The greenhouse’s resurrection as living promise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky molecular-gastronomy metaphor pays off conceptually.</comment>
