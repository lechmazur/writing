<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard’s nightly healing mirrors her own psychic fracture. The final renunciation—ceding the need to send the letters—lands with felt cost. Yet the estranged sister remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology is no longer waiting because it has been felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the condensation rewrites the unsent letters. Cost is legible in the dawn weeping of the messages and the shard’s return to cold stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is rendered with tidal immediacy; moonlight on black water, singing spirits, and the salt-bleached window frame all constrain Elara’s ritual. The shard itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One notch shy of 9 only because the spirits’ physical impact remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the pre-decisional moment—tightens when the window begins to write her unspoken letters. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each sensory layer raises the psychic cost. A visible price is paid when the messages dissolve at dawn, foreclosing the option to send them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: forgiveness is not transmission but recognition. The fierce tenderness of the spirits becomes her own self-directed tenderness, reweighted by the final condensation message. No moralizing—just the image of wept words and a cooled shard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to tactile relics and tidal gloom. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences in the approach, shorter fragments at the climax. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests entirely on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty. Minor loop risk in “fierce tenderness” repetition, but the phrase accrues new weight each time. No figurative muddle at the peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—unsent letters writing themselves in condensation—feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Familiar tropes (estranged siblings, magical swamp) are transformed through Elara’s relic-reading vocation and the shard’s lunar healing. A fresh inflection: the apology is not delivered but metabolized.</comment>
