<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia and poetic vocation are vividly embodied—her barefoot sensitivity to soil-thrum, her lantern-lit postcard ritual—yet the “centuries of longing” reflex feels abstract, not lived. The decisive shift from chronicler to translator is motivated by the shell-song, but the interior contradiction between failure and vocation is told more than dramatized until the final carve. Still, her micro-choices (clutching the postcard, pressing ear to nacre, cutting words with shell) track a credible hierarchy of values and yield visible cost: she finally sleeps, surrendering her vigil. Enough specificity and earned change for high-band, but a hair shy of 9 because the longing backstory is asserted, not textured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the planetary scream subsides to sigh, Elara sleeps, cost is the surrender of her sleepless guardianship. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of ache→listen→translate→quiet—each beat deepening density rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never waver; no orientation debt. One micro-turn: the shell’s lullaby re-weights her task from description to translation, foreclosing her prior identity. Persistent constraint: the shell-song now requires her silence; price is legible in the final image of postcard over sleeping heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Monochrome broken-moon coast, fossilized cathedral-shell, postcard cosmos—each detail is filtered through Elara’s insomniac perception and constrains action: the shell’s curvature dictates her path, its nacre provides the stylus. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and hearing under crisis, then widens to reef-shadow joy, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms or impossible positions. Micro-setting (postcard, shell shard) functions as setting and tool, charging the final image—meets 9+ gate with room to breathe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate planetary pain or remain its failed witness—is signaled early and tightens when the lullaby offers a single, fragile alternative. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (soil thrum, shell silence, off-key wind) increases density until the carve becomes inevitable. Protagonist agency drives the turn—she chooses to inscribe the treaty, paying with her lifelong vigil. Cost is felt: the ache softens, she loses her sleepless shield. Sufficient for high band, though only one decisive pressure spike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as translation, not mere description, of trauma. The blossom-armistice concept reweights from abstract lyric to functional treaty via the shell’s song, avoiding moralizing. Final image—poet asleep inside the weaponized relic—offers resonant, non-literal answer: peace is witnessed, not manufactured. No thesis statements; complexity lingers in the irony that her “success” dissolves her identity as watcher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature: “shyly unstoppable” feet, “reef-shadow joy.” Syntax lengthens during listening beats, contracts during carve, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction remains within her poetic lexicon without purple drift. One microscopic filter-stack (“she felt,” “she listened”) but immediacy recovers—clean enough for 9-band, capped at 8.8 by minor filter habit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive: “paper cosmos glowing,” “blossom armistice”—figurative layers serve pressure, not ornament. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence rhythm modulates with listening vs. carving beats. One mixed metaphor (“reef-shadow joy”) is earned by prior oceanic shell imagery. Information density high; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor scaffold: “for the thousandth time” is stock intensifier, but it sits outside the closure beat—keeps 9+ range at bay yet comfortably above 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fossilized war-shell singing a ceasefire lullaby is fresh, emotionally grounded, and inevitable in hindsight. Postcard-as-constellation-map and pain-photosynthesis metaphor synthesize familiar tropes into singular vision. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, no human antagonist—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test fails: story collapses if shell song is swapped for generic oracle. Specificity and conceptual courage push into 9+ band.</comment>
