<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is luminous and embodied—“coalescence of ambient light and conscious dust”—but the inherited duty never collides with a contradictory impulse on the page; the break with generational non-interference is declared rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to refract rather than destroy is credible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the probe’s gentle echo and retreat constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the Garden’s stakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of gentle pings intensifies into a single decisive refraction—though the cost is lightly sketched rather than hammered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The Nebula Garden is rendered with synesthetic precision—“violet and amber vapors,” “cloud-deer’s birth”—and the gear-as-prism directly constrains the climax. Spatial anchors are immediate; only the probe’s entry vector feels briefly disembodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the Garden’s quiet beauty—faces a single tightening when the probe’s violent scan threatens calcification. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the price (loss of pure non-interference) is legible but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of generational pattern versus transformative empathy emerges through refracted light imagery without overt statement. The final image of the warm gear and drifting petal offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively lyric yet disciplined—“troubling serenity,” “quiet sigh of falling petals”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the probe’s softened echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Only a faint echo of template cadence in “a billion billion possibilities” nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cosmic lyricism with steampunk intrusion feels inevitable and fresh; the gear’s transformation from threat to prism is a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
