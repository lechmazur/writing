<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the link, fusing it to the console) and her shift from private study to species-level mission feels earned. The “balanced” trait, however, is asserted rather than dramatized in contradiction, and the cost of her final act (losing solitary refuge) is only lightly implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dome’s dissolution and Visitor’s ascent crystallize a new horizon with visible conceptual cost. Causal chain—link → sky-window → chart → gift-map—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The benthic city is sketched with selective sensory strokes (bioluminescent spires, cold basalt) that mirror Elara’s caged wonder. The link-as-tool and the dissolved dome act as micro-settings that directly constrain and enable her final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—humanity’s confined horizon versus cosmic possibility—is signaled early and tightens through each beat: obsolete charts, alien sky, transmitted course. The final tightening (Visitor’s ascent) is driven by Elara’s agency and carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of navigation-as-freedom emerges organically from concrete actions (drafting star charts, transmitting geometry) rather than statement. The dissolved dome reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about what “sailing on light” will demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly austere, matching an instructor’s disciplined curiosity. Sensory filtering (“feeble defiance,” “impossible clarity”) stays character-bound. No dialogue appears; internal monologue remains coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or motive. Occasional elevated diction (“latent energy,” “cosmic cartography”) fits the reflective stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with wonder and urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of deep-sea isolation with alien star-mapping feels fresh; the link-as-key and dissolved dome transform familiar first-contact tropes. Specificity of edge geometry as navigational language grounds the speculative leap.</comment>
