<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clarity of motivation (quiet, desperate craving for gentler ethics); embodied contradictions in motion vs retrocognitive paralysis trade cost; choice-driven internal cost; “steel cradling fragile tessera” anchors stance change. One minor slip—single voiced diagnosis line (offer “not panic, choice”) abstracts peak beat, slightly undercuts earned embodiment; otherwise strong interior arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure = CR: renaming act reconceptualizes historical failure into First Offering, legible felt cost (broadcasting data = social risk). Causal lens holds: every causal beat tightens (triggering memory → extracting tessera → broadcasting) until final repricing. Anchor achieved early (~65 words). Cost sentence precise: “the warm coldness of truth settled” reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shattered sky dome, iron lacework, and tessera slot on gauntlet all constrain tactics (sky-falls hazard, equipment slot). Detail remains selective and sensory (warm ash, ozone). Uses the tessera slot to charge final image. Spatial choreography coherent across the dry fountain steps. No slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake early: reclaim a moment’s meaning. One tightening beat forces Kaelen to broadcast data—risking ridicule—on the plaza whose silence has trapped him. Cost is social credibility and memory integrity, explicitly on page. Escalation causal under Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of alternative logic (soft mercy as survival strategy) synthesized from one scene’s specific events. Final renaming is Resonant Reconfiguration rather than moral exposition. Subtle irony: official records vs experiential data creates tension. Nearly clean—single brief thematic echo sentence about “mercy as glitch,” flagged but low-impact; still lands CR without overt sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Purposeful compression (“warm coldness of the tone”) taught early as perceptual signature; rhythm tightens under sensory pressure. POV stable throughout; interior free indirect flows clean. Occasional elevated diction (lacework, aberrant) briefly spikes at edge of POV range but justified by setting. Single cadence drift—three “of the” preps in close sequence—minor slip, does not obscure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density lines serve double duty (tool description + thematic resonance). Varied sentence openings maintain readable glide. Single mixed metaphor “cradle empathy in arms of steel” used once intentionally; no loop in final third. Minor redundant “It was cool against his palm, a tiny, perfect square ...” slight paraphrase loop—cuts <0.2—keeps story within high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms retrocognitive procedural into moral renegotiation; integrates empathy ethic, tessera slot tech, and historical revision into singular fresh arc. Risk balanced by precise craft; premise transformed through character stakes rather than decoration. Specific, not generic synthesis.</comment>
