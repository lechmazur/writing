<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cracked box under his thumb and the tooth/hair inside crystallize his contradictory impulses. The final resolve to speak his pain is earned by the prior accumulation of sensory memory and moral calculus. One minor slip: “bargained innocence” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box becomes a key, the path down “clearer,” the cost the perpetual weight of witness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final reconfiguration. No orientation drift; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, thin air, and ash-scent are selective and POV-filtered; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Milky Way reprise charges the ending. One missed beat: altitude’s physical effect on breath or balance could have tightened the moment further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry unearned grief forward—is signaled early and tightened once: from private contemplation to public testimony. The cost is the unending obligation to speak the smell of burning pine. No false escalation; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cracked box and the slow stellar dance: survival as shared, imperfect translation. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the child’s tooth and grey hair is devastating and unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, tactile, and firefighter-specific—“pine crown igniting,” “tree falling when it shouldn’t.” Rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or interiority. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“steel core wrapped in acceptance”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-fire survivor tale is refreshed through the porcelain reliquary and the mandate to translate pain into training language. Specificity of the tooth/hair pairing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent.</comment>
