<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s shift from passive collector to active scribe is embodied and earned; the grief is palpable, the choice to “become the wall” carries visible cost. Interiority is textured, though a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“odd historian”) nicks the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the axis has snapped, dreams are gone, and Alistair’s new role crystallizes with felt cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the diary → tapestry → writing arc tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is not mere backdrop; its bronze quiet and stacked stories physically constrain and finally absorb Alistair’s purpose. The tapestry fragment reappears to reweight meaning at the end, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the death of wonder—intensifies as Alistair realizes the library is a tomb; the deepening is driven by his own probing and ends with irreversible renunciation. One clear tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus extinction emerges through concrete salvage and the final act of inscription; no moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration. The bronze quiet itself becomes the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific; the hush of the silo saturates every sentence. No head-hopping or register drift; compression is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“metaphysical severing”) is earned by context. One minor paraphrase loop (“bronze quiet” echoed twice) keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The axis-slip as slow extinction of imagination is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; dragons as literal memory-anchors rather than symbols feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky elegiac structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
