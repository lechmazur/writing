<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet insurgency and plant-telepathy are vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. evolution) play out in the tactile moment of unsealing. The final choice to plant “seeds” rather than shout is earned and carries felt cost. Minor: her interiority flirts with diagnostic self-label (“insurgent grandmother”) once, but recovers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the amber splits, the seed-creature departs, and Elara’s stance crystallizes—tradition will evolve, not merely endure. Causal chain (kite → script → pressure points) is tight and legible under a Causal lens. One soft spot: the kite’s appearance is a convenient gust, but it complicates rather than resolves, so the cap is not triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Volcanic hot-springs setting is selective and purposeful: steam nourishes the seed, black soil hides the amber, geothermal mist guides decoding. The environment constrains the unsealing method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. preserve it—tightens once when Elara chooses to unseal. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of orthodoxy. One meaningful deepening suffices for the word count; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of living tradition emerges organically from the amber’s imperative and Elara’s final resolve; no moralizing summary. The kite-script-plant decoding sequence reweights the idea that wisdom can come from overlooked sources. Resonant without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—knobby fingers, earth-stained, plant murmurs. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences collapse into short pulses at the unsealing click. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“secret symphony of green”) are sparse and earned. One minor paraphrase loop (“amber globe warmed her pocket… constant companion”) but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-calamity reconstruction, plant-telepathy, and amber embryo seed-bird feel inevitable yet non-obvious. The insurgency is quiet cultivation—an angle rarely dramatized. Risk-taking (botanical decoding) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
