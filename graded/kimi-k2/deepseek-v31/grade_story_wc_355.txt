<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ariadne’s drive is lucid and embodied; her hands adjusting “a micron to the left” shows exacting need. Interiority is almost tactile until the ending slips into a slightly authorial generalization about forgiving noise. The earned turn—accepting the fireworks’ cacophony—pays visible cost by relinquishing her lifelong purity of silence. Flaw empathy would sharpen with one explicit earlier contradiction (e.g., a flicker of annoyance she must repress); without it she feels consistent rather than freshly conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of sound reveals expand until the final CR reweights silence. Orientation is clear by Sentence ~3 (“shadowed workshop under stars”) and remains stable. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the journal’s silent waveforms now include fireworks, redefining “variety of silence.” Cost is explicit—“celebratory chaos” becomes part of what must be endured, not merely endured in theory—so closure is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The workshop, the brass-and-quartz tuner, and even the clasp’s cool metal are handled via action rather than catalog. Each object constrains micro-choice and the final journal (now pressed to her chest) recharges the image. No anchoring or spatial drift; sense palette is tight to POV priorities. Slight over-purple “silken quiet, thick and deep” risks cliché but is isolated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover Grandfather’s empathy through sound. Pressure tightens from unlocking the clasp (one focused, causal beat) to realizing fireworks are part of the catalog. Cost is felt: purity of silence must accept noise, narrowing her future practice. Escalation is a deepening rather than a chain of turns; sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: silence is relative; noise is its precondition. No explicit thesis, but the journal’s reconfigured waveforms and Ariadne’s lifted gaze do the work. The fireworks as entry in the catalog offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. One stray line—“She had recovered not just a journal, but a worldview”—leans toward echo; it is brief enough to avoid heavy penalty but prevents 9.0+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, reflecting Ariadne’s auditory obsession. Tight sensory diction (“faint for most to hear”) distinguishes perception. Rhythm modulates with pressure: elongated “silken quiet” at open contracts into clipped “click. Not loud, but definitive.” No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal tone; it remains singular and anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “paint with sound” compresses craft motive and metaphor in two words. Minimal loops; one mild scaffold—“she looked up…she smiled”—is a payoff beat that warrants brevity. Early figurative layering (“world in its palm”) almost overwrites but is quickly traded for tool focus. Overall propulsion keeps gate; a few decorative adjectives (“magnificent, noisy silence”) flirt with excess but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Combines instrument-making lore, frequency unlocking, and sonic cartography in a fresh synthesis. Avoids sentimental “treasured memory” by showing waveforms as practical legacy. Risks lull in silenced-luthier trope but recasts noise as treasure, not irritant. Strong, specific through-line: if swapped to ‘her mother’s recipes’ the emotional mechanic fails.</comment>
