<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive heartbeat count is vivid and embodied; it limits her stamina and shapes her pacing. Julian’s fragmentation feels external rather than an interior knot of impulses—he suffers but his POV is absent. Their relationship is filtered through guilt more than live tension, so the crucible never quite heats. Renunciation at the end—she keeps defragmenting knowing the pain—earns a visible cost and fits her self-punishing drive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the continuing, relentless act of scraping Julian together becomes Earned Stasis—a refusal to stop that forecloses her own rest. Cost is legible on the page: “It hurts… It’s like being put back together all wrong.” Drive lens stays situational-coherent: pressure steadily tightens without causal reversals, only the deepening ache of endurance inside the closed scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dome, brass console, and inkblot are selective yet tactile; the spilled ink even doubles as a literal galaxy. Setting steers every tactic—only the console’s surface offers Julian’s prison. Micro detail of porcelain in her glove adds bodily constraint. However, the perpetual snow outside remains atmospheric rather than shaping an on-page choice, capping at 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reassemble Julian and extract post-mortem wisdom. Tightening is the gradual intensification of his agony and the reader’s awareness that continuation is a culpable act. Choice at closure is renunciation—she keeps going knowing the pain—visible cost. Agency is continuous motion of the shard; no outside coincidence dilutes tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: the ethics of retrieval at the price of further fragmentation. Subtext pulses through her tactile compulsion—“It’s the only way” contradicts Julian’s “all wrong.” Finale reweights the question rather than answers it: wisdom is paid in pain. No didactic signposting—only embodied consequence—yet final sentence stops short of a larger existential reckoning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Consistent third-person interior lens, perceptually shaped by Elara’s obsessive count and cold-numb precision. Syntax tightens under stress—“heartbeat one hundred twelve thousand” becomes rhythmic burden. Free indirect style stays clean. No POV slippage. If any minor slip, it’s that Julian’s dialogue occasionally risks omniscient exposition rather than broken glitch, but minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is compressed, rhythmic, mostly propulsive; occasional ornate cluster—“digital ghost, a shimmering, faintly electric impression”—adds texture without muddling causality. One paraphrase loop (“It hurts, Elara” and “It’s the only way”) is mild. Final sentence lands with spare precision. No scaffold redundancy at climax keeps it above 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratically “living dead” merges with analog soul-repair through spilled ink. Risky fusion of digital-ghost and ink blot cosmos feels inevitable in hindsight because the physical medium embodies the fragmentation. Tropes of afterlife upload are inverted—salvation is continuous scraping pain, not transcendence.</comment>
