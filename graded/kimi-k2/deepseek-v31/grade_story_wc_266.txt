<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior arc from fearful inertia to self-validated courage is embodied in tactile beats (hand stamped, step onto boat). Motivation is consistent, but the guides remain archetypal observers rather than crucible agents, so relationship pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens holds: ferry passage tightens stakes via toll demand → story → stamp → reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the star reweights the premise; cost is the irrevocable leaving of the old self.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Veiled Ridgeway, slow river, and shoreline lullaby are selective, mood-driven details that guide choice (mist hides faster channels). The star stamp becomes micro-setting that constrains future action; environment subtly mirrors internal shift without over-symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—claiming latent courage—is signaled early and tested by the toll demand. Escalation is quiet but causal: story payment → stamp receipt → recognition that courage was already owned. Cost is the irreversible crossing; no external reversals, but internal pressure tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: courage as internal possession rather than external prize. Subtext in guides’ silence and the star’s indelible mark avoids moralizing. Final image of “carrying the star” reweights the quest without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is consistent (cool air, saline hint, soft click). Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional rise. Dialogue is minimal but voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sky the color of a deep bruise”). High information density without overwriting; final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ferry-as-afterlife trope is refreshed by the toll mechanism (story for passage) and the star stamp as validation device. Quiet inversion: courage was never missing. Specificity of “unused courage waits” gives familiar quest a fresh angle.</comment>
