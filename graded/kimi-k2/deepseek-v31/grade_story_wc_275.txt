<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—preserve peace vs. confront truth—are dramatized through the ritual and the final decision to carry the chip; the embodied cost is the tremor that threatens her “perfect world.” Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic. The jacket and sandbag scrap anchor her inherited identity without exposition overload. Closure choice is earned and forecloses hiding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara refuses to bury the chip, sealing her new path with the oilcloth pouch. Causal lens holds: discovery of box → recognition of stakes → deliberate act of continuity. Cost is legible in the final image of the sealed weight she now carries. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and sandbag scrap function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the dome shelters yet imprisons, the roses receive her values, the scrap is literal ballast turned talisman. Sensory selection is filtered through Elara’s tending hands and memory. Final image of the sealed box recharges the dome’s silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor father by mending chaos—tightens once when the chip forces a choice between safety and truth. Escalation is causal: discovery narrows options to destroy or carry. Cost is felt in the tremor and the deliberate binding of the box. No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of continuity through chaos emerges from the ritual, the roses, and the final act of planting truth. Subtext lives in the sandbag scrap and the photograph’s silent accusation. Final image offers non-literal answer: peace is not escape but stewardship of inherited weight. No moralizing statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail—“leather softened by time and dust,” “patient, thorny strength.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is Elara’s gardener’s gaze and inherited perceptiveness. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet”) are precise and earned. Information density high: each sentence advances image or stakes. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bounty-hunter father’s legacy reimagined as horticultural inheritance. Tropes of post-collapse sanctuary and hidden data are transformed through Elara’s gardening ritual. Specificity of roses, sandbag scrap, and oilcloth pouch makes the frame irreplaceable. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off.</comment>
