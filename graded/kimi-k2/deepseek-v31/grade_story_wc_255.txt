<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—yearning for beauty while disdaining color—remains vivid and embodied. Her surrender of perspective as payment roots the final shift in a visible cost, earning the earned stasis. Yet the reciprocal transformation of Elara feels slightly external, tempering a full 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (plant lexicon) and tightens through density until the silent reed’s vibration crystallizes the Rubescence/aura payoff; the world reframes itself rather than the plot exploding. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she must now paint with an alien optic, a felt forfeiture. The causality is coherent without forced turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The courtyard reeks of furnace heat and basalt, constrains spatial movement, and in the final image becomes the listening site of the reed’s hum. Micro-setting (plants as semantic currency) enforces stakes. Fully satisfies the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Precise single stake: “awakening worth the price of sight.” Pressure tightens once—the offer of eyes—and the cost is the loss of ordinary perception. One meaningful deepening; no reversals but no slack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—truth in the resonance beneath surfaces—arrives through the literal pupil-swap rather than adage. The white bloom’s final muted presence re-inscribes grayscale as homage, reweighting the premise with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrically compressed, painter’s perceptual signature governs every line; “monochrome world a familiar cage of grays” teaches the pattern. Rhythm breathes at crisis and tightens at the silent note. Distinctive, undrifted POV voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sparingly figurative; each image does double work: “ghosts of a thousand hues” blurs craft and memory. Zero loops or filler; brevity yields velocity. Cadence alters with heat-to-cool shift at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Colorblind painter sees color swapped for radiance—subtle inversion that feels inevitable. Plant syntax, reed tongue, and turnaround come from precise material logic rather than trope scavenging. A fresh coordination of sensory and moral stakes without gimmick.</comment>
