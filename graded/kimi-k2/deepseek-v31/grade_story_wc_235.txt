<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for narrative order yet recoiling from the chaos she’s bottled—are embodied in her trembling hand on the scroll and the visceral jealousy of her past selves. The final renunciation of “distilling” in favor of “carrying” chaos is earned by the flight and the altitude-burned jealousy. Micro-choices (snapping the scroll shut, spreading arms to soar) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrative stance flips from containment to vessel, with the cost of burned-away jealousy and the irreversible sight of her own grave. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned dream-bleed intensifies until the tapestry image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The final sentence crystallizes the new stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cabin’s loam-and-rot scent, the stone marker’s grey speck, and the scroll’s tactile cracks all constrain choice: the smell triggers feral nostalgia, the marker fuels flight, the scroll becomes the vessel. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Environment charges the final image when the cabin re-solidifies after flight. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with unorderable chaos—is signaled by the grave-date and tightened when jealousy ignites. The mid-air reconfiguration narrows options: she can no longer “distill,” only “carry.” Cost is visible in the burned jealousy and the irreversible knowledge of her grave. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: chaos as wilderness to be respected, not tamed. The scroll’s redefinition from cage to vessel offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext operates in the scent of “sweetly rotten” nostalgia and the blurred face of the man. No final-paragraph sermon; the last line reweights prior material through image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “feral nostalgia… had teeth,” “jaded wonder.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s temporal disorientation with controlled elisions. Perceptual signature is distinct—dusty windowpane, loam-and-rot scent, tapestry vision. No POV leakage; tense and psychic distance remain stable. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “bottled tempests,” “altitude of perspective.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates during flight, breathes on the porch. No register drift or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lucid-dream cartography with chronological dislocation feels fresh; the grave-date twist is inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (time loops, dream logic) are transformed through Elara’s embodied jealousy and the scroll’s redefinition. Risky surreal flight is earned by earlier pattern-teaching. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
