<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia is voiced and embodied, driving the crawl through the service conduit where panic mashes against resolve; her motives—honor the vanished, endure the dread—are consistent, and her final witness stance crystallizes a credible, earned renunciation. Interiority is distinctive, though a touch of summation creeps in at the codex reveal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal chain holds throughout: tidal clock → conduit push → codex key → phase-door. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing via phase transition, reweighting “lost” to “translated” with felt pressure of potential loss. Orientation is clear and contained within the single tide window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ruined corridor debris, bioluminescent cable colony, and the oppressive “cathedral of ruin” are vivid, selective, and feed the stakes; the wet-sand countdown gives the body-as-clock texture. Undersea cables are rendered as stakes-internal symbols rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure ratchets through tide and tunnel; the codex discovery narrows options, forcing a crawl and risky translation. External ocean return provides escalating deadline; protagonist agency is to witness, not escape—an earned, cost-bearing stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of unremembered lives emerges as the ocean reclaims their signal; final image of carrying “memory of light” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext carries without declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is claustrophobic-breathy, interior panic leaking into syntax; perceptual signature—“cold metallic taste”—anchors POV. Rhythm shifts under tunnel squeeze. Headlamp cuts of light are choreographed consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is controlled, with sensory density and no loop. Overwriting only surfaces in one grandiose “cathedral” line. Read-aloud rhythm works under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes cosmic-horror and one-woman witness; encryption-by-ocean and translation-by-phase feel fresh, though cable stigma echoes familiar tropes. Risk taken with quiet, witness-based closure pays off.</comment>
