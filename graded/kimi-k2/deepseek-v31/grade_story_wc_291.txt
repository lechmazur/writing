<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied in tactile micro-choices (cataloguing features, thumb on ribbon). The pivot from clinical puzzle to empathetic awakening is dramatized through the shift in line quality and the ribbon’s re-weighting. Cost is felt: he forfeits his clinical detachment and accepts the emotional risk of “meeting” the victim. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-cooked in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait’s gaze reweights Ellis’s entire perceptual world. Causal linkage holds: ribbon → imagined pulse → empathic method → living portrait. The quarry mist presses against the glass as a charged poise, making the cost atmospheric and undeniable. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quarry-mist and frayed ribbon function as micro-settings that constrain Ellis’s attention and later charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (graphite hush, worn silk). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The ribbon’s tactile return in the climax reweights the entire visual field.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving a forgotten woman—tightens when Ellis’s method shifts from puzzle to empathy. One decisive turn: the ribbon handled with feeling rather than taxonomy. Cost is the emotional exposure of “meeting” her. Pressure escalates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sensory detail and cadence shift from clinical to reverent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between clinical sight and empathic vision; no explicit statement. The ribbon’s reprise reweights the concept of “mask” from disguise to promise. Final image offers a non-literal answer: Ellis cannot remember faces, yet now “sees” one—an earned paradox without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is graphite-cool, precise, then softens without register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: measured angles, furrowed hush. Syntax mirrors Ellis’s method—initially clipped, later longer, seeking curves. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and purposeful (“mist churned like a sleeping beast”). Sentence variety supports emotional modulation. Final line lands with crystalline clarity and no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—face-blind artist paints souls—feels fresh and fully committed. The ribbon’s transformation from forensic clue to empathic conduit is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of graphite, quarry mist, and frayed silk anchors universals. Risky empathy pivot pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
