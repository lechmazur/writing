<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelin’s interiority is precise—her “calibrated instrument of preservation” heart and blue-black fingers embody vocation. The moment she silently offers the locket to the grown son crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes the artifact she was charged to archive. Secondary character appears only at the end, yet the mother’s recorded voice exerts live pressure. One minor slip: “haunted euphoria” is named rather than fully embodied in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant leaps from archived abstraction to living encounter. Causal chain—locket → data → son—lands on-page with felt cost as Kaelin hands over the locket. Drive lens is Causal: each beat narrows possibility toward delivery. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty’s bioluminescent stones and salt-crusted niche are not backdrop; they guide Kaelin’s careful footing and locate the cache. Final image of the glowing jetty “bearing witness” charges the hand-off with luminous cost. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through archivist caution. One hairline slip: nebula color feels briefly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve and deliver the memory—tightens when the son appears, forcing Kaelin to choose between archival duty and immediate human need. Escalation is one decisive turn: the past arrives in person. Cost is the locket leaving her custody. No false reversals; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living covenant emerges through concrete objects and choices, never stated. Subtext in Elara’s calm voice log—“a mother’s covenant”—echoes in Kaelin’s silent hand-off. Final image reframes preservation as delivery, not storage. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the locket’s warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, tactile, and vocation-specific: “walnut-ink archivist third class,” “precious, irreplaceable fluid.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as the son approaches. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Kaelin. Dialogue minimal but weighted: “I was told I might find an archivist here” carries decades of hope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “salt-crusted niche,” “planetoid of grief.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances preservation ritual or emotional stakes. Metaphors are precise—“planetoid of grief” fits the cosmic setting. Final paragraph’s cadence slows to match the solemn hand-off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>SF premise of memory-archaeology via biological residue feels fresh, grounded in sensory detail. Locket-as-memory-bridge avoids cliché by requiring chemical steeping and proximate-cause method. Son’s arrival could risk coincidence, but the coordinates and Archive’s mission justify it. Specificity of walnut ink and bioluminescent jetty anchors the world.</comment>
