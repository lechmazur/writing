<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s survivor-ghost persona is vivid, but interior dialogue sometimes lapses into analytic summary (“a desperate need to find purpose”). A single decision—stepping into the mirror pool reconfigures his stance—earns felt cost and final agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal arc: incident (geode vision) → decision (permeate mirror) → altered telescope hunt. Closure lands on page: observatory eye now sees “invisible spectrum,” shift marked and irreversible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Floating lab’s ozone, thrumming capacitors and chilled breakers are sensorily vivid, anchoring time/place early. Lack of human clutter or body-environment friction keeps it from constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survivor’s emotional void to re-engineering an orbital eye; pressure coheres under lens of perturbation. One tightening choice (occupy dormant mirror) raises physical and existential cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from exploded crystal vision and abandoned future; final image reframes loss as open potential. Subtext avoids moral, closes with bleak exhilaration intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is taut, metallic, lyric; perceptual signature tracks ozone-cold metal chill. First-line tension with closing reprise echoes geode-to-mirror shift. Occasional elevated diction drift, negligible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>    <comment>Prose is rhythm-rich and information-dense; compression accelerates under final “quietest place” hunt. Occasional looped “cold metal” refrain minor flaw touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Trauma-to-awakening premise avoids cliché lens; encapsulates it via tense concavity. Quiet, earned finale outpaces twist shocks, fresh synthesis within 700 words.</comment>
