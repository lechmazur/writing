<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—rescue vs. conceal—are dramatized through micro-choices (erasing her own trail) with visible cost; the final renunciation is earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara seals the archive, reweighting the promise from possession to witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each artistic breadcrumb accumulates to the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Archive’s dust, petrified shelves, and obsidian pedestal constrain movement and supply materials for her charcoal/pigments; the seed-sphere charges the final image with rebirth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—rescue vs. protect the promise—tightens once when Elara chooses to re-hide the sphere; cost is the erasure of her own art. Pressure is coherent but one-layer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of volcanic tenderness emerges from the vandalized self-portrait and Elara’s mirrored act of loving destruction; the ending’s refusal to possess reconfigures the promise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile verbs and selective sensory focus; perceptual signature (“dust of millennia,” “whispers of rust and gold”) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“volcanic tenderness”) is earned by context. No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Familiar quest tropes are inverted: the treasure is left untouched, the map is destroyed. The synthesis of archive archaeology and emotional concealment feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
