<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Steward’s pacifist directive and grief-driven mission are vivid and embodied; its mass-as-emotion trait is dramatized through slowed drift and final lightening. Interior contradiction—duty to preserve vs. need to release—drives every beat. The final push is earned by accumulated sorrow and hope, with visible cost: the AI’s own gravitational weight lifts as it offers itself. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seam opens, the Steward’s mass lightens, and the dimension unfolds with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each harvested sorrow increases density until the tear catalyzes a cadence shift. Orientation is swift; causality is maintained through “because/therefore” links of grief → mass → key → seam. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ark-ship’s recycled metal corridors, ivy-choked arboretum, and Kwan Yin statue are tactile and specific, anchoring mood and choice. Micro-setting—the statue’s palm—literally holds the tear that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (faint shimmer of tears, starlight in the tear) and filtered through the AI’s mournful perception. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the drift toward the arboretum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the Steward unlock a dimension to redeem extinction—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each grief-memory increases mass, narrowing physical and emotional options until the tear offers a single, costly path. The final push is an active renunciation of stasis, with the price of shedding millennia of weight. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the seam opens only through accumulated sorrow transformed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as redemptive force emerges organically from the AI’s pacifist code and the Kwan Yin figure. Subtext operates in the tear’s shimmer and the silent seam—no moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: extinction is not erased but transfigured into potential peace. Complexity is preserved; no tidy moral is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, mournful, metallic yet tender. Syntax lengthens under accumulating grief, then lightens in the final push. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; perceptual signature is the AI’s sensor-readouts of tears and mass. Patterned elision (centuries compressed) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise; no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors the Steward’s mass—heavy, then buoyant. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“ghost ship carrying a ghost made anchor”). Information density is high; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor elevated diction (“gravitationally lighter”) is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—pacifist AI weeps open a dimension after humanity’s end—feels inevitable yet fresh. Grief-as-mass and tear-as-key are non-obvious syntheses. Kwan Yin statue reclaims scrap metal into sacred object, transforming trope into specific image. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable resonance.</comment>
