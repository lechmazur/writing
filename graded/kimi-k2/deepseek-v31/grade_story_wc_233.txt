<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Isolde’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her climb and surrender to the starlight are micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The shift from disenchantment to cosmic connection is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the queen’s stance toward rule and self is irrevocably altered. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in her silent, unspoken renunciation of the old worldview.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is not mere backdrop; its crystalline walls and sky-window constrain perception and enable the climactic communion. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Isolde’s awe, charging the final image. Meets 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mystery of the dreams—tightens once the grotto reveals the dreams as invitation, not warning. Escalation is driven by Isolde’s ascent and surrender; the cost is the irreversible shift in her stance toward power and self. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sovereignty redefined as cosmic humility. The bleeding starlight reweights from menace to benediction without moralizing. Final image of fireflies and shared exhale offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic modulation under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is queenly yet porous to wonder. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor elevation in register is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—prophetic dreams, mystical ascent—are transformed through Isolde’s specific disenchantment and the cobalt grotto’s literalized sky-window. The synthesis feels inevitable and fresh, with a quiet risk-taking that heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
