<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s nightly suffering, tactile anchor, and culminating acceptance are embodied and particular; the drive to "understand the shape of home" is dramatized via the feather and stone. Endurance without external interaction keeps the performance just short of 9-band crucible effects.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her final press of feather-to-stone seeds the cost of future endurance, re-weighting stance under the Accumulative/Textural lens without slack. The link between feather texture and route discovery is taut; cause/effect remains legible.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain and cavernous root-pedestal ground every beat; the lost-section geography constrains the path just enough. Sensory detail (grain of banister, root-leather pedestal) charges the final touch without tourism.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"understand the shape of home"—pressures escalate as each night’s truth becomes unbearable; stone-mediated translation reweights options. Only minor cost (nights still hurt) keeps it shy of 9.0.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: home is not refuge from truth but the hard grammar of reading it honestly. Final image reweights earlier agony into acceptance, avoiding thematic statement.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is cohesive, compressed, and internally textured; the mercury-glass metaphor recurs with purpose. Only one brief dialogue beat, perfectly subtextual, adds no drift.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; only one slight cadence loop (“twisting corridors” echo) under max pressure. Clarity at closure untouched.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile navigation + literalized book-mountain feels inevitable; stakes hinge on perception as geography.</question>
