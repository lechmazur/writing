<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, tracing, silent lip-movement—rather than labels. The final quiet smile and refusal to summon the captain crystallize her solitary triumph with visible cost: permanent isolation from the crew. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing intrudes. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky’s new scar reweights the premise and forecloses Elara’s anonymity. Causal chain—glow → cipher → coordinates → phenomenon—holds without gaps. Stranded luminance is introduced early and paid off in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hopscotch board, phrasebook, and starling murmurations function as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the “creaking masterpiece of brass and weathered oak” grounds the airship without catalog bloat. Environment subtly guides action: the glow’s timing dictates when decoding is possible. One hairline slip—“world was plunged” cliché—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the void’s coordinates lock in. The single meaningful turn is the moment the aurora becomes visible, foreclosing retreat or sharing. Cost is legible: lifelong solitude accepted in the final beat. Pressure escalates under the causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of solitary obsession versus communal belonging emerges through action and image, never statement. The hopscotch board’s transformation from child’s game to celestial map reweights the mundane into the sublime. Final image of the “permanent, beautiful scar” offers a non-literal answer to the cost of vision. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during decoding and softens at the quiet reveal. Perceptual signature—“living rivers of shadow and noise”—is character-specific and consistent. No dialogue, so no register drift; internal monologue stays within apprentice lexicon. Final cadence shift from fevered notation to crystallized awe is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“gentle, pulsating nexus of color” lands because it is the first chromatic naming of the phenomenon. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to sync”) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hopscotch cipher, stranded luminance, and starling murmuration feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of the lone genius and hidden map are transformed through tactile specificity and emotional cost. Risky quiet ending heightens resonance without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; the final image is singular.</comment>
