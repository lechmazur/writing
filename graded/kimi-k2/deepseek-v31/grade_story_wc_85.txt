<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—greed vs. guilt—are embodied in tactile beats (numb fingers, leaden stomach) and culminate in the on-page renunciation that costs her both client and self-image. The withheld-truth motive is dramatized, not labeled, and the final choice is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the client’s interiority is asserted rather than shown, slightly flattening the crucible moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s confession forecloses the lucrative lie with acute, on-page cost (“betrayed…crumbling to dust”). Causal lens holds throughout—each driftwood fragment tightens guilt until the watch-hand key triggers the decisive act. No orientation debt; driftwood method is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk and the watch-hand function as micro-settings that constrain the final choice; the terrace’s exposed height amplifies the irrevocable confession, while the watch-hand’s reweighted meaning charges the last image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“dark glass,” “ragged curve of grey sand”). One minor drift: “sieved hush” is evocative but not fully anchored spatially until late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to test the weight of her own deceit—is signaled early and tightens through each driftwood fragment until the terrace confrontation forces a public cost. One clear escalation beat: recognition of the watch-hand as key narrows options from fabrication to confession. Cost is visceral and on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of guilt-as-foundation emerges organically from Elara’s embodied choices; the final image of the watch-hand pointing to “uncertain future” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the client’s “eager and untroubled” face versus Elara’s “tempered regret” enriches the moral calculus. Avoids tidy resolution—ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: genealogist’s tactile, forensic attention to wood grain and crests; rhythmic control under pressure (“quiet but clear, fracturing the curated silence”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara. Compression and ellipses are purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“wave of tempered regret”). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. One near-miss: “sieved hush” risks abstraction but is saved by later contextual weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-shore genealogy via driftwood is a fresh, non-obvious frame; the watch-hand-as-key twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of craft (“edited pasts,” “family crest she recognized from a file she’d doctored”) grounds the premise. Minor risk: the royal-blood trope is familiar, but transformed through Elara’s complicity.</comment>
