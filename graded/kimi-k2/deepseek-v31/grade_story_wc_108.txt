<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—trembling hands vs. adaptive precision—yet the “phobia-ridden” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the dive; the final weeping ascent earns the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: betrayal → clue → dive → recovery; the dive itself is the decisive change with felt cost. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rusted library and black water are sharply etched; the seashell’s mother-of-pearl interior returns as charged image. Setting constrains the final choice—ocean as feared arena.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve proof while facing phobia—tightens once: the descent. Cost is visceral (gasping, weeping); agency drives every beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges through action, not lecture; the shell’s whisper reframes from taunt to truth. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and specific—“salt-tinged night,” “rusted lectern”—with rhythmic control under dread. No POV drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“transformative acid”) fits intensity. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<comment>Stunt-double phobia + offshore evidence cache feels fresh; betrayal weaponizes fear itself. Specificity of child’s cast clue and shell reprise elevate beyond trope.</comment>
