<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied trauma response and micro-choices under pressure are sharply realized; the photograph’s shift from anchor to stone is a vivid interior contradiction. Motivation—proving growth over scars—drives every beat. The final act of flattening the photo under a river stone is a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph’s re-exhibition and the deliberate watering crystallize her stance of active thaw. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the storm’s false thunder tightens the pattern, and the final image reweights the premise with visible cost. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum’s glass walls, cliff wind, and loamy scent are selective and purposeful, constraining her somatic method and charging the final image. The lighthouse beam’s empty rhythm mirrors her internal stakes. Micro-setting (the wooden shelf grain, cold glass) functions as tactile anchor under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she drown in memory or find a way to thaw—is signaled early and tightened once by the false-thunder trigger. The somatic counter-moves narrow options and carry visible bodily cost. No coincidence resolves; the storm only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating fragile optimism atop brutal realism emerges through concrete tending of living things; no abstract statement intrudes. The final image of watering after flattening the photo offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext resides in gesture and object handling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in sensory specificity; perceptual signature is consistent under stress. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift. Free-indirect style is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined and tied to POV perception. Sentences advance multiple jobs. Zero artifacts in peak beats. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is transformed through the arboretum keeper’s somatic discipline and the lighthouse’s automated emptiness. Specificity of plant care and cliffside glass gives freshness. Risk lies in quiet lyric mode; it pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
