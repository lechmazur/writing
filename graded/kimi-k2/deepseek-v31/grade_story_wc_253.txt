<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied in the slow, tactile ritual of whittling and the flat narration of mundane tasks; the contradictory impulses—grief-numbness versus sudden protectiveness—are dramatized when the lavender falls. The final shift from carving to weaving the bird is earned by the prior accumulation of silence and loss, and the cost (accepting fragility over control) is visible on the page. Minor slip: the “morally ambiguous” label is asserted rather than fully enacted in choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dried bouquet’s collapse triggers Elias’s pivot from whittling silence to weaving a fragile vessel for grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each repetition of shadow, hush, and wood-shavings thickens the emotional density until the single snapped stem reweights everything. Cost is legible in the final image of the skeletal bird on the sill, foreclosing the earlier strategy of carving away feeling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadows, and brittle bouquet are rendered with selective sensory detail that filters through Elias’s numb precision. The turbines’ sweeping darkness physically interrupts the scene, marking time and emotional eclipse; the dried flowers’ crumble constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (the scarred table, the hearth) functions as both stage and tool, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry unendurable grief—tightens when the bouquet’s decay forces Elias to abandon the safety of whittled silence. The single micro-turn (snap of stem → protectiveness) escalates under Accumulative pressure; the cost is the acceptance of fragility. No reversals beyond this, but the shift is decisive and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mandated joy and authentic grief; the story refrains from moralizing, letting the final floral bird embody the paradox of flight made from dust. Subtext resides in gesture—the shift from blade to weaving hands—rather than statement. The ending reweights the premise: silence is no longer cultivated as escape but as fragile vessel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and consistent with Elias’s blank-faced profession; the flat narration of mundane tasks becomes a ritual incantation that modulates under pressure. Syntax mirrors the slow scrape of the knife, then softens as he gathers petals. No POV drift; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; each sentence advances image or stakes without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“colossal shadows…silent eclipse”). No loops or register drift; the final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Happiness Mandate as dystopian premise is transformed through intimate, sensory focus rather than exposition. The floral bird feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing grief, silence, and resistance in one fragile object. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
