<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s scent‐loss and watchmaker friendship ring authentic; the interior contradiction between her need to heal and her inability to feel is embodied in the Birthing Screw beat. The moment when she stills the baby is earned by prior silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: Elara’s offer to handle the christening clock (choice) funnels into her epiphany that presence not scent is the miracle. Closure pivots on Charged Poise as she cradles warmth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Water-clock shop and morning fog are specific tools: dripping intervals frame decision tempo. The screw’s micro‐setting constrains and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A single run of pressure escalates—Silas demonstrates reading the fog to show Elara how to read human presence. Cost is the irrevocable loss of scent orientation as she pivots from cartographer to compassionate witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme “reading between lines” is dramatized: the non-smelling mapmaker learns that the unscented heartbeat of a baby is the perfect interval. No tidy moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is accruably textured—drip-and-screw imagery loops with variant rhythm. No scaffold; each sentence forwards pressure or tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
