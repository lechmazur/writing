<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s taciturn practicality is embodied through tactile micro-choices (hand worrying glass, dropping to knees mid-haunting). His protective impulse for the archive crystallizes from accumulated loneliness rather than stated trait, granting credible motivation in the final defiant “No.” A slight shortfall: the interior monologue lapses into summarizing “bottled feeling of safety,” which edges toward therapist-speak and blunts the embodied contradiction that could have lifted the character work to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Elias’s cairn of tools reconfigures the haunting from threat to negotiated stasis. The felt cost—“You don’t get this light”—is explicit, and the inferred Accumulative lens holds as every image (letters, glass, bluff stones) converges in a single weighted beat. Minor causality stutter: the ghost’s instant retreat feels near-magical, but the tower setting supplies the logic (geometry repelling mythic grief), so the break is thin.</comment>

<comment>The lantern room is rendered via temperature, metal clangs, and salt grief, all filtered through Elias’s wary practicality. The stones on the bluff are never visually described; they function as abstract semaphore, so the micro-setting is under-furnished. Still, the room’s gear teeth and grating cold actively constrain the cairn act, and the sea glass warms in hand, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting the archive—intensifies as each groan lowers temperature and threatens to erase the private light. Escalation occurs through one decisive deepening: the haunting fixates on the letters. Cost is visible—risk of physical safety and forfeiture of remaining night rest—yet the ghost’s rapid retreat tempers the price felt at the closing beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—solitude transmuted into guarded communion—emerges through concrete action: stacking letters turned to stacking tools. The final image offers non-literal answer rather than moral: human geometry as fragile armor against ancient grief. Subtle resonance, no overt sermon, but the articulation is slightly undercut by Elias interiorly spelling out “shared flame.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-tight, economical, rhythmic. Syntax flexes under pressure—clipped fragments during the chill, a single stone-simple refusal. Perceptual signature is Elias’s sailor-cargo lexicon: “fuel levels, grocery lists, rotation mechanism.” One fleeting drift into abstract “bottled feeling of safety” is negligible against sustained coastal grit.</comment>

<comment>Line-level craft exhibits high density, zero loops, vivid sensory selection. Every noun earns keep: “rotary gears, iron grating, frost-scaled glass.” Occasional lyric height “luminescent ache of human connection” grazes purple but serves the Accumulative pulse without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sailor’s practicality meets folkloric haunt, and cairn of wrenches becomes improvised sigil. Not paradigm-shattering, yet the transformation feels specific, lived-in, and non-obvious. Close echo: “ancient grief seeking entry” risks familiar gothic trope, but tactile tool stack rescues it to final specificity.</comment>
