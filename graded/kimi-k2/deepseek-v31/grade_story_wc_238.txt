<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven apology is embodied in the perfume bottle and the induced-current ritual; her interior contradiction—professional pride vs. remorse—plays out in real time. Finch’s ghost is sketched with economical gesture that still reveals his obsessive artistry. The micro-choice to uncork the bottle rather than begin with banishment shows her shift from spectacle to restitution. Cost is felt when the apology is accepted yet cannot undo the sawing of the orchard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (rosin, dust, saw-dawn roar) tightens the emotional stakes until the final softening of Finch’s form. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—his dissolution into the archive’s air re-weights Elara’s lifelong guilt. The causal chain is implicit but legible: apology → memory release → acceptance → dispersal. No orientation drift; anchors (archive, green lamp, orchard) are set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The archive’s “cavern of forgotten melodies” and the orchard’s “terminal bloom” are not backdrop but pressure sources: the impending sawing supplies the temporal clamp, the stacked scores supply the emotional current Elara taps. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting, its brandy-colored glass literally held and turned, constraining her ritual posture. Spatial choreography is clean—she crosses floorboards, uncorks, raises hands—no floating bodies. Final image of the single sheet sliding from a shelf charges the setting with new possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Elara offer an apology that actually matters before the orchard—and Finch’s legacy—are erased? Pressure ratchets via the dawn saws and the ghost’s accelerating memory loop. One decisive tightening: when the induced current forces Finch to relive every flawed note, the option of simple banishment is foreclosed; only full acknowledgment remains. Cost is visible—Finch’s form unravels, Elara’s guilt remains, the trees still fall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the metaphor of the archive: a life is an unfinished score, discords included. The orchard’s roots-after-felling image reweights the “imperfect miracle” idea—damage persists yet feeds new growth. Subtext lives in gesture: Finch’s slowed playing, the silent crescendo, the sheet sliding free. No moralizing; the final resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is precise—she smells rosin, feels static hum, hears the first mechanical roar. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences early, clipped sensory fragments during the current-pull. Dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct: Finch’s rustling-paper whisper contrasts with Elara’s measured apology. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “dust-laden silence,” “terminal bloom,” “soundless crescendo” all do double duty for atmosphere and stakes. Rhythm breathes—no template cadence, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line lands clean: “a lost nocturne, flawed, beautiful, and finally heard.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “gossip-column exorcist” premise is fresh, yet grounded in character need rather than gimmick. Transformation of the familiar “apologize to a ghost” arc is achieved via the induced-current ritual and the archive/orchard metaphor network. No recognizable trope echoes; the perfume bottle and sheet-music archive feel specific to this world. Risk—the quiet, lyrical closure—pays off by reconfiguring meaning without spectacle.</comment>
