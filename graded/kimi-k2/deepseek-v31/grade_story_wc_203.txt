<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. private compulsion to “see what ceilings hide”—is embodied in the moment he drags the desk and chooses to speak to the ghost. The cost (breaking his lifelong rule of non-engagement) is felt in the single line “For the first time, Leo chose to engage.” Flaw and competence are balanced; the ghost’s pressure forces a micro-choice that reconfigures his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Leo’s vocation compels him to look up, therefore he finds the mainspring, therefore the vision, therefore the decisive act of witness. Closure is a Decisive Change—he speaks, the ghost dissolves, and the rule of non-engagement is broken with visible cost (“his voice rough in the absolute silence”). Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The abandoned ticket office is rendered through Leo’s technician gaze: dust as “geological record,” the child’s scuffed shoe under gray blanket, the counter’s ornate plaster—all constrain access to the ceiling cavity. The mainspring barrel itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (smell of old popcorn, cold metal) is filtered through POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: witness the ghost’s untold heroism. Pressure tightens once—Leo’s rule against engagement collides with the girl’s pointing finger and the revealed mainspring. The tightening forces the single irrevocable choice to speak, paying the cost of broken detachment. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between seeing and being seen: ceilings hide both mechanical hearts and unwitnessed courage. The cracked façade literal and figurative refracts through the mainspring and the ghost’s fracture. Final image—dust motes rising like “lazy confetti”—offers a non-moralizing resonance: acknowledgment dissolves the weightless burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is technician-poetic: “vertical intestines,” “dust motes drifted…like lazy confetti.” Perceptual signature is consistent—elevator mechanic’s tool-centric diction, precise spatial mapping. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates under pressure: longer cadence for reflection, clipped sentences at the moment of engagement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“dust as geological record” primes the final dust-mote image). Strong verbs (“dragged,” “pressed,” “gripped”) anchor action. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + ghost-witnessing + horological relic in forgotten circus. The mainspring as literal heart of both clock and story is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—quiet ghost story without horror tropes—heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of occupation and setting prevents template drift.</comment>
