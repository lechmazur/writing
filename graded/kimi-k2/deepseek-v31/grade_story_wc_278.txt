<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt is embodied in the amber and the ghost-voice; her micro-choice to braid rather than erase the memory is earned and costly. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. The final silence is a felt renunciation, not a tidy cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ghost-voice intensifies, the amber re-weights, the letters crystallize method. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the silence becomes “whole presence”—with visible cost: the copper disc forever holds the fused sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” is tactile—brass horns, wax cylinders, spider-webbed wires—and the copper disc becomes the charged micro-setting that anchors closure. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the guilt—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the ghost-voice invades; the tethering act forecloses denial and carries the cost of permanent integration. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid of guilt and comfort; no moralizing. The final image of the disc as “fixed star” reweights prior motifs without statement. Complexity lingers: silence is no longer absence but living harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara hears the world as frequencies and static. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; final paragraph lands with crystalline cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Premise—acoustic binding of ghost-memories—is fresh and fully committed to. The synthesis of physics, lullaby, and penance feels inevitable. Specificity of tools and method resists genre templates.</comment>
