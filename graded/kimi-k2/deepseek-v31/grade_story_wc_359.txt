<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and synesthetic, but the bell ringer’s “quiet desperation” is stated rather than embodied; the final renunciation of ringing is earned by the prior longing, yet the cost feels more abstract than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new color seeds the world and the silence now “has a color, and it was gold.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the sculptor’s chisel provides the catalytic beat that tightens the harmonic resonance. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s sculpted hush and auroral fissures constrain every action; the ice block becomes a prism that literally shapes the climax. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and filtered through synesthetic bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—certify wonder—is signaled early; pressure deepens when the fossilized song must be liberated. The tightening occurs at the harmonic convergence; the cost is the exhaustion and the disappearance of the ice instrument.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of silence into color; no explicit moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: wonder is not accidental but latent, awaiting release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; synesthetic perception colors every sentence. Rhythm modulates with the rising harmonic, and no POV slippage occurs. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One minor scaffold—“a silence so profound and perfectly formed it felt solid”—could be tighter, but it does not dull the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The fusion of synesthesia, fossilized music, and auroral light into a new color is a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
