<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority shows contradictory impulses (pacifist vs manipulator) and embodied emotion under pressure; the final surrender of resentment is earned through prior causality and felt cost in Kael’s physical release, but one line edges too close to therapy-speech; strong but not perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Kael releases resentment and the ghost melody rises, reconfiguring the destabilizing world with visible cost. Causality holds: Lyra’s convincing Kael triggers the harmonic shift. One brief orientation drift early is excused by the lyrical frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Open, breathing obsidian walls and the mute music-box object constrain every move; the sanctuary’s silence is an active antagonist tightening options and charging the final image of resurrected resonance. Minimal exposition, maximal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A single, coherent stake: teach resentment to release its bitter hold before reality fully tears apart. Pressure escalates from mute box to glitching air and ghostly melody under situational force; final harmonic shift makes the cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete objects and final resonance: that memory and bodily history—rather than perfect mechanism—can guide chaos into coherence. The ending offers a charged, non-didactic reprise without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled lyric register and restrained diction throughout; perceptual signature (Lyra’s cellular lens) holds. One brief overlap when Kael’s interior flickers beyond his own sensory channel causes a micro wobble but fits the collapsing-reality frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Kinetic sentences ride breath control and rising tension; no figurative muddle, zero loops or scaffold. A single over-worked consonantal phrase in the “palpable void / noise went to be unmade” couplet nicks it, but momentum is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Novel synthesis of pacifist cellular manipulation with harmony-driven apocalypse feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking is intrinsic to concept yet clarity never falters.</answer>
