<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thea’s interior contradiction—haunting optimism against communal grief—remains embodied in every beat; her nightly sewing of air and stone is a micro-choice that visibly costs sleep and safety. The final renunciation of “rebuild as before” is earned by the prior dream-walking labor and the quartz veins she etches. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is solo and complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s stitching adds density until the pattern itself reconfigures the world. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the returning tide now flows along her quartz seams, a felt cost paid in irrevocable change to both canyon and village. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, damp sand, and the quartz-threaded basin are rendered with tactile economy; the labyrinth’s water-veined transformation at the end directly constrains the villagers’ new ritual path. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Thea notices rope fibers and salt scent before grandeur. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find a new way to honor the sea”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each night’s dream-walk deepens the pattern until the final tide irrevocably rewrites the canyon. Cost is the irreversible alteration of ancestral stone and the communal loss of old stories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of mending rather than replacing emerges through the act of sewing new veins over faded hubris; no explicit moralizing. The final image of water following quartz threads offers a non-literal answer: reverence is a living path, not a monument. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“orchid solace,” “ghost of all they had lost”—with rhythmic control that tightens under pressure. POV remains tightly focalized through Thea; no head-hop. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“sewing the air itself”) are fresh and internally consistent. Sentence rhythm modulates with the dream-state cadence. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>The fusion of textile craft, dream-walking cartography, and geological transformation feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky lyric mode is sustained without gimmickry; the canyon becomes both loom and map. No derivative echoes.</comment>
