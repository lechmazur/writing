<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aetos’s quiet scholar-warrior duality is embodied in every micro-choice—moistening the pellet, tracing glyphs, channeling force—yet the interior contradiction (crusher of stone vs. tender scholar) never collides in a single beat; the final renunciation is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (ink, rune, drift, channel) links because/therefore to the decisive reversal. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—the pretender’s tether severed—paid for by Aetos’s exposure and the library’s further ruin; cost is legible in the deeper silence and the pellet left as period.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The temple-library is no backdrop; its collapsing starlit grandeur supplies the rune’s astral logic, the ink’s permanence, and the final weaponized reflection. Dragonhide folio, fractured dome, and drifting constellations all constrain tactics and charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—legacy theft—tightens once when the pretender appears and the rune is activated. Escalation is causal: discovery → inscription → confrontation → reversal, each step narrowing options and exacting the cost of exposure and ruin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy vs. usurpation emerges through concrete objects (ink, rune, library) rather than statement. Final image of the pellet as period reweights the premise: truth endures even as stone crumbles, a resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lapidary, archaic yet precise—“regally unpretentious grace,” “cathedral of knowledge slowly returning to the void”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under threat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains tethered to Aetos’s scholar-warrior duality throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“ink burning truth into the page”—never crowding the climax. Syntax modulates with pressure, from measured cadence to clipped final exchange.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a pocket-sized titan librarian waging cosmic justice with marginalia and ink. The rune-of-drift concept, the library as weaponized archive, and the pellet as both stylus and period feel inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming familiar fantasy tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
