<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s frugality of observation versus surrender is embodied in micro-choices (tracing numbers, pressing tile, finally resting palm). Interior contradiction—logic vs felt mystery—drives the arc; the final renunciation costs her lifelong epistemic stance. No stock phrasing; emotion is embodied in warm stone, cool tile, and the hush between stars. The change is earned: her “endless wealth” is the inverse of her former scarcity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: each failed sequence tightens the lock until surrender becomes the only remaining move. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance toward knowledge is repriced with visible cost (“frugality of spirit replaced”). Orientation anchored by word 30; lens is Causal. No teleporting props; tile’s state change is on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The reimagined ziggurat’s warm stone and schematic walls constrain every attempt; the chamber’s geometry literally frames the final shift. Micro-setting (tile as tactile anchor) functions as extension of body and mind. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s priorities—numbers first, then texture, then silence. Final image of dark, inert tile recharges the opening glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal covenant or fail—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each failed formula drains resolve until surrender becomes the single viable tactic. Cost is felt in the “foreign” frustration and the irreversible abandonment of empirical certainty. No coincidence; failure is authored by her own limits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge vs mystery—emerges through action, never statement. Subtext lives in the silence after numbers fail. Final image of “endless wealth” reframes frugality without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the covenant is sealed but never explained, inviting reflection rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is astronomer-precise yet lyric: “schematic representations of orbital paths” beside “dusky harmony.” Syntax mirrors her shift from calculation to breath. No POV drift; perception stays strictly hers. Compression (“she simply offered her presence”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “numbers…fifteen—a simple, elegant constant” does triple work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“weight that was empirically ironic”). Final cadence slows to match surrender. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian ziggurat + magic square as encryption of devotion. Trope inversion—puzzle solved by abandoning solution. Specificity of “terracotta tile” and “plum-colored sky” grounds the mythic. Risky quiet ending lands because prior beats earned the silence.</comment>
