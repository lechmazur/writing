<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Vance is credibly drawn—his lonely drive and risk-taking embody the mission, not simply state it. Interior contradiction (rescue vs. desire to “harness the ephemeral”) stays active through the beats. Micro-choice to open the vial overrides every instinct and reconfigures both stakes and emotional position with visible cost. Earned renunciation of violence feels specific to this character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure hinges on a single, decisive change: releasing the consciousness instead of fighting. Accumulative lens holds—the narrative’s cadence shift reweights the premise when the light merges with both beast and man, charging the final image. Orientation is clean within ~120 words. Cost is physically legible in the tremor of the temple and Elias’s oxygen alarm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The drowned temple is not backdrop; its water clarity and stone geometry pressure movement and constrain escape routes throughout. Coral spires and alien constellations prime later recognition of the civilization’s memory library. The final stone-to-memory transformation uses micro-location to crystallize stakes. Environment, tool (vial), and body align to charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage the consciousness vs. survive the guardian—tightens when Elias chooses release over defense. One deepening: the guardian’s recognition reconfigures meaning without new external movement. Agency drives the climax; coincidence aids only when it amplifies stakes. A clear, felt price: he becomes custodian of an entire civilization, ending his solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: preservation versus appropriation. The submerged library body politic subverts “salvage” into stewardship. Subtext surfaces in the guardian’s eyes shifting from rage to weary trust, conveying centuries of isolation. Final image—Elias bearing the memories—offers resonant non-literal answer without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is specific: Vance’s selective noticing of geometry as pressure points, his bodily calibration under crushing depth. Syntax tightens in live beats (“His oxygen alarm blaring”). No head-hopping; camera stays in his skull. Voice modulates from clinical awe to urgent surrender without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Compression is dense; most lines advance momentum or charge image. No visible loops or synonym churn. Figurative language (“a river of captured memory”) lands once and pays off when the beast stills. Prose propels under pressure; final image crystallizes without overwritten flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—abandoned temple as memory vault—feels inevitable yet fresh. Guardian as mad curator flips the monster trope into tragic custodian without exposition. Risk of sentimental final image avoided by the weighed cost of bearing an entire civilization’s memories. Specificity grounds the lyric ending.</comment>
