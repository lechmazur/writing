<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arawn’s involuntary candor is embodied in the unbidden “I am afraid” line, grounding his flaw in scene. The micro-choice to sacrifice city lights for the hives crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt in the single lantern flicker above a darkened city. Interiority stays specific, though the grandfather’s ethos is slightly abstracted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → drained capacitors → riddle → battery → hive restart. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—tower stays dark, bees live. Orientation is anchored by line 3. One minor ellipsis: how the battery’s unique frequency is known is elided but doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The tower’s iron skeleton and hollow grounding compartment constrain the final choice; the lantern’s single flame recharges the opening dusk image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (battery compartment) functions as setting that alters tactics. No static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—city’s food versus light—is signaled early and tightened by the irreversible battery choice. Escalation is causal: each diagnostic beat narrows options until only one path remains. Cost is legible in the tower’s enduring darkness. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder over function emerges organically from the hive hum and the empty honey-scented box. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the unopened box and the single lantern. No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, slightly archaic, consistent with a solitary technician. Perceptual signature shows in “sky the color of spilled honey and wine.” No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “the humming conduits were silent” does double duty. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are spare and apt. Final sentence lands with cadence shift. Minor elevated diction (“luminous”) fits the elevated moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blackout, bee drones, and lightning tower as life-support triage. The empty honey-scented box is a non-obvious payoff. Premise is specific to this world; removing any core element breaks the logic. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
