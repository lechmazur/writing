<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “functionally creative” trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—aligning the sextant, tracing pipes, rerouting power—each with visible risk and embodied cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; the “stoic wonder” is shown in breath-held stillness and grease-stained fingers. The final stance crystallizes her values: she accepts the cost of salvaging a future rather than preserving a past. One minor slip: the phrase “equations for hope” edges toward abstraction before being grounded again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s rebirth is legible in the starlight flooding the atrium, and the cost is the irreversible expenditure of the carnival’s residual power. Causal linkage holds—each beat (sextant alignment → hatch discovery → capacitor reroute → hydraulic resurrection) follows “because/therefore” logic. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One hairline slip: the hydraulic system’s decades-long dormancy is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The terminal’s corpse-cold tiles, fractured dome, and dripping conduit are filtered through Elara’s engineer gaze, constraining every move. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting, its brass arc guiding body placement and tool use. Sensory hierarchy is tight—ozone, condensation, starlight—each cue tied to choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting the station’s potential—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the capacitors’ charge is finite. The single reversal (dead maze → living refuge) is earned by her redirected-flow engineering, not luck. Cost is visible: once the power is spent, no second resurrection is possible. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between obfuscation and transparency: the carnival’s transient neon versus the enduring starlight. The maze’s original intent (to hide) is repurposed (to reveal) without moralizing. Final image—starlight through cleaned glass—offers a non-literal answer: hope is not built but uncovered. No thematic echo in dialogue; subtext stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her analytical urgency—short percussive clauses during rerouting, longer cadences during wonder. Diction is precise yet lyrical (“grimy ceramite,” “residual charge”). No filter-verb clusters. Voice modulation under stress is evident in the clipped “Conduits hummed. Gears groaned.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, and information-dense; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“tomb of discarded joy”). No loops, no synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“skeleton waiting for a new nervous system”—is brief and doesn’t recur. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of archaic sextant and derelict spaceport tech feels fresh; the maze’s obfuscation-to-revelation arc is a non-obvious twist on “abandoned station” tropes. Specificity of hydraulic floor-shifting system grounds the premise. Transformation test: swap sextant for generic key and the emotional calculus collapses. Risky choice of quiet, starlit closure pays off.</comment>
