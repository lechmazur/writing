<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“hands still dusted with flecks of precious foil,” “breathing slowed to match the rhythm”—but the final renunciation (leaving the mountain with the collected textures) is more stated than dramatized; the cost is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each flicker of the lamp layers a new stratum of invented history, culminating in the Earned Stasis of Aris closing the notepad and descending. Closure is legible, with the conceptual cost of solitary custodianship, though the physical cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, stone pavilion, and failing fluorescent lamp are not mere backdrop; the lamp’s hum literally refracts time, and the bonsai’s disciplined growth mirrors Aris’s own restraint. Environment constrains and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting textures of time—escalates through each refracted vision, tightening until dawn steadies the lamp and the visions cease. The cost is conceptual (solitude, endless return), but the tightening beat is more accumulative than decisively narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of invention versus record, the solitude of custodianship. The final image of Aris descending with “a universe of histories” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent—“gilded-leaf stationer,” “incandescent restraint”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is sharp and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, every sentence advancing texture or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative language is purposeful and paid off. The final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes the closure image flawlessly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—time as tactile texture harvested from a failing lamp—feels inevitable in hindsight, a fresh synthesis of sensory metaphysics and quiet labor. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, no dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
