<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sparrow’s interiority is vivid—his fingers worrying the kerosene rag, the chemical chant—yet the shift from passive observer to active catalyst is slightly under-motivated; the mosaic “RISE” sparks him, but we don’t feel the prior despair in his body. The final renunciation (walking away) is earned, but the cost is more communal than personal, softening the sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the people rise, the silence is “brighter,” and Sparrow’s exit crystallizes his stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each firework is a density increase that reweights the stake—until the crimson plume writes “RISE” and the courtyard’s posture visibly changes. Cost is legible in the spent rag and the thinning dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The starless night and closed stone petals create a suffocating micro-setting that directly constrains Sparrow’s choice to ignite rather than speak. The kerosene rag doubles as portable setting, its fuel-soaked texture anchoring every beat. Final image of the brighter silence recharges the initial “hush.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defy hopelessness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each bloom; the mosaic command escalates the task from display to dialogue with history. The final mine aimed at the floor forecloses retreat: the word must burn. Cost is visible in the spent materials and the irreversible public awakening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as insurgent light emerges organically from the chemistry lists and the fiery script; no moral is stated. The word “RISE” shifts from ancient command to living spark, reweighting the premise without sermon. The communal rising is ambiguous—liberation or target—leaving resonant after-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is pyrotechnic: percussive diction, rhythmic chant, sensory precision. POV stays locked to Sparrow’s trained perception—he sees “blossoms of silver willow” where others see noise. No head-hop; the final hush is filtered through his ears, not the crowd’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet incandescent: “bloom,” “thump,” “sizzling light.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances craft or stakes. Occasional elevated lyricism (“stitch the sky back together”) is earned by context and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fireworks-as-rebellion trope is refreshed by treating the display as linguistic—chemical sentences answering a mosaic text. Specificity of compounds and the rag’s tactile history make the premise singular. Risk: quiet ending without cheer, trusting image over spectacle.</comment>
