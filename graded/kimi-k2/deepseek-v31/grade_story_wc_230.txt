<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—rational forager vs. desperate empath—are embodied in the orchard beats; her involuntary truth-telling forces a public confession of doubt that tightens the cost of using the eye. The final choice to wield the relic as a trowel, not a crutch, is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible psychic cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: descent because of psychic pain → discovery of eye → recognition of trap → repurposing eye as tool. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—she accepts the smuggler’s fear as a manageable mono-din, foreclosing the fantasy of pure silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-lashed ravine and wind-whipped trees act as externalized empathic static, constraining movement and mirroring internal pressure; the orchard’s glass eye burial site supplies the decisive object. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elara’s need for relief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety—tightens once when the eye’s seductive mono-din is weighed against self-theft. Escalation is causal: each gust of shared anguish narrows her options until she chooses partial occlusion over surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stolen vs. cultivated safety emerges from concrete choices, not statement. The final image of using the eye as a trowel reweights the premise: safety is not found but built, with the smuggler’s fear as mortar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly brittle—matching a rational mind under siege. Syntax tightens under storm pressure; involuntary truths erupt with clipped candor. No POV drift; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; figurative language (“raw nerve,” “fractured grace”) is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Rhythm accelerates with wind and revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus world and orchard of occluding fruit feel freshly synthesized; the glass eye as bottled consciousness is a non-obvious cure that complicates rather than solves. Risky inversion of silence-as-theft lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
