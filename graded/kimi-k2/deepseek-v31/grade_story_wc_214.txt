<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"silent, burning joy of a million small journeys" anchors empathy—but motivations shift from curiosity to mystical compulsion without friction visible on the page, slightly flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Charged Poise: AI and human wordless union reconfigures station’s purpose with undeniable weight; “Ah” crystallizes before/after without tidy mechanics. Causal linkage holds—glass enables empathy which invites AI witness—cost is the perpetual witnessing itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Station is sensuously rendered—metal “mirror finish” under starlight and cosmic hush—but micro-setting’s most potent charge is the lantern glass; removal would blunt the final constraint, so meets gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake reframes observation: from tracking to witnessing; tension tightens when AI threatens quarantine, forcing a choice of sharing rather than hiding—cost is human surrender of private understanding to machine. escalation is single, meaningful, legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically—“finding strength in vulnerability” lived through meteors’ arcs and Orion’s trembling palms; final shared “Ah” reweights knowledge without pronouncement, staying clear of meta commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is hushed, cosmic, rhythmic—prose modulates to breathless pulse during meteor influx; perceptual texture is consistent and character-tuned (“tapestry of infinite black” filtered through janitor’s humble awe).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>No scaffold, steady density except minor near-repetition (“silent” used three times close); rhythm varies naturally; figurative choices enhance clarity rather than clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Cosmic custodian+ancient lantern glass fusion is fresh, avoids genre cliché; the witness-to-vulnerability angle feels inevitable only in hindsight—specific synthesis, not checklist.</comment>
