<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict—her struggle to transform “always” from Leo to the land—is embodied and specific. The final micro-choice (scattering the ash) renounces the love path and commits to custodial endurance, ringing the “cost with felt ambiguity” bell. The dully aching retrospective interiority tilts toward psychologizing rather than embodied immediacy at two beats, capping this at 8.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: she lets the ash go, integrating the past rather than erasing it, foreclosing the romance path. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of vineyard parallels reframing memory. Cost is legible: the remnant “always” literally leaves her hand and becomes compost. One spatial anchor held to 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Amber Pavilion’s “translucent panels that glow like a captive sunset,” the cold ripe fruit, and ash caught on “a breeze that smelled of earth” all charge the final image. Setting actively mirrors and constrains Elara’s stance—the vineyard demands patient return rather than frantic bloom. Object as micro-setting—the burned edge—anchors closure and avoids static postcarding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is alignment of self with impermanent labor of the vineyard vs the burned promise. Pressure tightens once: the act of re-reading the letter triggers a single deepening reframing, not new reversals. Agency drives the escalation; cost is letting go of the physical relic. No external antagonist—internal mismatch is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “some loves cultivate soul-soil” emerges implicitly through pruning metaphor and vineyard cycles; not sermonized. Final scatter becomes a quiet Conceptual Repricing—past love is compost, not failure, a non-moral answer to mismatched rhythms. Lack of overt counter-reading slightly softens top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is precise: “gnarled vines, their leaves aflame,” “crisp air, silver and shadow.” Rhythm accelerates under stress: single syllables at climax (“ash…carried away”) before longer reflection. No head-hop, no dialogue clumsiness. One compressed interior monologue is clean and earns its keep.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely controlled; occasional poetic lattice (“the promise was not broken, but transformed, its meaning refined by heat of failure”) threatens overwriting but recovers. No loops or synonyms stall momentum. Punctuation and tense stay stable. Dock 0.1 for “ghost of a memory tugging at her” cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Transmutes break-up trope via vineyard ecology—renewal via rot, not denial. Vocabulary, rhythm, and metaphor feel specific to this vineyard speaker. The synthesis of “always” memo and grape cycle is non-obvious yet inevitable. Skims the top band risk by playing safely within lyrical realism rather than formal daring.</comment>
