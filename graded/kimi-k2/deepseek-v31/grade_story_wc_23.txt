<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the pain was a fuel”), her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. let go) act simultaneously in scene, and her final renunciation—choosing to stay and die after sending the archive—carries visible cost. The bronze censer foot anchors memory and choice, but the voice drifts toward abstract “geography of loss” phrasing that edges into label-speak, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes a tomb while the archive escapes, the cost felt in the dying lights and Elara’s solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final cadence shift in darkness. No causality breaks; every object and action threads cleanly to the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is rendered with tactile specificity—“great hydraulic heart silenced,” “ghostly blue glow,” “grated floor”—and the bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains the final build. Spatial choreography is coherent; the frozen dish and emergency power limits are consistently observed. A hairline slip: “Earthlight reflected off a small, heavy object” momentarily floats the censer in white-room space before the workbench anchors it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve human memory against total loss—is signaled early and tightens through each beat: hydraulics fail → midnight call → build or surrender → final beam. The protagonist’s agency drives every escalation; coincidence never rescues. The cost—her life, the station’s death—is legible in the dying console lights.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges organically from action and image; the bronze censer foot’s shift from cold comfort to warm anchor reweights loss into legacy without moralizing. Final darkness offers a resonant, non-literal answer: extinction and transmission coexist. One soft echo—“monument to a dying dream”—leans toward abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, textured, and consistent—compressed diction under pressure (“scraps of conduit, spare focusing crystals”) and lyrical elongation in reflection. POV remains tightly bound to Elara’s perception; no head-hopping. The midnight call’s static-crack voice is differentiated from her interior cadence. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt a profound peace”) slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“bleeding atmosphere,” “silent scream.” One scaffold loop: “She wasn’t just sending data; she was sending a soul” restates the prior sentence’s implication. Otherwise clean, with no artifacts touching the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The reverse-migration premise—sending culture outward as Earth dies—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The bronze censer foot repurposed as broadcast anchor transforms a familiar memento into a starship heart. Risky compression of timeline and lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
