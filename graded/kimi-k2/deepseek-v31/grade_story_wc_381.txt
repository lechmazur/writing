<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aeliana’s interiority is precise and embodied; every fold of the wing is a micro-choice under rising stakes. The final “peace-pour” renunciation earns a visible cost: world silence at expense of personal strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: prophecy murmur → silent mapping → breath-timed folding → unraveled knot, all held under Accumulative lens. Closure lands on-page with the wing returning to still paper as earned hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Smoothed hush made tactile: stone hums dim, leaves stop rustling, crane’s glow dims. Environment as tool constrains summoner’s every inhalation; final quiet is reweighted via place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mute the prophecy—escalates steadily without antagonist: each silent exhalation narrows her stamina margin; the tightening climaxes when her will must outweigh cosmic frequency.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: silence as both weapon and wound. Subtext in the brook’s counter-rhythm and wing’s half-rise; no moralizing, only felt cost etched in paper’s glow fading away.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrid, deliberate cadence matches tranquil but implacable focus. Free indirect style clean; “gurgling water” and “smoothed hush” anchor unique perceptual signature without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished, no loops, high density: every image folds forward (“paper the color of moonlight” immediately links to celestial stakes). Occasional elevated diction is earned by ritual context.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar fantasy arc of prophecy-hushing re-mixed through paper engineering; fresh inversion uses silence instead of counterspell. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>
