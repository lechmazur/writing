<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interior wants versus needs are sharply drawn; embodied impatience ("her sleeve brushed a mature leaf") triggers the climax beat. The final renunciation—breathing the rot—makes the cost of her flaw visceral. Reflection is capped at ~25% of word-count and each memory cue tilts the present stance. Micro-choice lineage (the doodles) reweights her tactics and earns Earned Stasis at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scent’s assault reframes “serenity within motion” as living rot, paid in one sustained gag reflex. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density intensifies via the seed’s slow inevitability until the plant releases its cost in the final image. No teleporting props; causality intact. Orientation anchors are early and sufficient (sunset window in first paragraph).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vine-bridge canopy is tactile and spatially coherent. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through olfac POV bias: “wildflower hush” versus “pungent memory.” Only the hut’s limited micro-setting constrains final choices—sunshift access to pot—but environment does not rewire tactics, so remains just below 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</degree><comment>Dominant stake—stillness at the heart of decay—is introduced on page-one and escalated through the plant’s slow reveal. Pressure tightens when the bloom preemptively punishes her impatience; the scent assault is the earned reversal that collapses her sterile-control option. Cost is odor-induced nausea—visible, body-bound, on-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: decay-as-purification reframed from abstract wish to lived stink. Avoids sermonizing; the final image (accepting rot as peace) avoids tidy moral tags. One subtle recurrence (the doodled “patience”) that gains new significance retroactively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrid, compressed sentences with slight poetic inversion teach pattern early (“woven into the canopy by bridges of living vine”). Perceptual signature is distinct: scent hierarchy overrides visual detail. Register drift minimal; cadence varies with scene heat. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive, information-dense (“olfactorily sensitive,” “preemptive burst of its infamous scent”). Near-caps: one minor paraphrase loop—repeating “serenity within motion” concept three times across adjacent sentences—applies only a hairline penalty as it sits just pre-climax. Otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: inheritance doodles as cryptic coaching rewrites corpse-flower trope into quiet family ritual. Not a checklist transplant. Final reprise of the doodled leaf as lived instruction feels inevitable rather than gimmick. Slight loss for derivative flower-of-death premise, but local transformation outweighs.</comment>
