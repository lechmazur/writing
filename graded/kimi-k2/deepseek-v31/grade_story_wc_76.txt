<comment>Eliran’s interiority is audibly unique—his self-invented clockworks literalise his will to rewind destiny; the moment he seats the stone and realises the mechanism reverses causality itself shows a decisive, cost-burdened stance that forecloses life as-is. His hunger to outrun fate is embodied in oil-stained fingers and frantic microadjustments, so flaws (hubris, isolation) visibly ramify under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands irrevocably: Eliran at the unpromised seabed, oxygen leaking from the antediluvian past, decisively changed. The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern—subtractive light gradually pulling the past toward him—ending in a Resonant Reconfiguration whose conceptual cost (a world empty of life) is felt on the final page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Counter-clockwise brass housings and salt-eaten lighthouse are rendered through tactile POV tools; the hunger stone’s subtractive radiance is keystone to both atmosphere and climax, charging the final negative daylit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Tension escalates as each click of reversed gears constricts options, culminating in the lethal rewind of tide and oxygen—stakes pivot on Eliran’s specific, irreversible choice to start the mechanism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Bleak exhilaration of defiance against predestination forms a coherent subtext, crystallising into the dread realisation that stepping beyond fate equals erasing the world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Focalisation is tight, diction skewed to clock-smith’s lexicon; sentences accelerate under rising tension, never head-hopping. The rhythm collapses from frantic to hollowed truth as the last light retracts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but densely tightened; figurative language always advances the reversal concept and avoids loops. Final image of “negative brilliance” anchors with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Time-reversal via counter-clock yoyo and hunger stone feels fresh, inevitable, and charged—risky inversion grounded in anatomised mechanics makes a bleak edifice of invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Eliran’s every micro-choice—dissecting yoyo, enthroning the stone—drives the causal charge toward the sea’s erasure; without him the universe lacks its rewind current.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Hunger stone handled in Setup (carving), Mid (mounting), Payoff (inverted glow devouring life); its admonition “weine” is reweighted when Eliran transmutes its warning into actionable rejection of fate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Latent radiance is no theme emblem; it thrum-glows and reverses daylight itself, directly engineering the stakes of a world unborn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Neatly inventive trait constrains material choice (brass, muscle, counter-gears) and exacts real trade-off every time Eliran invents beyond sane limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Initiate mechanism action triggers irreversible retro-causality; swap it and the world ending vanishes. Non-fungible pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Reverse-engineering yoyo mechanics are sensical pressure throughout—spin tension, yo-yo return, mirrored in gear ratios. Failure would collapse the working logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse provides cracked lantern room and sea-spray optics that constrain lighting and accessibility, though its rock island could be any wind-scoured coast without structural rupture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Low-tide exposition is live timer: marsh mud yields the stone, then sea re-inhalation threatens existence; timeframe quickens as chronology unspools past sunlight beyond memory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vivid friction: hunger to transcend fate clashes with self-destruction as oxygen thins—desire dramatised via frantic clockwork and final hollow breath of earth before life existed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Bleak exhilaration modulates seamlessly from gleeful invention to end-of-all-life silence, culminating in charged poise of barren seabed under empty sun.</comment>
