<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the contradictory pull between grief and the need to “harvest lessons” is dramatized in her micro-choice to carve the cupped-hand curve. The final renunciation—letting the kettle’s click end the session—earns its cost because the prior beats have shown how precious each second of allowed ache is. No slips touch closure, but the widow’s competence edges toward near-perfect emotional calibration, keeping her just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carved hand reconfigures absence into a portable vessel of safety, and the kettle’s click seals the moment with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (rain, steam, wood grain) tightens the emotional density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the phrase “crystallized time” is slightly abstract, but it is paid off by the kettle’s audible limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skylight loft, ash blank, and kettle form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the kettle’s hiss is the literal clock, the loft’s isolation enables controlled grief, the blank becomes the vessel. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (linseed oil, sawdust ghosts). The rain-beaded glass returns in the final image, recharging the earlier grey murmur into refracted light. Missing the 9+ gate only because the loft itself does not physically impede or enable the carving act beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contain grief within art—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: the shift from “monument to the beast” to the negative-space hand narrows options and raises emotional cost. Agency is renunciation: she stops when the kettle clicks, paying the price of an unfinished surface to preserve the lesson. Cost is visible in the rough wood and the deliberate cessation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love’s quiet architecture outlasts loss. The cupped-hand motif reweights the “here and gone” concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in the kettle’s mundane finality and the rough, unfinished carving—an earned, non-literal answer. No thematic drift; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “smelling of linseed oil and the ghosts of sawdust” is character-specific perception. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences for memory, clipped fragments during carving. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. One minor register lift—“crystallized time”—but the pattern is taught early enough to remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“grain like a map of forgotten rivers.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s syntactic hush mirrors the rust-hued peace. A single filter verb cluster (“began its low, rumbling hiss”) is justified by the kettle’s personification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The widow-carver who turns absence into a hand-shaped hollow is a fresh angle on grief art. The kettle-as-clock device is simple yet non-obvious, transforming a domestic object into existential timer. Specificity of craft (gouge choice, ash grain) grounds the premise. Risk is quiet but coherent; no derivative echoes.</comment>
