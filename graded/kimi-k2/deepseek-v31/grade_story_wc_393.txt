<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vale’s guilt and desire to honor the dead prisoner are clear, but the interior contradiction—his helplessness versus his pastoral duty—stays mostly summary. Liam’s “aptly deliberate” curiosity is shown once in gesture, yet never complicates his choice to help; the pivot arm repair is Liam’s mechanical act, not Vale’s moral one. The final tearful gasp registers, but the cost lands on Liam’s epiphany more than Vale’s. Still, the brass heart’s beating does reconfigure Vale’s stance toward redemption, so the arc is earned, if thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causality: Vale brings the heart → Liam diagnoses → sunbeam triggers beat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mechanical pulse reframes “apology into action” with felt cost (the prisoner’s life already spent). No orientation drift; the shop, storm, and sunbeam are anchored early. One tightening beat—bent pivot arm—suffices. Lens is Causal; every beat is legible under because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique shop is vivid—lemon polish, disemboweled music boxes, single bulb—yet it never constrains choice; it’s atmosphere more than obstacle. Micro-setting of brass heart-as-body works better: its bent pivot arm literally blocks motion. Sunbeam through storm glass is a charged final image that reweights the heart’s glow. Meets 9+ gate only on the heart-as-object, not the shop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Vale fulfill the prisoner’s dying wish? Pressure rises once—diagnosis reveals a single, fixable flaw. Cost is the prisoner’s life already gone and Vale’s lingering inadequacy. Agency is mostly Liam’s; Vale watches, so the tightening is vicarious. Still, the beat narrows options to “repair or abandon,” and the repair succeeds with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of earned redemption emerges through the heart’s literal ticking: “redemption is not granted but a relentless action.” No moralizing speech; the image does the work. Subtext in Liam’s whispered “why?” and Vale’s silence carries doubt and guilt. Final sunbeam reweights the premise without sermon. Complexity lingers—was the prisoner redeemed or merely mechanical?—avoiding tidy answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-limited drifts gently between Vale’s filtered perception and Liam’s tactile precision; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled—“vibrant hush,” “microscopic angels”—with purposeful rhythm. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (“why?”). No register drift. Distinct perceptual signatures: Vale notices moral weight, Liam notices gears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional lyrical lift (“dust motes… danced like microscopic angels”) stays within POV. No loops, no scaffold. Strong verbs—“lanced,” “thrum-thump”—propel the final beat. One minor filter-verb cluster (“Father Vale did not smile”) but not under pressure. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Clockwork heart as proxy for contrition is fresh, not gimmicky. The repair-as-redemption metaphor is grounded in watchmaker backstory and single bent pivot arm. Risk taken: no antagonist, no twist, just quiet illumination. Specificity of antique-music-box shop and brass heart resists generic swap. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
