<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“hands, pale as moonstone”), her contradictory impulses (grief vs duty) act simultaneously, and the final renunciation of the bead carries visible cost. The ghost bride’s pressure is felt but remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead transfer reweights the orchard’s life/death polarity and releases the ghost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each vision shard tightens emotional density toward the final golden wave. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s crystalline panes and silver-barked tree are tactile constraints that guide Elara’s search and charge the final shoot. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; the “starless night” becomes star-filled only after the release, a causal environmental shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—settle the debt or lose the orchard—is signaled early and tightened by each ghostly cameo. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the ghost’s dissolution and Elara’s solitary future. One meaningful deepening suffices under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of unlived life vs cyclical renewal emerges from the serpent bead and the orchard’s fruit, never stated outright. Final image of the silver shoot offers a non-literal answer: endings are beginnings, but at a price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “petrichor and paradox” teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s synesthetic noticing (“peaches that smelled of tears”) never wavers. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent and earned. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift. Final chime is a felt sonic image, not a cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard and emotion-ripened fruit feel fresh; the ghost-bride trope is inverted into a wistful guide rather than horror. The bead’s serpent eternity motif reappears with reweighted meaning, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
