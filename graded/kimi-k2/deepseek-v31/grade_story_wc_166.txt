<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between exile-as-punishment and exile-as-vantage crystallizes in the final beat. Motive (cosmic verse on skin) drives every micro-choice; pain anchors her in scene. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Final renunciation of muted world is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tattoo’s completion turns exile into chosen vantage, cost etched in pain and moonstone. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of symbols and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost legible in “she was no longer just a woman in a garden.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Twilight garden, star-fed blooms, obsidian air—all constrain silence and timing of the ritual. Micro-setting (her thigh as canvas) functions as charged object. Final gleam of moonstone in skin reconfigures the cosmos under the same sky. Sensory selection tightens under pain, never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: reclaim erased past through forbidden art. Escalation is accretive—each puncture deepens commitment and pain. No external reversals; pressure is coherent internal tide. Final tightening: moonstone droplet locks the dance forever, foreclosing return to sterile world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through image and action, never stated. Spiral galaxy on skin becomes non-literal answer: cosmos reclaims its own. Ambiguity lingers—rebellion or surrender?—without confusion. Final gleam reweights every prior absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters cosmos through dancer’s kinesthetic sense. Syntax mirrors tidal rhythm; no head-hop. Compression taught early (“liquid silence”) and paid off in closure. Register consistent, elevated but plausible for exiled artist-priest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined to pattern. Micro-crystalline detail (“single, potent dust speck”) carries outsized weight. Rhythm accelerates with pain, breathes at galaxy completion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—tattoo as rebellion, exile—are transfigured by tide-dancer cosmology and moonstone alchemy. Specificity of forbidden tide-language etched in skin feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds; closure legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
