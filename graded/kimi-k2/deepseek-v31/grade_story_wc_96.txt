<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s molting trait is vivid early, but the monthly cadence is asserted rather than dramatized; the “repairman” persona is shown only through book-mending, not tested under pressure. Elara’s interiority is sketched via gesture, yet her institutional weariness remains generic. The final molt-as-evolution lands cleanly, but the cost is more stated than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single-scene structure with one transition (library → prison) is clean; causality holds. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dawn image crystallizes a new stance without yet paying the price. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The poem-and-key reveal is a tidy micro-turn that reconfigures options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The rusted library’s ribs and moonlit dome are tactile and atmospheric, constraining their clandestine work. Spatial choreography is coherent; the coffee tin’s seam is a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory economy favors wet paper and iron, anchoring tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—smuggle forbidden books—emerges mid-story and tightens once. Agency is shared: Elara’s access, Silas’s scavenging. One credible loss: the risk of discovery is implied but not dramatized on-page. The final crate’s readiness is a deepening that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “beauty from anarchy” emerges through salvaged books and covert resistance; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the silent sorting and the flower inscription. Final image of the tin “full of scraps” reweights the premise: creation born from secrecy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Silas; perceptual signature is poet-tinged (“luminous fracture,” “skeletal web”). Syntax modulates with moonlight cadence. Dialogue is spare but purposeful; Elara’s hushed tremor carries subtext. No head-hopping.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; sentence openings vary. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“moon-dust,” “cathedral”) and never muddles action. One minor register drift—“husk of a friendship”—leans abstract but doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The vagrant-poet-who-molts is fresh, yet the prison-library smuggling arc feels familiar; specificity of Whitman and flower inscriptions lifts it. The coffee-tin reveal is a non-obvious pivot. Risk is moderate—quiet resistance rather than spectacle—but coherent.</comment>
