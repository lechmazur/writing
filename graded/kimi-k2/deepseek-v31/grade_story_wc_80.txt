<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses—Ansel’s stoic self-image versus raw sensitivity—drives every action from boot-squelching wade to tremor when Elara appears. Each micro-choice (stone sealed, ink offered) crystallizes hierarchy of values: records over reputation, shared memory over solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: desire to preserve > retrieval > collaborative deposit. Closure beat reconfigures meaning—“library, not tomb”—with conceptual cost: the past is now open public trust, no longer private curation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Moonlit water, brass-and-glass inkwell, slurp of boots through tide—all tactile anchors. Submerged pavilion functions as both spatial and psychic chamber that constrains the final collaborative choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—a belief in the salvability of loss—tightens once: solitary archive threatened by witness becomes consensual stewardship with Elara. No further escalation needed; the cost (loss of curator solitude) is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges through action: memory as active civic underpinning. The collaborative act transforms “absence” from erosion to community. Final image—“quiet devoted librarians”—reweights loss into custodianship without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Lyrical free-indirect voice mirrors Ansel’s meticulous melancholy; every sentence bears his perceptual signature. Compression and patterned repetition (“interlaced absence”) are taught early and reprise in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the hushed blaze” “sea sucking at his boots” create read-aloud rhythm. No filter-verb loops or mixed metaphor. High information per line advances character, object, atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: heritage preservation as performance-art archaeology set in drowned folly. Transforms familiar “loss of place” trope into literal foundation repair with living ink. Risk choices heighten intimacy without gimmick.</comment>
