<comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—fingertips brushing sun-warm stone, a “thrilling sense of discovery”—yet motivation slips slightly abstract on first arrival, and the final resolve feels more stated than earned through observable contradiction. Still, her embodied dread among her own bones and the cost of accepting the shadow as gnomon give the decision visible personal freight.</comment>

<comment>The drive lens is accumulative/textural; pressure builds through pattern of increasing sensory density until the realization that the broken branch has completed the sundial. Closure—Elara clearing the space and stepping into the cycle—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with understated, irrefutable cost: belonging demands inhabiting an unbreakable continuity. Orientation is early and clean after first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting precision is superb: roots threaded through femurs, cool dust “sweet” with decay. The orchard itself constrains every action—roots resist excavation, a branch reasserts the timekeeper’s role—charging the final image so the environment literally speaks. Spatial choreography and sensory layering are vivid without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring faith in her blood line through physical communion—tightens from journal hint to tactile excavation. One escalation only yet effective: collapse forced nature to stand in for missing technology, reweighting every prior root pulled. Cost is visceral yet understated; reader feels the irrevocable membership.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited interruption quietly reframed into inherited interweaving emerges from image, gesture and silence rather than statement. No overt moral—simply the fig’s shadow now anchoring generations in present light. Subtle and resonant but at one moment summary (“make it speak”) edges too close to thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Narrative texture is controlled and lyrical: filtered through tactile noticing and selective sensory bias. One line risks expository smoothing—“she understood her journey was also incomplete”—but rhythmic compression elsewhere keeps voice coherent. Distinct perceptual signature holds across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose balances lush precision with momentum; clauses braid cleanly, no redundancy among bones or roots. Occasional elevated diction (“haunting fusion,” “spectacular”) flirts with overwriting yet reads as momentary flare rather than cumulative drag. Final image concise and recharges prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Conceptual synthesis—cemetery as functioning sundial, ancestor as tree shadow—feels simultaneously invented & inevitable. A minor echo of island-return trope muted by granular specificity of olive roots knitting the skeletal lattice. Fresh angle anchored in tactile world logic.</question>
