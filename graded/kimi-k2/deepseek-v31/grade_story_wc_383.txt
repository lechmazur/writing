<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. keeper of impossible flora—drives every micro-choice; the shell’s grip and her tremor embody the cost. The final “Live” lands as earned renunciation of denial, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-scene arc from discovery to integration; causal chain (shell→Archive→memory flood→stance shift) is airtight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: grief is re-housed, not erased, with visible dawn-light cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden’s velvet dusk and Archive’s stone plinth are tactile constraints; the shell’s phosphorescence becomes the literal light source for the climax. Spatial choreography holds as Elara moves boot-to-plinth without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep memory sealed—tightens with each pulse of the shell; the Archive’s resonance forces the irreversible trade-off. Cost is the felt chill of seawater and the audible “Live,” not abstract loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living archive emerges through the shell’s song and the garden’s breathing petals; no moralizing, only the re-weighted understanding that preservation ≠ imprisonment. Subtext in the brother’s single whispered word.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression (“tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve”) is consistent and taught early; POV remains tight third-person with no leakage. Syntax mirrors Elara’s wary cadence, then opens at the dawn release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work without clutter. Only minor filter slips (“seemed to mourn”) keep it from 9.0; no loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-memory garden trope is re-cast through resonance physics and tactile flora; the shell-lighthouse linkage feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but it pays off.</comment>
