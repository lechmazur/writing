<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s “cautiously hopeful” skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—cross-referencing charts, repurposing the array—culminating in the deliberate broadcast that costs her professional integrity. The contradiction between wonder and suspicion is dramatized, not labeled, and the final slump shows earned fatigue. Leo is functional but thin; his single beat of discovery serves the plot more than relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal → discovery of sub-carrier → counter-broadcast → immediate crowd de-escalation. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—Aris’s violation of protocol and the station’s re-purposing. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One micro-turn (hidden message) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The radio station’s clutter—ozone, coffee, repurposed consoles—grounds every action; the charts evolve from maps of curiosity to tools of war. Micro-setting (sub-woofers in the concert hall) becomes the tactical pivot. Sensory detail is selective and urgent, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the community from covert manipulation—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as the crowd forms. The tightening beat is the decision to weaponize the array; cost is the ethical breach and physical exhaustion. Pressure is coherent and causally driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of manipulated wonder emerges through the elegant math vs. subliminal poison duality; no explicit moralizing. The final silence reweights the charts from answers to “endless, silent questions,” a resonant reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet haunted—“ethereal grit” rendered in phrases like “marriage of the sublime wonder… and grim determination.” Syntax tightens under pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (Leo’s “It’s subsonic”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is sparing and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) fits Aris’s academic lens. Rhythm accelerates during the broadcast sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inversion of first-contact wonder into psychological warfare feels fresh; the sub-carrier twist is set up and paid off. Specificity of the radio-station milieu and the sonic counter-attack grounds the concept. Risky ethical stance—sabotage as defense—is fully committed to.</comment>
