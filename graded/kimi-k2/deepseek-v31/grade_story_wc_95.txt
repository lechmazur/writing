<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Valerius’s mechanical arm and Elara’s diplomatic fierceness are embodied through precise micro-choices—his inhuman pivot, her 45° guard—yet the interior contradiction between shared goal and adversarial stance is only implied, not dramatized in real time. The final salute and joint retrieval earn a partnership shift with visible cost (her foil clatters, his arm points), but the emotional layering feels slightly under-pressured for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each blade angle is a because/therefore variable narrowing to the 45° solution. Closure is a decisive change—the green pane opens—paid for by the controlled violence of the duel; cost is legible in the echoing clatter and their shift from opponents to partners. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook murmur, and half-painted sundial are selective, tactile, and finally causal: the sundial’s arcs literally guide Valerius’s pointing arm to the hidden pane. Micro-setting (the floor’s flagstones, the tinted glass) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and sound under the crystalline pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“turn questions into destinations”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened through each geometric lunge until the 45° guard forecloses alternatives. Cost is the violence enacted upon a collaborator; the library’s promise is earned, not given. Escalation is causal and single-threaded, sufficient for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-combat emerges from the duel’s silent geometry; no explicit statement mars the close. The final image of the book in Elara’s gentle hands reweights the prior violence into collaborative discovery. Ambiguity lingers: what knowledge costs them next remains unspoken yet felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly elevated, fitting a philosopher-mechanic; perceptual signature shows in “delicate whir” and “diplomatically fierce.” Rhythm modulates with action—short percussive clauses during lunges, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Valerius’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or tactic. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“violent poetry,” “dignified chaos.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final line’s hush lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fencing-as-cipher and duel-as-dialogue synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, inevitable mechanism. The mechanical arm and antique needle card feel specific, not ornamental; removing either would collapse the logic. Risky conceit executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
