<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—empirical skeptic vs synesthetic seeker—drives every beat; the shift from observer to participant is embodied in the warming ring and the taste of “sunlight on lavender.” Cost is felt: he forfeits detached analysis for communal stewardship. Minor slip: the woman’s speech edges toward thematic echo, blunting full individuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass re-orients from place to purpose, crystallizing Kael’s irrevocable choice to join. Causal chain holds—each beat (needle twitch, taste convergence, descent) tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is explicit in the final “taste of the future, and sweetly of the past.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora are not backdrop; their scent and light constrain Kael’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting of the vibrating ring functions as tactile terrain. One minor drift: “valleys that only voted in twilight” is vivid but momentarily disorients before re-anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why weather is carried—tightens when the golden-calm woman reveals the cost of stewardship. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The price is legible: Kael abandons solitary certainty for collective guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as ecological duty. Subtext in taste and compass avoids moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without a sermon. One soft line—“we are the memory”—leans toward echo, but the embodied cost rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Voice is synesthetic, skeptical, and lyrically compressed; perceptual signature distinct in “taste of ozone and burnt metal.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during descent, luminous elongation at closure. No POV leakage; dialogue minimal but breeze-gentle, fitting the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory data and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) is earned by context and pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Premise fuses climate grief with synesthetic stewardship; the compass-as-purpose is a fresh inversion of navigation tropes. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative.</comment>
