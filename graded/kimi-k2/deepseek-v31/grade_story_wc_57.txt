<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s infinitely-patient, reflective interior convincingly spirals into the active decoding move; the fulgurite lens moment crystallises both her flaw (spurned action) and earned cost. Missing only a more fraught micro-choice under intensifying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the memory-harvest scene reconfigures the entire conceptual frame (secret weavers = concrete knot-scribes); causal link from fulgurite to final POV image flawless. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to the quiet, charged ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Golden dock under snow functions as micro-setting that melts/re-freezes, steering tactile choices; fulgurite and rope fibers become texture-environment. Fog as oceanic hush deepens closure without over-describing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent extinction of knot-memory—escalates via decoding constraints; each twist lopping a live option. Causality intact: Hemlock’s knot rewords destiny, not deus-ex-fog.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “to preserve ancient methods” is reweighted when Elara realises *preservation is creation*, paying thematic cost (she becomes scribe, not merely archivist).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Detached, quietly relentless voice sustains oceanic-hush cadence under pressure; fulgurite distortion lens is revealed via character filter, no POV drift. Distinct rhythmic control in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high-density sentences that crunch light/time/memory into lived texture; syntax accelerates under fog’s quiet without purple overwrites. Read-aloud rhythm flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Knot-reader premise is fresh, non-promised twist; mythic “weaver” concept transmuted into artisan scribe felt specific to this voice. Missing one deeper inflection to top tier.</comment>
