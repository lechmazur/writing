<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn’s cheerful gloom is embodied in whistling amid despair, but interior contradiction is mostly summarized; the final choice to document the cataclysm is earned yet stated more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed reveals the landslide of forgetting, reweighting Finn’s task. Causal chain holds—foam gaps → seed → valley truth—though the seed’s arrival is lightly motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The iridescent geode and crater glass are vivid and selective; the glass sheet literally displays the final truth, constraining the closure image. Spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why memories vanish—tightens when the seed exposes the landslide. One decisive intensification occurs; cost is the knowledge that paths are forever buried, felt in Finn’s resolve to record the loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s fragility emerges through the seed’s revelation rather than statement; the final image of documenting absence offers resonant, non-moralizing weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with crystalline diction matching the geode setting; perceptual signature is consistent, no head-hop. Compression in the seed-vision sequence is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional poetic layering (“kaleidoscope of captured light”) is purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sea-foam recollectionist and memory-anchoring seed are fresh syntheses; the landslide of forgetting reconfigures a familiar loss trope. Specificity and risk feel organic, not gimmicky.</comment>
