<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fix is well-delineated—curious posture and bell obsession collide in action (Resonator tuning, kaleidoscope pivot). Interiority is embodied (physically leaning over rails, tasting acid fumes) rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands hard: kaleidoscope-filtered static becomes cosmic code, purity injected, horizon softens. Causal chain intact (arrow → static → pattern → injection → sea change). Cost paid pure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Acid sea and grinding workshop are pressure sources, not wallpaper: gears literally push them ahead of decay, acidic scent alters crew posture. Setting constrains tactics and feeds the frequency hunt.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes narrow from “find a bell tone” to “rewrite the world’s code”; each tighter lens raises physical risk plus existential cost. Evolution itself is placed under decision ethical weight.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces organically: technology as prayer, yearning as algorithm; final note of “purity” reconfigures commodified decay into faint sweetness without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is specific—brass, reeds, corrosive fumes rendered through tactile sensorium. Kaleidoscope’s “irreverent awe” phrase recurs at close, tightening tone under pressure without self-repeat.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Percussion-like rhythm of whirring machinery and maritime phrasing propel without loop; condensed metaphor (“cosmic hiccup”) cuts florid risk without deflating grandeur.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Nobody writes the world’s yearning algorithm through a child’s toy and acid-sea residency; synthesis feels inevitable on second read yet surprisingly fresh.</comment>
