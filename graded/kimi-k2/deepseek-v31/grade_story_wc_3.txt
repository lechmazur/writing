<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris’s grief-driven need to decode transition physics is clear and embodied; the micro-choice to release the seed crystallizes his shift from control to acceptance. Interiority is specific, though the “kindly methodical” trait is more asserted than tested. The cost—surrender of certainty—lands quietly but tangibly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s release triggers both the carrier-wave ping and the green shoot, proving the physics of surrender. Causal lens holds; every beat flows from Aris’s attempt to force → choice to release. Cost is felt in the ache now “at touching distance.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magnetic Arbor is sketched with spare, tactile strokes—“ironwood bones,” “clouds swirling below”—and the bench-edge micro-setting constrains the final act. Sensory hierarchy fits a scholar’s gaze. World rules stay consistent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand transition to reach Elara—tightens when decoding fails and the seed refuses force. The single reversal (release vs. command) narrows options and carries visible emotional cost. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of surrender vs. control emerges organically from cuneiform ambiguity and seed refusal; the final image of the shoot reframes grief as living framework. No moralizing—resonance is carried by image and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is calm, precise, slightly archaic—befitting a cuneiform scholar—yet modulates under pressure (“aching pressure,” “terrifying faith”). No dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“baked-earth poetry”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift toward the lyrical is voice-motivated and controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of ancient cuneiform and quantum transition feels fresh; the seed-as-comprehension trope is reweighted by its refusal to obey force. Specificity of the Arbor and the ferryman fragment anchors the concept. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
