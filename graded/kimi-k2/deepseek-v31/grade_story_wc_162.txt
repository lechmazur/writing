<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tracing the wood grain to decode the logbook is a precise, embodied micro-choice that reveals both intellect and grief. The contradiction between her slight frame and “tempered-steel” will is shown, not told, and it drives her to cross the final threshold. The only limit is that her father remains off-page; the relationship pressure is therefore abstract, capping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern accretion (logbook, grain, butterfly) tightens until the final image reweights the entire premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara steps into the memory-storm and emerges with a charged poise, the cost being the irreversible knowledge that her father is trapped in that moment. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Terrace is rendered with selective sensory strokes—“solidified air” railings, “diamond-paned” rooms—each detail constrains navigation and mood. The single solid desk anchors the scene spatially and symbolically. The environment literally shifts under Elara’s feet, forcing her final choice; the monarch butterfly at the climax is both setting and fulcrum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the sacred thresholds—escalates as Elara deciphers the logbook and realizes the thresholds are temporal scars. One decisive tightening occurs when she chooses to cross the shimmering arch, trading safety for knowledge. The cost is the sensory assault of the memory-storm and the irreversible recognition of her father’s entrapment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of “necessary distances” emerges organically from the logbook’s weather code, the wood grain’s turbulence, and the butterfly’s lethal proximity. No moral is stated; the final image of fragile wings holding the sky in balance reweights the entire premise. The ambiguity—whether understanding heals or dooms—lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose has a crystalline, hushed texture that modulates into metallic roar at the climax, mirroring Elara’s perceptual arc. Compression is purposeful—“featherly determined” condenses physique and will in two words. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight to Elara, and the lyric elisions are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are lean yet luminous—“the paper crackling like a dry throat” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each line advances knowledge or atmosphere. A single mixed metaphor—“god’s fist”—is brief enough to avoid muddle. Rhythm accelerates into the memory-storm and subsides into crystalline silence, matching the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Butterfly Effect as literal monarch butterfly on a cockpit window is a fresh, non-obvious image that feels inevitable in hindsight. The Drifting Prism Terrace as a memory-map of consequence is a bold structural risk that pays off. Specificity—wood grain as meteorological code—anchors the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
