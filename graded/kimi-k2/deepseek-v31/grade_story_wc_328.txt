<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s shift from detached cataloguer to empathetic participant is embodied in the micro-choice to hurl the arrowhead; the contradiction between “tool of division” and “place that understands only connection” crystallizes her arc. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. The cost—renouncing her foundation’s mandate—is legible in the final silence and laughter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrowhead becomes a node, the Changed laugh, and Aris’s stance is irreversibly altered. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each confession thickens the pattern until the single decisive intensification. Cost is visible in the forfeiture of her original mission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden’s “gravitationally playful” physics directly constrains the climax: the arrowhead orbits instead of cutting. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s researcher gaze. The underground cavern and its warped rules anchor every beat without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to dissect or join the Changed’s song—is signaled early and tightened when Aris throws the arrowhead. Escalation is one decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the loss of her scientific detachment. No reversals needed; one meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete opposition of arrowhead (division) and garden (connection), culminating in the cosmic joke: “add your own voice.” No moralizing; the final note reweights the premise without statement. Subtext lives in the Changed’s bitter laughter and the arrowhead’s orbit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, textured, and consistent with a covert researcher’s perceptual bias—“alien chlorophyll,” “gravitationally playful energy.” Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue from the phone is static-laden and distinct, carrying subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and pattern-taught. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in the single perfect note. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid research, cosmic harmony, and gravitational mood feels inevitable and fresh. The arrowhead’s transformation from weapon to node is a non-obvious payoff that reconfigures the entire premise. Risk-taking (lyric closure, physics-as-mood) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
