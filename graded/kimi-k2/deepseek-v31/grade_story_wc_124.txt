<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s wistful empathy and Silas’s buried joy are embodied through micro-choices (offering the vial, removing the mask) and contradictory impulses (grief vs wonder). The final reunion with memory carries visible emotional cost, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: lantern delivery → ultraviolet revealing → scent-triggered memory → earned understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Silas’s stance toward his grief is permanently altered with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crystalline greenhouse, UV beams, and bioluminescent ferns are vividly selective; the lantern’s light and crystal shadows physically constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Silas’s need to grasp why the scent unmans him—tightens when the vial’s memory forces a trade-off between protective forgetting and painful recollection. Agency and cost are legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s function is not to punish but to preserve what was loved. Subtext in scent, light, and shadow avoids moralizing; the final image of reunion reweights the premise without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s wistful perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet precise. No head-hopping; dialogue is spare and subtextual, advancing the beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and paid off. No loops or scaffold; UV/crystal imagery threads cleanly through action and reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct-plant resurrection, memory-lanterns, and olfactory light form an organic whole. The ultraviolet-reveal of a buried childhood joy feels inevitable yet surprising, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
