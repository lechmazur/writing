<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “quiet, obsessive need” and “peripheral focus” manifest in concrete micro-choices (tracing light with a mirror, tuning the crystal). The flaw of storing wonder against decay is dramatized through the final cost: she leaves the cavern with the echo now stored inside the stone, a felt forfeiture of immediate wonder. One minor slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting the embodied arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s restored song reweights the world above and Elara’s stance crystallizes—she has preserved the intangible at the price of letting it leave her hands. The Causal lens holds: every beat follows because/therefore logic (broken timer → reverse-engineering → harvest restored). Cost is explicit in the final line: “a promise stored deep in the stone,” a visible conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but active constraint: its quartz veins guide light paths, its fissures birth the final note. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices acoustic shifts before visual grandeur. One nit: “metallic dust from some far-off calamity” is evocative but floats unanchored; still, it does not derail spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the mountain’s heart-sound—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each beat. The single decisive turn is the moment she slots the resonator; the cost is the irreversible transfer of wonder from her immediate senses to the stone. Pressure escalates because each deduction narrows her options until only perfect tuning will suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: preservation versus possession, reason versus wonder. The final image—echo stored in stone—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: her act of leaving the cavern is a quiet renunciation that speaks louder than any thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and locksmith-specific: “geometric silence,” “forged new gears,” “tuned by listening to the faint, dying whispers.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no POV leakage. Compression is purposeful—ellipses in time are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“polyphonic hymn”) is earned by context. One mixed metaphor—“store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is the single hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “echo engine” premise is fresh, synthesized through Elara’s craft rather than exposition. Risky lyric accumulation pays off: the cavern’s song becomes both setting and character. Transformation test passed—swap locksmith for any other artisan and the story collapses.</comment>
