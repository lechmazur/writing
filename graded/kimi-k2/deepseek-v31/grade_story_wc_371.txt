<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—seeds in pockets, fossil bread as memory anchor. Her contradictory impulses (to mourn the fade vs. plant against it) play out in micro-choices: kneeling, accepting bread, planting crocuses. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she now knows the garden must be tended in secret, a lifelong vigil. Only the single POV keeps relationship crucible off-page, so minor cap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard’s uncloaking reweights every prior perception, and the cost is the fragile covenant to keep the sacred hidden. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beat layers density until the final shimmer reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: the bread’s warmth is earned by Kael’s act, Elara’s planting is a direct response. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard’s curated decay constrains tactics—only those who see can enter, and the crocuses must be planted along a path “only they would ever walk.” Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “hollow, silent chill,” “sour earth,” “soft, inner light.” Micro-setting (the bread in hand) becomes a charged object that alters state. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder against creeping gray—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: the uncloaking reveals the battle is already being fought in hiding, tightening Elara’s task from lone planting to shared guardianship. Cost is legible: the absolution is “tenuous,” reliant on continued belief. Agency remains hers; she chooses to stay and tend.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sacredness survives only through deliberate, hidden acts of remembrance. Subtext is carried in gesture—Kael’s silence, the bread broken, the planting—never stated. Final image of crocuses along a secret path reweights the premise: the ordinary is now charged with covert sanctity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “for now, it was enough.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control: “slow leaching of color,” “fossilized roll of bread.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—she notices graying, pockets seeds, weighs absence. Kael’s single line is raspy, earned. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under wonder. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: “illusion fell away like a silken sheet.” Grammar clean, tense stable. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “a seed of color.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—wonder hidden in curated ruin—feels fresh and inevitable. Guerrilla gardening as counter-spell and cloaked sacred garden synthesize familiar tropes into specific emotional truth. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off; no derivative echoes. Transformation test fails if names change—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
