<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas emerges as a compelling interior protagonist whose grounded logic and iron commitment to constraint power the arc. His refusal to accept probable decline in favour of an impossible-certain reactor earns a credible, costly renunciation that forecloses the grey-energy future—Earned Stasis visible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: predictive modelling drives because/therefore beats that narrow from safe decline to geothermal certainty, creating a decisive change at closure. Orientation anchored by ~120; blank Page literalises choice with visible cost—the ink’s acceptance makes the future true on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, geothermal whisper bring micro-pressure via natural containment; freshwater-ice cap constraints map directly into the reactor design. Specificity overlaps stakes and inventiveness rather than mere ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Primary stake—energy fate—tightens from managed decline to inevitable invention under predictive modelling; a visible 0.0001-to-100% price is paid to forge the new path. One escalation loop suffices; coincidence is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme crystalizes via the act of writing truth into existence: innovation within inevitability. Final schematic reweights prior patterns without moralizing; resonance is embodied in the silent ink acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Close psychic distance, precise diction of cartographer and physicist; rhythm accelerates under the furnace of proof. No head-hopping; interior voice stays coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>No loops or scaffold; sentences compress under tactical pressure, high density with volcanic-ink metaphor that never muddles causality. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors rising stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The geothermal reactor that mandates a frozen lake as containment flips familiar hard-SF tropes into one inevitable design. The 0.0001-to-100% certainty pivot is novel and non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
