<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied interiority—reading fractures through water ripples—feels singular and consistent; the final renunciation (letting the drone go) carries visible cost in her solitude. Blindness is not token but causally shapes every micro-choice. Minor slip: the engineer’s plea is summarized rather than dramatized, softening relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s corrected flight reweights the premise—navigation through interference, not around it—while Elara’s isolation is the felt cost. Causal chain holds: damaged sensor → fountain test → patch → launch. No orientation drift; depot and timeline are anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, Victorian fountain, and broken skylight are not backdrop; the fountain’s water becomes the literal medium for decoding, constraining Elara’s method and charging the final image as the drone exits through the shattered pane. Sensory specificity is filtered through tactile perception, reinforcing POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the drone before the ship departs—is signaled early and tightened by the harbor clang. One meaningful escalation: realizing the drone must embrace, not avoid, turbulence. Cost is legible in Elara’s solitary stance and the fading hum; no reversals beyond scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of perception-through-interpretation emerges organically from Elara’s method and the drone’s reprogramming; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the crystalline dart disappearing into grey sky reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the drone’s bow and her listening smile is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and POV-locked; phrases like “magnetic calm” and “ghost image of the fractures” are character-specific. No head-hopping; sensory hierarchy reflects blind perception. Compression is purposeful—elided repair details are legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances action or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“crystalline dart”) are precise and consistent with physical logic. Minor density spike in “chaotic, buzzing poem” but it serves the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—blind artisan repairing a navigation drone via water-refraction—is fresh and fully committed to. Tropes of the gifted savant and ticking clock are transformed through tactile method and sensory inversion. Risk in the lyric mode pays off; closure would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>
