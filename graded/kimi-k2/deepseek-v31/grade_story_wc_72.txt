<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Veridian’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the shift from certainty to nuanced welcome is dramatized through micro-choices (shifting coral, dislodging stone, raising his own fist). The final dissolution carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Veridian’s self-shattering dissolves the prison and reconfigures the garden into living light. Causal chain (telepathic probe → flaw threading → coral shift → ampoule break) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the sentence “He saw his form begin to dissolve.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vivid, selective, and purposeful; the microscopic dome flaw and the foxglove ampoule function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Veridian’s stone-bound perception. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the creator vs. preserve the lie—is signaled early and tightens through each micro-action. Escalation is driven by Veridian’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost of dissolution is visible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: certainty weaponized versus imagination liberated. The final image of conscious sand threading through the broken dome offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the reweighted meaning of “guardian.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“carved sea-stone,” “stolen, dying light”) remains stone-bound and oceanic. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, percussive clauses during the shattering, then expansive release. Final image is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses guardian-statue, underwater prison, and telepathic liberation into a fresh synthesis. The foxglove ampoule and conscious-sand dissolution feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (lyric dissolution, non-human POV) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
