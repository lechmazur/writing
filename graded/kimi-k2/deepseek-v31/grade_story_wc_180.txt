<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—rooted hurt vs. new openness—plays out in embodied micro-choices (crumpled decree, ribbon around apple). The final renunciation of the vow is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: handing the ribboned apple crystallizes the new stance and reweights the orchard’s fate. Causal linkage holds; the Councillor’s bite is a motivated micro-turn that delays demolition with felt social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is vivid and selective; its height and rooted statues constrain movement and supply the decisive apple. Spatial choreography is coherent; the rafters-to-square transition is cleanly anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the orchard—tightens when the wreckers’ arrival becomes imminent. Escalation is driven by Elara’s choice to leave the rafters and offer the apple; the delay is earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of deciduous vs. evergreen vows emerges organically through the ribbon’s return and the orchard’s fate. Final image of the Councillor tasting the apple offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias (“rustling leaves” voice). Dialogue between Elara and Lyra carries distinct idiom and subtext; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional elevated phrasing (“deciduous vows”) fits Elara’s register. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Quartz-eye mending, aerial orchard, and ribboned apple synthesize into a fresh, specific world. The deciduous/evergreen vow inversion feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
