<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from artist to conduit is earned through micro-choices (tracing, breathing, kneeling). The flaw—spiritual passivity—compounds until the tear forces action. Cost is felt: she weeps, love pours in, work begins. One hairline slip: “unused love” is named rather than dramatized at the inciting beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear’s warmth reweights her purpose with undeniable cost (“not to keep, but to channel”). Causal chain holds: memory → directive → camera → breathing → tear → vocation. Fog-lift/star-rise image crystallizes stance. No orientation drift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s brick, wisteria, and fog constrain movement and visibility, guiding her to the pillar. Camera obscura tent functions as micro-setting/tool that literally projects the past. Final tear gleams in both projected and real space, charging closure. One notch off 9.0: environment could have imposed a sharper physical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens once when the projected image shifts, forcing a choice. Escalation is accretive: each breath deepens memory, narrowing options until the tear is seized. Cost is emotional flood and vocational pivot. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the tear) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stored compassion emerges from concrete action: tracing light, breathing mantra, grasping glass. No moralizing; final image of artist-become-healer reweights premise. Subtext in fog’s “lucidity” mirrors inner clearing. One soft echo: “heal” is spoken aloud—minor, but audible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and consistent: “smudged with charcoal and silver nitrate,” “velvet petals of night blossoms.” Perceptual signature skews visual but justifies via occupation. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments at discovery. One filter-verb cluster (“she understood now”) barely grazes 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or motive. Metaphors are precise: “bubble from a deep, dark lake,” “gauzy fog.” No loops or scaffold. Minor purple moment—“torrent of boundless, unconditional compassion”—but earned by climax. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Past-life memory + camera obscura + Kwan Yin tear synthesizes into fresh metaphysics of stored compassion. Risky fusion of tech and mysticism lands because each element constrains choice. Transformation test: swap any piece and the arc collapses. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
