<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from observer to participant is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, digging, planting). The contradiction between her “quiet obsession” and the act of theft is present but could be sharper under pressure. Cost is legible in the final image: she forfeits the shard and her detachment. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each displaced object layers density until the orris root completes the mosaic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the house’s “contented sigh” reweights the premise with felt cost (Elara’s complicity in theft). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (shore → garden) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Coastal bay, Victorian bluff, and micro-objects (stone, saucer, feather) are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias. The garden soil constrains her kneeling action; the orris root’s scent charges the final consecration. Selective sensory detail (violet scent, damp earth) supports theme without cataloging. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the house gathers, not generates. One deepening beat: her decision to plant the shard narrows her role from observer to accomplice. Cost is the ethical theft of “stolen silence.” Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sanctity through quiet theft. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, covering the shard) and image (windows shimmer with potential). Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “a mosaic of displaced and donated serenity.” No thematic drift; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent (“noticer of creeping normality”). Compression and patterned elision taught early (“the world didn’t fall silent—it deepened”). No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. POV remains stable; diction stays within Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful (“velvet blanket of hush”). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Opening and closing lines are charged and specific. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—houses animated by curated silence—is fresh and fully committed to. Tropes (haunted house, found object) are transformed through sensory specificity and ethical ambiguity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
