<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—solitary mockery vs. world-shaping duty—are embodied in the tremor of his hand and the rasp of his laugh; the final beat crystallizes his awe and terror, paying the cost of irreversible historical meddling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (storm sense → lens tweak → beam steering → political fallout) links by “because/therefore.” Closure lands as a Decisive Change—Silas’s realization that his jest rewrote history—charged with the felt cost of godlike responsibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>The lighthouse’s green prisms and captive starlight constrain every action; the storm’s ozone taste and the beam’s emerald twist are vivid, selective, and directly steer the climax. Environment, tool, and body interlock to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—guiding fate itself—tightens when the beam folds inward; the millimeter adjustment escalates stakes from safe passage to world-altering power. Cost is legible: Silas’s laughter turns to fearful awe as history bends.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: cosmic absurdity meets human agency. The “Kingmaker” jest reframed as destiny’s pivot offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer—power discovered in mockery—without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—salt-crusted, sardonic, yet awestruck; perceptual signature filters every detail through Silas’s weathered cynicism. Rhythm modulates with storm pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“river of green fire”) is purposeful and paid off. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Syntax accelerates with the gale; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse as fate-engine, starlight wick as steering mechanism, accidental prophecy as political lever. Risky inversion of storm-as-tool feels inevitable in hindsight; no stock tropes survive intact.</comment>
