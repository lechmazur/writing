<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—guilt versus the need to act—remains embodied in the fidgeting hands and the tapestry decoding; the final placement of the labyrinth crystallizes his earned absolution with visible cost (the empty plinth, resumed life without him). Reflection blocks are concise and tilt present tactics. Only the prince’s death is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: fraying thread → decoding → plaza discovery → labyrinth click → temporal rupture. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Kael’s exile ends but he remains outside the flow of time he restored. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen village is not mere backdrop; its glazed cobblestones and eternal dew constrain movement and perception, while the tapestry’s border literally maps the spell. Micro-setting (plinth) becomes the keystone. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the fraying thread signals a live chance to act. Escalation is causal: each decoded symbol narrows options until only the plaza remains. Cost is the resumed world moving on without him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through the very skills that caused ruin emerges organically from the chess-tutor background and tapestry decoding. Final image of bustling square with Kael alone offers non-literal absolution without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, tactile, slightly archaic diction matching a strategist’s mind. Compression and patterned elision (“woven hush,” “fierce repose”) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cosmological schema”) stays within Kael’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time village as moral crucible for a chess master is fresh; the tapestry-as-map device transforms a decorative object into narrative engine. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
