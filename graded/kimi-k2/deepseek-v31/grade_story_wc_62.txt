<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eliran’s interiority is textured and embodied; the shift from solitary carver to translator of collective grief is earned through tactile micro-choices with the ribbons and greenhouse. The spectral chorus is credibly internal, not expository. Cost is felt in the final renunciation of static monuments for living memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (voice, ribbons, butterflies) thickens until the final image reweights grief as motion. Closure is a Charged Poise—Eliran’s new stance crystallizes with visible conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse, vine, and migrating butterflies are rendered with selective sensory precision that constrains Eliran’s epiphany; the living canopy literally shapes his final stance. Micro-setting (mossy bench, passionflower) functions as charged object. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—tightens through escalating sensory density rather than external reversals. The butterfly river deepens the cost of static carving; final stance forecloses monument-as-endpoint. Agency remains Eliran’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as migratory current, not stone. Subtext resides in the ribbons’ fading colors and the butterflies’ relentless motion. Final image offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers—beauty and loss inseparable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary and hushed, mirroring a carver’s patience; syntax slows or quickens with attention. No head-hopping; spectral voices remain internal murmurs. Distinct perceptual signature—granite dust, vine tendrils, wing-beat hush—persists under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the lyric register without drift.</comment>

<comment>Premise fuses stone-carving, spectral poetics, and butterfly migration into a fresh meditation on grief’s motion. Familiar tropes—ghost mentor, abandoned greenhouse—are transformed through sensory specificity and thematic inversion. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
