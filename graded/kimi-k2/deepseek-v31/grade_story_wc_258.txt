<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity anchors every beat, but interior contradictions are announced rather than dramatized; the impulse to confide gains force only after she sees Gable’s fear. Gable’s shift from bragging to vulnerability is sketched economically and felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: from tarot abstraction to collaborative roof repair, the shift reconfigures old/new value. Measuring tape’s return from symbolic object to practical tool crystallizes the Conceptual Repricing; cost is the crypto era ended, community repair the new currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Loft skylight, rain droplets, attic joists are concrete and tactile; tape guides spatial moves and becomes the setting-in-miniature that constrains action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Primary stake—proving the collapse is a correction—escalates through each data-point Elara takes; cooperation fixes the leak while enacting that correction. Stakes stay visceral, no coincidence resolves; choice yields a visible price of sweat, proximity, time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via gesture—tape applied to rain leak, tarot and data fused into act of repair. No articulated lesson: pattern felt, not told. Quiet ending’s soaked rafters reinterpreted as communal chart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, tactile, precise—cartomancer’s exactitude conveyed in measured clauses and sensory compression. Elara’s perceptual filter selects ink, water, metal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is elegant and compressed; rhythmic variation carries attention, no redundancy clogs the repair climb. Rain motif threaded cleanly through every beat.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Crypto-collapse-meets-supernatural-forensics feels fresh; reverse-engineered future-via-loom blends genres without gimmickry.</question>
