<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her fear of losing sanity and her disciplined craft anchor every micro-choice. The synchronized-breathing pivot is earned by prior obsession and embodied cost. Minor: “firmly grounded” is asserted more than dramatized until the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—dream and orchard coexist under a new perceptual rule, cost paid in irrevocable shift of reality. Causal chain (sextant → rebuild → breath-sync) holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog, frost, and ruined orchard are not backdrop but active constraint: fog thins under the sextant, frost crystallizes the moment, stone wall becomes bridge. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s lens. One minor spatial slip: “skeletal heart” is evocative but momentarily disorients.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture or coexist with the dream—is signaled early and tightened through each calibration of the sextant. Final breath-sync is the decisive narrowing of options; cost is the irreversible overlay of two realities. No extraneous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception-as-reality emerges organically from Elara’s craft and final synchronization; no moralizing. The glass-mountains tone reweights from distant hallucination to marrow-felt chord. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly archaic without pastiche; perceptual signature filters every detail through mirror-maker’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under frost, longer cadences during sync. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One near-redundancy—“perpetual gloom… perpetual grey”—but forgiven under lyric pattern. High information density sustains momentum to final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—dream-city, fog, sextant—are transmuted through Elara’s specific craft and breath-sync method. The overlay ending feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
