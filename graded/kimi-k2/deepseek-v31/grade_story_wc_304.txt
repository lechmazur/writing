<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s single-minded pursuit to “capture one last spark” shapes every beat, aligning action with motive; however, the geomancer remains a passive subject, not a crucible, so relational pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ending’s Charged Poise reconfigures stakes—the emerald now glows with a life not yet paid for—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the causal moment of physical stillness services the pattern-intensification and lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rarefied details (“crystalline grotto...aurora overhead”) act as direct constraints: the floating silence literally permits Elara’s breath-arrest stillness; the space charges the final image as the locus of captured light.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“snatch one brilliant note before the eternal quiet”—is coherently escalated by successive compressions: bodily anointment → emerald reading → threshold crossing; the final infusion tightens options and pays an unambiguous price (Elara’s temporary death-state).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of reclaiming beauty from death emerges organically from ritual specifics; the glowing emerald silently reweights why mortuary art matters, offering conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression sustains a distinct, almost liturgical cadence; occasional elevated diction suits Elara’s reverent stance and is self-consistent within the single POV.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Imagery is dense yet purposeful, every sentence advancing either sensory charge or procedural motion; small tautology (“radiant hush of the grotto holding her in its gentle embrace”) truncates peak-band potential.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “cosmic funeral beautician” premise, though overt, is rendered with such tactile specificity and private ritual boldness that it feels unprecedented; the risk—temporary self-annulment—heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
