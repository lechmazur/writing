<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—impatience forged into patience—remains embodied in micro-choices (checking charts, holding ground) and culminates in the earned renunciation of forcing the change. The transformation is credible and scaled to length, though the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps her arc from the highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “patient revolution” crystallizes in the sanctuary’s awakening, with visible cost (her impatience sloughed away). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each celestial alignment and magnetic pulse is foreshadowed and paid off. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and rain-beaded viaduct are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (cold limits movement, magnetic stone channels energy). The setting charges the final image: the clarified ice becomes a lens that reweights the theme. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—will the moons unyoke the sanctuary tonight?—tightens through incremental celestial movement and magnetic hum. The protagonist’s agency is attentive witness, a credible stance crystallized at climax. Cost is felt in her relinquished restlessness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: patience as active vigilance, revolution as quiet awakening. The final image of clarified ice reflecting “truer stars” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and stone rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature rooted in celestial mechanics and mineral cold. Syntax modulates with tension—short clauses under storm light, longer cadences during reflection—without overwriting. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise (“mercury-bright gleam,” “stone waking”). Minor scaffold appears in one or two near-repetitions (“patient revolution” phrasing) but never clouds the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of geomancy, magnetism, and quietist politics feels fresh; familiar tropes of celestial alignment are retooled through tactile basalt and frozen optics. Specificity of the “magnetic viaduct after rain” anchors the concept. Risk is measured but coherent.</comment>
