<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s guarded nature shapes every choice: her refusal to bargain with the seed, the embodied contradiction in holding pain without yielding. Interiority remains tactile—burning seed, numbed hand—and the final renunciation is earned through prior causality and visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: spell failure (inciting) → containment transfer → forced choice. Closure lands on-page: cold seed encased in frost, a decisive Change & Cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Obsidian seed’s body, lake’s icy water, silver orchard—each constrains choices. Seed freezes in hand; lake stilled becomes arena. Vivid, selective specifics root the final crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: stop catastrophe vs consume everything. Escalation crystallizes in the burning seed offer—new, narrowed choice with unpayable price. Stakes scale to word count and resonate through final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: hunger vs healing, containment vs consumption. Epiphany earned through specific struggle; ending reframes “cursed” as jailer, answering “mirrors don’t show” without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct druidic cadence: “gnarled ironwood,” “rotating petals of bark and leaf.” POV remains internal; no voice slip. Compression under pressure: short breaths in chants vs long lifts in descriptions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm tightens with crisis—compressed syntax, varied sentence openings. Metaphor crisp: “frozen confession,” “breath from root to stone.” No loops; diction precise, purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Classic mirror-quest inverted into jailer-perspective vortex; seed is non-obvious villain. Risky lyric reprise in final image (hardened confession) charges closure without lingers of cliché.</comment>
