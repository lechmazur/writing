<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Isla’s motives (preserve vs efficiency) remain specific and embodied; the trembling sigh and grime-track tear show cost. However, some interior moments glide to “life’s work” or “dappled resolve” labels that flatten contradiction—just shy of crisp contradictions in real-time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal: every “therefore” from compass-rose clue → chain measurement → bypass chamber leads to a crystallising presentation that forecloses flooding. Closure moment satisfies both Council and memory without causal stretch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The volcano’s breathing stone isn’t backdrop; every dilation times Isla’s beats and constrains movement. Micro-setting in tools—antique chain’s “counterweight”—directly shapes the technical alternative to flooding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (preserve historic chambers vs safety) tightens once the chain’s structural math trumps zero-sum choice; pressure peaks when mountain groans sync with breath-cycle clock. Cost of sleepless breath-cycle labour is visibly paid before Council acclimates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of harmonising memory and function emerges organically from measured bypass; no moralising, just weighted final gear-turn mirroring chamber breath. Compass-rose quietly revalues duty into encrypted compassion without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Deft rhythmic control—phrases shorten under pressure then expand into final image. Distinct perceptual lens in Isla’s tactile chain handling and geothermal hum; POV stays single and confident throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut: every sentence does map, tool, or breath-cycle work. Occasional slight uplift in diction (“ingenuous mind”) but never muddles causality or closure. Rhythm accelerates during peak design sprint without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk floodgates with living volcano without cliché; antique chain as literal historical counterweight repurposed in mechanical epiphany feels freshly inevitable. Slight risk of neat cipher code pays off in understated nod rather than gimmick.</comment>
