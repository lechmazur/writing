<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“quiet, desperate need”), her motive is consistent, and the final renunciation—silencing the purser’s lie—carries felt cost. Yet the absence of on-page contradiction or micro-choice under pressure keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the purser’s fraud is exposed, the collective memory is cleansed, and the cost is the purser’s eternal silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dream shard tightens the mosaic until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glacial shrine is not mere backdrop; its “borrowed starlight” and “compressed light of centuries” charge the final image when the candles reflect in the melted globe, making the ice itself seem to hold its breath. One more sensory constraint on choice would have nudged it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging a single untainted truth—escalates through each dream fragment until the Reykjavik window forecloses all other readings. The cost is the purser’s obliterated lie, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth as salvage from collective trauma. The melted globe’s final reflection offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer—some truths are too heavy to hold intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature (“compressed light of centuries,” “psychic shrapnel”) that remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor scaffold (“her true work, however”) is negligible and does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—harvesting dream cameos to reconstruct maritime ghosts—is fresh, fully committed, and synthesized through specific sensory detail. The risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
