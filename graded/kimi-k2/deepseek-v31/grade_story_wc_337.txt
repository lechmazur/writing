<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied (cold dread, phantom taste, tremoring hands); her micro-persistence under pressure and the final “lifted weight” mark earned change. No contradictory drive shown, and the guilt she carries for Kael remains off-stage, so character depth caps shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens consistent: each tug at the net thickens silence until it “breaks” and “unwraps” in a Cadence Shift RR whose cost feels immediate (“the weight... lifted”). One mild slip—method described in “fragile scroll” exposition instead of discovery—prevents 9 flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Glass domed cliff chamber, fracturing starlight, and coiled net are select, sensorially sharp, and serve the climactic charge; they shape tactical access (light for sight, net as memory channel) rather than mere backdrop. Still, they provide setting rather than final constraint, capping high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“quiet a drowned spirit without merely patching clay”—intensifies knot by knot; each loosened loop raises literal and moral cost. Escalation is textured (pressure → chill → memory flood) rather than crescendo, then lands at crystallized absolution. One pacing wobble late-middle when ghost memory floods in a single summary block caps 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Guilt, truth, and mercy weave emergently through the unraveling net—not moralized. “Unraveling guilt to find peace” is paid for by Elara’s embodied shaming taste, so theme arrives without label. A hair of tidy symmetry (net slack = silence unwrapping) slightly blunts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, glass-shard rhythm mirrors Elara’s careful craft; precision in phrases like “interlaced hush” teaches the pattern early and revisits it as “light with the quiet of a story fully told.” Free of clutter or modal drift; diction stays within artisan register even under bodily dread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density, elegant variation, minimal scaffolding. Minor figurative pile-up in first paragraph (“woven tapestry of withheld breaths”) and one paraphrase loop (“silence... heavier... heavier”) deduct a fraction; nevertheless, prose remains musical and propels without drag until end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Fresher synthesis: mask-repair-as-confession-via-rope-archaeology, quiet archaeology trope shifted into tactile forensic ritual. Feels bespoke. Familiar “release of drowned spirit’s secret” story skeleton remains recognizable, keeping it out of 8.5+ band.</comment>
