<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her hands flew… frantic energy”), motives escalate from duty to personal loyalty, and the final pull of the lever carries earned cost. The contradictory pull between isolation and responsibility is dramatized, not labeled. Only the mentor remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; no deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: spike → distress call → locked protocols → buckle key → manual release, each beat tightening options. Closure is a decisive physical act (pod ejection) that forecloses return to the arbor and carries the cost of irreversible descent. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The arbor’s hiss, red emergency lights, and the engraved buckle all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (“violent screech,” “jarring thud”). Micro-setting (buckle-as-key) functions as setting-object that enables escape. No credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve Elias’s trust—drives every beat. Escalation is causal: signal → locked system → hidden key → irreversible launch. One tightening suffices; the lever pull visibly forecloses the safety of the arbor. Cost is the loss of her post and exposure to planetary storm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited responsibility emerges from concrete objects (buckle, pod) and choices rather than statement. Final image of “tiny speck of determined light” reweights the arbor from sanctuary to abandoned lifeboat. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about Elias’s fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, compressed, and sensorily biased to Lena’s technician mindset (“spectral readouts,” “manual override panel”). Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Patterned elision (e.g., ellipsis in distress call) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“plunged,” “sped”) and concrete nouns dominate. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“cosmic anomaly lost to the darkness”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line lands with cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines hard-SF isolation with intimate mentor relic in a way that feels inevitable. The buckle-as-key twist is foreshadowed yet surprising, transforming a charm into plot engine. Specificity of the engraved schematic and the arbor’s balloon suspension create freshness. Risky single-setting start pays off.</comment>
