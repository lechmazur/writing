<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid— embodied grief and gravitational defiance track under pressure— but some timeline flashbacks are summarized rather than dramatized, muting contradiction expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure is earned: stepping off the viaduct is a decisive act that reconfigures his stance toward gravity and memory; the causal push is clear and the “labyrinth of self” is literally navigated via procedural generation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct’s light/abyss contrast constrains each step; the dripping stones and mist pin spatial choices and reinforce the theme of walking into brightness to discover inner darkness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure accrues as each memory demands renunciation; the dominant stake is the refusal to fall—climaxing with the choice to fall—under coherent escalating stakes with perceptible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of accepting fracture drives the arc; the final image of the fall reweights “conquest” into surrender without moralizing, resonant and non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical compression is purpose-driven; gravity-defying POV bias color’s perception without filter stacks; final lines crystallize into a rhythmic, voice-specific Poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Compression is clean, no loops or scaffold. Prose propels with sentence-level urgency; fantastical metaphors serve pressure without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reverses the gravity-defier trope into surrender myth. The procedural bridge-as-self roadmap is non-obvious and the fall transforms a familiar savior motif into earned stasis.</comment>
