<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia drives every early choice; her decisive act of surrendering the doll at the climax manifests a visible, embodied shift from terror to beatific acceptance. One deduction for summarizing her new understanding too neatly instead of dramatizing the contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Trajectory from bunker claustrophobia → inversion → trellis float → planting the doll is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens that uses density and pattern reweighting. Closure lands on a Charged Poise as the trellis reconfigures the prior stakes of confinement into boundless possibility; gravity’s return is its immediate cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The bunker’s collapsing-lung aura, canned-air scent, and wrench-floating moment anchor space via the character’s body, while the trellis above clouds supplies a micro-setting that constrains Elara’s final choice. The xenial trellis earns an environment-to-actuator payoff when it receives the doll and blooms, but a minor deduction for not sustaining tactile detail across descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—survive vs. transcend fear—tightens meaningfully during the inversion window; Elara’s panic narrows options until she chooses to plant the doll, renouncing her former refuge. The only missing leg is an on-page tangible loss other than the hour itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: terror of confinement transmuted into voluntary, sacrificial openness. Subtext is earned through the doll’s placement rather than articulated theory; final flower-bloom image reweights earlier bunker silence without overt moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric compression (“synapse of pure beauty”) and POV-tuned sensory narrowing under panic feel authentic; voice modulation under gravity-inversion pressure is controlled without clarity loss, and no slips that touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is nearly loop-free; rhythmic propulsion mirrors ascent. Minor figurative density (“gilded hush”) stays within taught pattern. No artifacts contaminate the bloom moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>A fresh alchemy: claustrophobia + inverted physics + trellis mythos achieves inevitability in hindsight. Specificity (porcelain doll gift, canned-air scent) personalizes cosmic metaphor without retreat into safety middle.</comment>
