<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elros's interiority is richly embodied—grief in clenched fingers on seed pods, relief in the “faint, rustling click.” Motivation (garden over graves) stays taut, and the renunciation of violence carries embodied cost; the single moment of speaking ghosts into soil reconfigures his vow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative: nightly ritual → seeding → listening for sprout. Closure is Charged Poise: the final seed split re-weights the battlefield’s future. Each beat escalates texture, tightening from coral death to green life with visible patience as price under an earned stance.</comment>

<comment>“Blooming jetty at twilight” is both micro-setting and charged object: narrow stone path constrains every step, while algae lights ground the final image. Spatial anchors are clear within 120 words; “ghostly pulse” and salt-scrubbed mudflats feel specific and embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>
<comment>Dominant stake—bury the past by growing it—tightens once when Elros must decide that listening (not forcing) counts as fertilizing. Cost is visible time, breath, vulnerability; no external antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Theme of memory as soil composts without slogans; final seed-split answers the question “what grows from battlefields?” with non-literal but undeniable new life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</comment>
<comment>Voice stays lyrical yet precise (“seed pods clink like tiny bones”), never drifting into purple. Distinct perceptual stance: filtered through ears attuned to bird-code, hands attuned to soil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Prose sings with selective synecdoche (“water-stained love letter in a cannon’s mouth”) and zero wasteful loops. Metaphors stay controlled; final sentence holds clean clarity of action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Fresh angle: landscaper as priest of silence, seeding battlefields with the words of the dead—a synthesis that feels inevitable once voiced.</comment>
