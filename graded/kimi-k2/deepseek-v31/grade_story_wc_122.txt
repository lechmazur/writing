<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inara’s interior contradiction – her drive to defeat numbness by embracing greater silence – is embodied and specific; her final micro-choice to stage the recital crystallizes her arc with felt cost (“she had not restored sound, but remade silence”). Leo’s transformation remains functional but less textured. Causation and motivation are clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant lens is thematic/textural: beats accumulate resonance until the recital recalibrates meaning. Closure lands in the muted collective applause—Earned Stasis that remakes silence sacred, explicit cost on page. Orientation and cue density are clean. Small drag from mild mosaic structure. Meets high-band gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sound-proof cavern and stone thermal micro-signals; the phonograph horn and cello body act as micro-settings constraining choice. Anchor solid. One or two sensory passages slightly surplus to beat pressure. Overall strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: Inara’s defeat of numbness. Pressure tightens as Leo's playing achieves deeper vibration each week; recital forces final stance crystallization with visible cost. Causation holds; no coincidences resolve conflict. Slight taper toward epilogue—still tight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges tacitly: silence as presence, effort without reward felt as reverence. Final image of silent applause is earned resonance rather than moral sermon. Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, rhythmic prose with perceptual signature tied to tactile perception. POV distance held cleanly; no head-hopping. Vivid, controlled diction supports motif of vibration. Clean execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines, rhythmic variation, concrete image chains. One minor metaphor stack near recital description, does not obscure. Clean proofreading. Closure image sharp and unmuddled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Mute-healer teaching music-through-vibration is rare, executed via backward phonograph grooves transformed into touch sonics. Central concept reframes silence, not merely novelty but integral to final resonance. Risky choice pays off.</question>
