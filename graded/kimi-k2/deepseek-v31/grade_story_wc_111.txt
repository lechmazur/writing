<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—preserving beauty while orchestrating decay—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (polishing marbles, propping leaves). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she secures a reprieve yet must continue the daily mend. Secondary pressure from Lord Cederic is brief but sufficient to test her resolve. One hairline slip: “wisely pragmatic” is label-speak mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s refusal to surrender the garden forecloses Lord Cederic’s threat with a conceded nod, leaving her to bear the ongoing cost of deception. Causal chain holds: polishing ritual → proof of memory → reprieve. Lens is Causal; every beat links because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by 120 words. No teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as micro-setting: its hidden plinth, wires, and mist constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—damp earth, aromatic mist—filtered through Elara’s caretaker bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One minor drift: “city square” is named but never re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the garden’s illusion—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: Luck-Meter reading → threat of shutdown → Elara’s proof. Cost is visible: she must perpetuate the exhausting charade. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty through brokenness” emerges organically from cracked marbles, wired vines, and Elara’s cracked body. Final image—sunlight through fractured glass—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Lord Cederic’s silent nod carries more than dialogue. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, horticultural diction (“grafted moon-rose,” “white blight”) and rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven, carrying subtext. One brief register lift—“philosophy”—is earned by character tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is precise—“cracks gleamed like silver veins”—without clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of quantified luck versus organic memory feels fresh; cracked marbles as living archive is non-obvious. Tropes of dying garden and stubborn caretaker are transformed through specific caretaking deceits. Final reconfiguration—deception as loyalty—grows inevitably from prior particulars. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
