<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist’s rigor colliding with whale-borne empathy—is embodied in micro-choices (the first touch of the tile, the final broadcast) and results in a credible renunciation: he abandons “data over wonder” to become the whales’ mirror, a change that both costs and recharges his original stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A Causal lens holds: tile resonance triggers sensation → nightly memories → pattern-motivated broadcast → whales’ song deepens. Closure—Elias crafting and broadcasting the whale’s own kindness back at them—creates a Decisive Change visible in the ending beat with a felt cost: he alters his life’s work from skeptic to believer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tower’s copper dome, whale songs as second-by-second interior pressure, and the cliff as spatial threat all constrain choices; the ocean proximity enables the climax broadcast. Details are filtered through Elias’s scientific POV and return as a resonant final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the universe is not chaotic noise—escalates nightly as whale memories intensify; agency culminates when Elias turns his transcription apparatus outward, tightening options and forcing a public act with visible cost. One decisive intensification is sufficient and well-tuned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The “structured resonance” theme grows from concrete acts: Elias’s charts → whale memories → final broadcast kindness. Subtext deepens through the tile’s evolving glow, ending in a non-literal answer—kindness sung back to its owners—that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Precise scientific diction cohabits with sensory immersion (“thrumming music,” “Arctic krill-mass”); interiority is whale-filtered, not label-speak. The final broadcast retains the scientist’s procedural voice even in surrender, one controlled syntactic swell before the closing creshendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density and natural rhythm; no loops, 132-word continuous sweet spot. Figurative language foregrounds tactile data (“sheeted foam,” “ink-black veins”) without obstruction.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>A fresh synthesis—whale songs as externalized memories, redeemed via tile-numerical music score—feels inevitable; the final risk of broadcasting that score at sea crystallizes stakes without cliche.</comment>
