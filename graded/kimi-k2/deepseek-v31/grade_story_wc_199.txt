<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aisling’s quiet obsession with leaf-messages is embodied in tactile seed-sorting rituals and the micro-choice to honor a speck; her interiority stays concrete. The final transformation feels earned because her reverence for forgotten things triggers the Arbor’s awakening, costing her prior anonymity. Yet the shift from “secret” to “living librarian” is compressed into a single beat, blurring the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shrine adds density until the moonstone flare reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Aisling becomes the library—charged by the visible price of irreversible fusion with the Arbor. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Ashen arbor is rendered through filtered perception—grey seeds, violet dusk, mossy scent—guiding every micro-choice. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting that finally rewrites the world-rule. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaves—tightens when reverence for one speck unlocks the entire archive. One decisive intensification: frozen leaves reveal luminous script. Cost is the loss of separateness, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance as living archive emerges through ritual action, not statement. The final image reweights every prior leaf-fall as ongoing publication. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost of fusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, and arboreal—“mossy delight,” “vegetative thoughts”—consistent under pressure. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Patterned elision (frozen leaves) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dendritic library and moonstone memory feels fresh and inevitable. The premise transforms familiar “tree of knowledge” trope through tactile specificity. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
