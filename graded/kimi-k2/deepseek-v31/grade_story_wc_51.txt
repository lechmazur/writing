<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between her need to measure sorrow and her fear of being consumed is dramatized in the calcification beat. The moment she relaxes into the grief—micro-choice with visible cost—earns her endurance and closes her arc. No stock phrasing; every sensation is filtered through her vocation. Flaw: the “fractal weaver” label is never tested by an on-page rule or limit, so competence feels slightly unbounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is immediate and spatial choreography is clean. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of the sorrow’s weight crystallizes into mineralized gloves—visible, irreversible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of grief increases until the final cadence shift. No causality breaks; every beat is either preparation for or consequence of the calcification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bronze grotto is rendered through tactile detail and metallic light; the lamp’s flame and the calcifying wall become micro-settings that constrain action. Sensory selection is urgent—cold, damp, metallic—mirroring Elara’s internal state. Spatial tracking is flawless; no floating rooms. The grotto’s starlit shimmer charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect the new sorrow without being destroyed—is signaled early and tightened when the grief begins to harden. Escalation is driven by Elara’s misalignment and subsequent surrender; the calcification narrows her options to endure or be encased. Cost is palpable: her hands are now gloved in mineralized grief. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of bearing witness to sorrow emerges through the act of measurement and surrender; no direct statement. The whalebone reverie motif returns as the calcified lace, reweighting the concept of “architecture of loss.” Subtext is carried by silence and touch. Final image reframes the grotto as both tomb and reliquary—resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; fractal vocabulary feels native to Elara’s perception. Syntax lengthens under calm, then fragments during calcification, mirroring emotional pressure. No POV leakage; every detail is filtered through her senses. Distinct perceptual signature—she “reads” sorrow as weight and pattern—sustained to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—grotto as “roof of overlapping feathers,” calcification as “second skin of冰冷的stone.” No loops, no scaffold. Minor slip: “冰冷的stone” mixes English and pinyin; context makes meaning clear, but the artifact nudges the score down from 9.0.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fractal-weaver premise is fresh; grief as measurable mass reframed through mineral accretion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in the lyric mode and paid off by the calcification image. No close echoes; the whalebone reverie is original diction. Synthesis of vocation, setting, and theme is non-obvious yet coherent.</comment>
