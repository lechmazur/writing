<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Librarian’s serene, ritualized caretaking and Elian’s tremulous acceptance both feel embodied; the moment Elian “shuddered, tears tracing lines” crystallizes contradictory grief/joy without label-speak. Motivation (“preserve wonder in routine”) is dramatized through the meticulous handling of the creel and the tidal pause. The final stance—Elian expanded, not erased—earns its cost on the page. Minor: Librarian’s interiority is more archetype than idiosyncrasy, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the suspended tide resumes only after Elian absorbs the swarm, making the before/after legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, tide, and identity swells until the cadence shifts. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. One causal micro-turn: the full-moon apex triggers the release. Cost is visible in Elian’s tear-streaked, timeless calm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tidal atrium is more than backdrop; the halting heartbeat of seawater literally pauses to mark the seam in time, charging the final image. Micro-setting (creel, plinth, wet stone) constrains gesture and pacing. Sensory selection is urgent yet spare—“wintersun serenity” filters through POV. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can one vessel hold multitudes without rupture—signaled early and tightened by the moon-phase apex. Escalation is accretive: identities swirl, cocoon, then flood. Elian’s agency is the act of non-resistance; the cost is the irreversible expansion of self. No false relief; the tide’s resumption confirms the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of preserving wonder through routine maintenance emerges from the Librarian’s patient ritual and Elian’s tearful acceptance of contradiction. No explicit moralizing; the final image of “deep, timeless calm” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext lives in gesture—the creel’s woven bamboo, the halted tide—rather than exposition. Complexity is honored: joy and grief coexist without tidy synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, modulating from the Librarian’s low-reed cadence to Elian’s hushed awe. Perceptual signature is consistent: metallic whirr, tidal pulse, wintersun light. No POV drift; sensory hierarchy reflects each focalizer’s priorities. Dialogue is minimal but tonally distinct; Elian’s stammered “But how?” feels spoken, not written.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “seawater pulsed through fissures in the floor with the rhythm of a great, sleeping heart” does triple duty. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence lengths ebb and flow like the tide itself. Zero artifacts in peak beats; clarity never falters at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—migration of identities via moon-timed smelt—feels fresh yet inevitable. The bamboo creel as soul-conduit subverts the expected ledger or key. Transformation test fails if relocated: the tidal atrium, moon-phase constraint, and fisher’s tool are inseparable from the emotional arc. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final crystallized image.</comment>
