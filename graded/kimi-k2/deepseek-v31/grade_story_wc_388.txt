<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara's "to excavate…no matter how deeply" is clear and reiterated, but interior contradiction—her drive vs. compassion to shield the orchard—never turns a decisive present beat; the final choice is intuited via stillness rather than earned through visible dilemma. She remains sharply observant, yet no micro-choice during the storm visibly weighs abandoning the dig against continuing it, so cost feels abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The causal arc lands with Earned Stasis: the orchard survives because Elara leaves the diamond buried—an on-page decision with environmental cost (knowledge withheld). Closure is coherent under the Causal lens, but the researcher’s frantic letters serve as retrospective exposition rather than a tightening beat that pressures her final action; we infer rather than witness the stakes being sealed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Radiant wasteland orchard, dust storms, rusted lockbox, and the diamond’s null-energy pocket are vividly specified and physically active—they dictate dig site access, storm shelter, and the choice to re-bury. However, these elements shape tactics more in retrospect than during the immediate scene; they contextualize rather than constrict the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“truth vs. survival”—is anchored early and tightened through the discovery that revelation equals destruction. Pressure reaches crystallization when Elara realizes weaponization risk and chooses silence during the storm, narrowing her former investigative options. Legible, felt cost is present in leaving the orchard a secret.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “truth vs. liveable lies” emerges organically from Elara’s arc and the orchard’s paradoxical ecology. The final image—reburied diamond, orchard spared—offers a resonant non-moral answer: some knowledge is toxic. Subtext is delivered through action (sealing the lock-box with fresh earth) not editorializing.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The narration maintains a precise, scientist-poet diction that fits Elara’s mindset (e.g., “radioactive grit,” “null-energy pocket”) and compresses gracefully without dropping comprehension. No POV leakage; lyrical syntax mirrors the storm and the internal “stillpoint” without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses with sensory specificity and varied sentence rhythms. Occasional stacked modifiers (“perpetual orange haze”) skirt overwriting but never obscure action; crucial phrases like “storm reached its fever pitch” accelerate the cadence appropriately. No filter-verb clog in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The cursed-apocalypse-thriving-orchard is familiar post-apocalyptic material, yet the pivot from stone-as-curse to crystalline-null-space is surprising and internally consistent. The stillpoint device reweights a geological anomaly into a quiet anti-weapon; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
