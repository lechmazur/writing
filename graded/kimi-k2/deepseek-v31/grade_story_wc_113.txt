<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the hall vs. duty to Valerius—play out in embodied micro-choices (tuning to drips, playing the rests). The final renunciation (letting the building collapse) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the groaning stone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last note reweights the entire premise, turning destruction into release. Causal linkage holds: water reveals cipher → cipher dictates frequency → frequency triggers collapse. Cost is legible in the “newer, deeper silence.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flooded auditorium and lantern light are not backdrop; water pressure and decaying timber constrain every step and enable the cipher reveal. Final image of still water reflecting lanterns crystallizes the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode and enact Valerius’s final work—tightens once: discovery of the cipher forces the irreversible choice to play. Agency is hers; the building’s groan is the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art as elegy, destruction as mercy. The ending’s “single, transformative note” reweights all prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed awe to resonant command. Sensory diction (“sodden, crumbling booklet,” “fine snow” of plaster) stays within Elara’s perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“water as reagent”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Flood-as-reagent and score-as-cipher synthesize familiar tropes into an inevitable, non-obvious closure. Risk-taking (playing to collapse the hall) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
