<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “quietly persistent need” is dramatized through the tactile act of pouring memory into the swan. The final choice—offering silence as vessel—earns the carousel’s song with visible cost (her lifelong reserve spent). No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the carousel’s first turn reweights the entire scene. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—silence transmuted into song—charged by the glowing halo fragment. Cost is legible in the dusting chains and Elara’s emptied stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misting hush and whispering gleam are not backdrop but active pressure; the wet air muffles sound, making the carousel’s eventual voice more startling. The flatbed’s rotted boards and brittle chains constrain Elara’s movements and underscore stakes. Environment charges the final image without a single extraneous detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore voice to the silenced machine—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes tools alone will fail. One decisive intensification: the halo fragment glows, chains dissolve, carousel sings. Cost is felt in the irreversible expenditure of her private silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence not as absence but as generative possibility. The carousel’s wordless song answers the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the palm on the swan, the dust of chains—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s restorative gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in description, clipped fragments at the click of gears. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm mirrors the carousel’s gathering motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—abandoned circus, magical restoration—are transformed through Elara’s vocation and the carousel’s non-musical song. The synthesis feels inevitable: a silent carpenter who gives her silence away. Specificity of the mother-of-pearl halo fragment anchors the magic in tactile reality.</comment>
