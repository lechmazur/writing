<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “reading the fissures like a map of past failures” shows contradiction and cost. Motivation (create music) is constant and intensifies through micro-choices (shaving wood, repositioning arch). The final strum is earned by prior forensic empathy and carries visible emotional cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single note reweights the premise—silence is no longer absolute. Causal lens holds: each beat (porcelain listening, crack analysis, tension adjustment) tightens toward the final chord. Cost is legible in her tears and the “humble beginning” admission. Orientation anchored by hedgehog marker and grove details within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grove functions as micro-setting: the alder trunks physically constrain arch placement and supply heartstring fibers. Porcelain insulator evolves from passive listener to active mediator, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she “feels for the latent song,” not tourist catalog. Weather (mute wind) directly affects stakes and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sound—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: failure of first sculpture → crack analysis → redesign → first note. One meaningful tightening: realization that music must be “invited,” not forced. Cost is felt in slow labor and the “profound despair” before breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of empathy as creative force emerges through action, not statement. Subtext in cracked sculpture: past failures become map for gentler making. Final chord answers the thematic question—sound returns through receptivity, not demand—without moralizing. Porcelain’s shift from tool to translator reweights earlier material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “symphonically minded understanding,” “filaments of its own heartstring fibers.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s patient focus—long sentences for slow work, then clipped release at the note. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Patterned elision (time marked by hedgehog) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense and musical—“latent song locked within the wood,” “single, pure note bloomed.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances craft or stakes. Metaphors are organic (wood as body, cracks as map). Rhythm accelerates subtly at climax—“Then, she waited. Nothing…”—before the release of sound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Premise—music after global silence—is fresh yet grounded in tactile craft. Transformation of discarded insulator and cracked sculpture into resurrection tools feels inevitable. Risk in quiet climax pays off: the chord is both literal sound and conceptual repricing of silence. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
