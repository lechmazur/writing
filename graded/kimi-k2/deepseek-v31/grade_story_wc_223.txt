<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s internal split—historian of tiny gestures vs. active saviour—is dramatised in one silent beat inside the gallery; the coat hand-off carries visible cost and crystallises a clamp on her future rest. yet the soldier disappears too fast to test relationship status, muting the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight situational lens: a coherent press of post-coup threat forces her from passive chronicler to complicit saviour. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—Cost paid in potential capture and the new moral reckoning.

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic uncanniness shapes every move; its echo turns Elara’s name-walk into performative elegy and gifts her the live intelligence that redefines the final act (the sobbing guard). Exquisite, selective sensory detail anchors space and limits options. Meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
 <comment>Single dominant stake—whether to keep collecting absences or intercede for the living—clarifies early. Escalation is situational: threat tightens when intercepted by the boy’s plea; off-screen patrols foreclose exit options. The final choice trades quiet scholarship for overt risk, carrying on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of witness versus agency emerges organically from Elara’s micro-choices and the mother-of-pearl board’s mute catalogue. Final image—the coat given, guard vanished—offers a wordless conceptual repricing rather than moral lecture, reweighting absence into possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Richly textured, omniscient-leaning interiority that still feels tightly filtered through Elara’s weaponised perception. Sentence rhythm subtly alters when pressure escalates; no register drift. Distinctive diction—“benevolently ruthless,” “luminous absence”—serves conceptual armour without sounding ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose carries high density—every line does character, image, and metaphor simultaneously. No looped stems or mixed metaphors; hyphen-hewn phrases accelerate breathlessly in the final beats. Only a faint inflation in early landscape sentence risks—hardly deflates closure. </comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crisis-historian macabre premise and pawn-less chess reliquary feel freshly synthesised; familiar coup setting gains specificity through architectural acoustic and Elara’s name-walking liturgy. Bold choice to make climax a silent gift rather than confrontation still lands with felt cost.</comment>
