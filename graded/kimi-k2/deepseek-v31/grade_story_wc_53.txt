<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—ambition calcified into regret—drives every micro-choice (turning the wheel, confronting the ghost). The embodied cost is palpable in her cracked knees and the final, silent negotiation. Yet the younger self’s smile feels slightly too neat, blunting the flaw’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the past is not reversed but reweighted, and the cost is the lifelong absence she now owns. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each click deepens regret until the final image crystallizes stance. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lagoon’s arrested motion and the camera wheel’s micro-crystals constrain every beat; the frozen carousel literally prevents escape. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s scavenger gaze. The final image recharges the “fractured stillness,” satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reckoning with wasted ambition—tightens with each spectral click until the last image forecloses nostalgia as refuge. Pressure is accumulative, not causal, but the deepening regret is legible and costly. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of ambition and absence; no moral is stated. The disposable camera’s final image reframes the entire quest as self-indictment. Subtext operates in the silence between Elaras, earning resonance without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and consistent: “buckled ceramic platform,” “thumb-grip daring her.” No dialogue, yet the prose carries scavenger idiom and lyric compression. Patterned elision (palimpsest of then/now) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. No loops or scaffold, though “spectral light” edges purple. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the final click, then the long fade of the ghost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The frozen-above-the-clouds carousel and memory-storing camera wheel synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric structure, but it heightens rather than obscures stakes. No derivative echoes.</comment>
