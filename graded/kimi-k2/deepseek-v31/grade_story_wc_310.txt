<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt—drives every micro-choice; the obsidian shard biting his palm embodies the cost of renouncing the coin of peace. Motive remains consistent yet intensifies under pressure, earning the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage from coin handling to prophecy reception to final self-offering. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his distilled doubt reweights the cosmos—cost is the blood on obsidian and the foregone silent future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory and the obsidian shard function as micro-setting and charged object, constraining the final choice; sensory detail is selective, filtered through Alaric’s reverent yet frantic touch. Spatial grounding is immediate and never drifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—single frequency to seed next universe—escalates via prophecy that retroactively threatens stagnation; the tightening choice between peace and struggle narrows to the obsidian’s cut. Cost is visceral and conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of choice versus predestination emerges organically from the backwards prophecy and the obsidian’s embrace of friction. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, reverent diction under cosmic scale; compression and patterned elision (“the universe breathing in”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Alaric’s alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“screaming chorus”) serve pressure without clutter. Rhythm modulates with urgency, culminating in the crystalline final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic heat-death scenario is refreshed by the backwards-prophecy twist and the refusal to choose a single virtue, embracing struggle as generative. Specificity of obsidian currency and spider-web coin makes the premise irreplaceable.</comment>
