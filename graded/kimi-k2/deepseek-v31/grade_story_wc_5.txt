<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and particular—her decade-long condensation of starlight, the grief-driven constellation of glacier-rose petals, the palm-up stillness that waits for the alembic’s pulse. Contradictory impulses (the flash-paper past vs. the reverent present) coexist in the same gesture; the final sealing burns away her remaining starlight, a visible cost that forecloses future maps. No stock labels; every beat is filtered through her sensory discipline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of ritual, cadence shift when the starlight flares, closure as Charged Poise. The map is not a literal victory but a crystallized grief now sealed in copper; the cost is the extinguished starlight and the irreversible consumption of her decade’s work. Causality holds: each slow arrangement of debris is a word that earns the final thrum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crater’s bowl, skeletal apple trees, and perpetual twilight are not backdrop but pressure—silence thick enough to hold breath, cold that dictates slow, reverent motion. The rusted tripod and spherical alembic are micro-settings that physically constrain her reach and timing. These details charge the final image: the orchard’s shadows merge with the glowing map, environment becoming text.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to render her mother’s death into a permanent, readable artifact. Escalation is not explosive but accumulative—each pattern tightens the emotional vise until the starlight flares and the cold fire seals the map. The cost is explicit: the alembic goes dark, the flash-paper is gone, her future cartographies are foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the alchemy of grief: permanence wrested from impermanence, love translated into metallurgical memory. The glacier-rose constellation and the star-inked valleys of absence reconfigure the heroic copper plate into a private elegy. No moralizing; the final image of latent copper and spent starlight invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distilled, tactile, and disciplined—every noun precise (alembic, lichen, bird bones), every verb weighted (“seep,” “thrum”). The lyric cadence mirrors her slowed pulse; patterned elision (“moving stillness”) is taught early and paid off in the resonant burn. No POV leakage; perception remains strictly hers, filtered through alchemical craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous: no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence layers craft, emotion, and world rule. The final “cold and brilliant” burn lands with rhythmic finality; no artifact dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of starlight cartography, flash-paper alchemy, and grief ritual is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The transformation of a heroic printing plate into a private memorial reframes familiar tropes of quest and artifact. Risky quietness and slow ritual pay off in a resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
