<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—hope versus the certainty of loss—is embodied in the diamond’s bite and her refusal to cast it away. The final endurance (“she stood her ground, weeping quietly”) crystallizes her as instrument rather than translator, a credible renunciation with felt cost. Backstory is woven through sensory cues (woven rug, river stone) that tilt present tactics. Minor slip: “terrified” label could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance shifts from translator to eternal conduit, cost paid on-page (“the canyon would sing…through her copper veins”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each texture-to-sound graft layers density until the final reweighting. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. Causality intact: because she succeeds, the curse reconfigures her fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but coercive force: the bone spires and wind turbulence literally shape the sonic grammar she must obey. Micro-setting (the diamond, her copper veins) constrains the final choice—veins become permanent conduit. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, narrowing to tactile memory under pressure. One minor spatial blur: “balcony of fused rib” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve a dead language—tightens when success amplifies loss. The flock-grammar discovery is the single meaningful escalation that reweights options; afterward, no escape remains. Cost is visceral: eternal haunting voiced through her body. Coincidence (flock convergence) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s preservation demands living sacrifice. The final image—copper veins as eternal antenna—reweights every prior texture without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (clenched fist around cursed stone) and sonic metaphor. No thematic drift; question of cultural survival answered by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is hushed yet precise, syntax mirroring Elara’s measured listening (“quietly articulate” made audible). Perceptual signature filters every detail through tactile memory and sonic obsession. No head-hopping; compression in climax (“wild, hopeful laugh”) tightens rhythm under stress. Distinct diction sustains lyric mode without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture or stakes. Metaphors are disciplined (diamond’s “sick heart,” canyon’s “cellolike groan”). No loops, no scaffold. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” territory—fits the elevated concept. Final line lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses ethnography, acoustics, and gothic curse into a singular myth. The flock-as-grammar device feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Risky choice—ending in eternal lament—pays off by charging the opening image of copper veins. No derivative echoes; synthesis is fresh and fully committed.</comment>
