<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oracle's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict is embodied in actions like smudging the illustration, and the final choice to expel the stone is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her desire to protect versus the burden of truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the stone's expulsion and recording, under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in "4.7 grams of sorrow" and the aurora dimming. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the weather station instruments and cold environment pressuring choices; the botanical illustration constrains action and charges the final image as a topographic map, integrating micro-setting into the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the oracle's agency, from internal weight to active externalization; cost is unmistakable in the expulsion and recorded sorrow, under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burden emerges through particulars like the seed and laurel imagery; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the stone's weight and sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "green ropes dragging violet scars," and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "tasting iron and pine resin," and peak beats maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, with a non-obvious synthesis of oracle and fault-tolerance; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
