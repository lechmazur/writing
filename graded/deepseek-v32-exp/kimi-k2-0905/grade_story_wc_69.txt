<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits and internal conflict, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to unlearn hatred intensifies, compelling her sacrificial choice, which is earned by prior causality with visible cost (she never sings again). The attribute "expectantly resigned" constrains her actions, showing credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through patterns of silence and subtraction to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Closure lands with felt cost in Mara's silence and the city's transformation, shaped by persistent constraints like the rosette's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet library setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., the library's rules and atmosphere pressure Mara's actions). Sensory details (cedar, candle smoke) are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of the circle of dust. The rosette functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes around unlearning hatred escalate through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, from humming to sacrificing her voice. Cost is legible in her permanent silence and the city's changed soundscape. One meaningful tightening (the braid lacking a root tone) forces a trade-off with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and harmony emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the rosette's use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the city's transformation, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical yet coherent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., "traveled stillness") is taught early and paid off at closure, enhancing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms that support the accumulative drive. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The concept of "vanishing arts" and subtracting noise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation of silence into agency is bold and coherent. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
