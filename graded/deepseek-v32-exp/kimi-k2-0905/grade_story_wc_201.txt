<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like bracing against the tree. The final removal of the strap is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with closure as Conceptual Repricing: the strap's fade to trash reweights mercy's asymptotic nature with cost. Orientation is clear early; pattern is taught and pays off. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through POV. Environment pressures tactics, as seen in the sap printing bruises and leaves vibrating. Specificity is purposeful and integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under accumulative lens, with protagonist's actions like bracing and removing the strap narrowing options. Cost is legible in the proprioceptive flare and strap's cooling. Dominant stake of finding mercy tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as asymptotic emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like placing the strap. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final digit and faded strap. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the trauma memory spasms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks. Sentences advance story without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality is high with non-obvious synthesis of ultraviolet penance and mathematics of mercy, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, verifiable detail anchors the premise.</comment>
