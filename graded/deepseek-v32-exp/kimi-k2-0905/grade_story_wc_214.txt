<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The janitor's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., speaking to star reflections) leading to an earned transformation. His grief and curiosity drive higher-stakes choices, and the final renunciation (leaving the lantern) has visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (trading the lantern's glow for "the softer lamp of his reopened chest"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the vision sequence tightening stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., the dome rotation sigh, telescope use). The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, and sensory details (e.g., "dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies") are filtered through the janitor's POV with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over grief and vulnerability) escalates through the janitor's agency in empathizing with meteors, culminating in a vision that forces a trade-off with cost. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, and the final choice forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges through particulars (e.g., the meteor's question, the janitor's weeping) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of the "heart that had learned to beat in open space."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, contemplative). Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic prose in the vision), and purposeful elision (e.g., the hush of the era) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "the universe felt safe enough to confess its fragility"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion accelerates key beats like the vision, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic and intimate elements with non-obvious specificity (e.g., janitor as empath). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
