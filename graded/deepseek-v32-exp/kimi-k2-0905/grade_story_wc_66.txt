<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mila's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a copyist, driving her actions consistently. Her micro-choices, like using rosin ink, reveal her values under pressure. However, emotional depth remains somewhat abstract, with embodied contradiction not fully dramatized in peak beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the dust amplifies stories, reconfiguring the narrative famine with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of imagery tightening toward the solstice. Orientation is clear early, and the final image charges prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the ember alcove and radio dial glow constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mila's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as using the alcove for amplification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mila's agency under the Accumulative lens, as decoding broadcasts and preparing for the solstice deepen stakes. Cost is legible when inspectors inhale the chord and are transformed. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the climax's conceptual cost slightly overshadows visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of storytelling as resistance emerges organically through images like rosin dust and encoded melodies, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dust whispering, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as fermatas smuggling meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mila, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory-driven prose. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the Ministry's ban) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within her lexicon, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative tension. Minor overwriting in figurative language exists but does not obscure closure; no significant loops or artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes dystopia and musical encoding with fresh, non-obvious angles, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like rosin ink and pirate broadcasts are irreplaceable, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
