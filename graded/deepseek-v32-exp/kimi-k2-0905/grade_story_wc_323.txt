<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Instructor's grief and determination are embodied through micro-choices like grinding the link; the boy's trembling question adds depth; final renunciation of the chain link earns cost with visible hollow ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as boy sights a path; causal lens holds through edge geometry teachings; cost legible in "missing link... ached like lungs remembering air."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic city pressures choices with coral towers and bioluminescence; chain link and spire act as micro-settings constraining navigation; sensory details like "rust" and "water" are POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of refusing disappearance escalate through instructor's agency in private lesson; cost felt in boy's "fingers bled rust" and instructor's hollow pocket; tightening leads to path discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of navigation as hope emerges from images like chain link unfolding horizons; ending reweights material without moralizing; subtext in "direction begins where fear ends."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV stable with poetic voice; perceptual signature distinct in "somber marvel" and "unfolded sky"; dialogue natural and goal-driven, as in boy's question about return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose rhythmic and concise with varied sentence lengths; figurative language like "slow planet" is purposeful; no loops or artifacts; high density in lines advancing story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of benthic sci-fi and literary meditation; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes; transformation of navigation tropes through alien geometry feels inevitable.</comment>
