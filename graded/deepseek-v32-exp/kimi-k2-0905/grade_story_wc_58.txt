<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final realization that she was her own first client is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (planting the thread as a seed), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the shadowed garden constraining choices and charging the final image (leaves spelling words). Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding healing) escalates through protagonist's agency in projecting presence, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the transformation and release of absences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence becoming presence emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates through implication and character complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and supports clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing obituaries for the living with the weft thread concept. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
