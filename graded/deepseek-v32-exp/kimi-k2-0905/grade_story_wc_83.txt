<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's grief and geode-driven motivation are concrete, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final dive is earned through prior causality, showing cost in the realization of harvesting unlived lives. However, minor diagnostic self-awareness in peaks ("bleak exhilaration") slightly reduces rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the dive altering the drone strike, a Charged Poise under the hybrid causal-accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through perturbation theory links. The final image of wedding guests reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating observatory and geode constraining choices (e.g., smashing circuit breakers alters wind patterns). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image with the desert's embrace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in hunting potential, driven by causal links under the hybrid lens. Cost is legible in geode fragmentation and the realization of harvesting grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dive forecloses other options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief and potential emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dive and unused potential pooling, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor register drift in "bleak exhilaration" slightly reduces peak-beat immediacy. Propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of geode magic and perturbation theory, transformed through specific character stakes. Risk-taking in structure heightens coherence, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight with no derivative echoes.</comment>
