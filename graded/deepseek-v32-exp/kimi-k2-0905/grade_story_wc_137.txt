<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from skeptic to participant is earned through embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as staggering back then courageously choosing to listen, with visible cost in her renunciation of pure reason for shared connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and closure lands with Mara releasing the tile—a decisive change fueled by entangled memories, costing her initial goal but gaining a crowded tenderness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details—whale breaths, salt, jasmine—weave through the tower setting, which constrains choice via the astrolabe and tile, charging the final image of humming stones that only the kind can detect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic duty to personal participation as memories flood Mara; her agency in aligning the astrolabe and transcribing for the choir narrows options with felt cost in abandoning publishable proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection over skepticism emerges through particulars like shared memories and whale song, offering a resonant non-literal answer in the transcribed chord without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV maintains a distinct lyrical voice, with perceptual signature in Mara's skepticism and rhythmic prose that heightens pressure; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "unheard symphony" is consistent and purposeful, sustaining momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skeptic, magic tile, and whale migration creates a fresh, inevitable arc; risk-taking in lyrical style deepens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific detail.</comment>
