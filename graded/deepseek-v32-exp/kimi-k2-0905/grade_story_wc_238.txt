<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exorcist's motives are clear and rooted in guilt; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., apology "clung to her tongue like rosin." Final choice to speak instead of using perfume is earned by prior hesitation, with cost in the ghost's fading. Sister's ghost is less developed but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the empty bottle and lilac bloom, reconfiguring silence as forgiven. Induced currents and orchard destruction tighten pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: archive guides choice via currents and manuscripts; orchard's impending cutting charges the final image. Sensory details (dust motes, iron filings) reflect POV and urgency, constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of reconciliation escalate through emotional buildup: finding the composition, uncorking perfume, speaking apology. Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens; cost is felt in the release and orchard's fall, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and silence emerges through particulars like the rest and tie notation, not statement. Ending offers non-literal answer with the lilac bloom and echo, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, e.g., "dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios." Elision (induced currents) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports closure, e.g., "fractured into thirty-two facets." No muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of exorcism and memory; emotional specificity avoids tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight with forgiven silence.</comment>
