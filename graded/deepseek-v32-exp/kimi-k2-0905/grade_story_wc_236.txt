<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from loss to revelation. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like tears blurring the loupe, and micro-choices such as rotating the screw reveal her values. The final renunciation—accepting meaning without scent—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her altered perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the water clock's "wet newborn gasp" reconfiguring Mira's understanding of loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to the epiphany. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the "trembling calm" and her pocketing the screw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the water clock shop and fog creating atmosphere that mirrors internal states. The screw as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, influencing Mira's realization. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing emotional terrain without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, as her interaction with the screw deepens stakes from personal loss to universal meaning. Cost is unmistakable in her tears and the secret rotation of the screw, foreclosing her old path and embracing a new role as storyteller.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the screw's story reweights loss as a map for emotional terrain. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as Mira recognizes that "maps are drawn as much by loss as by landmark." Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical voice that reflects Mira's perceptual bias toward tactile and emotional details. Rhythm and diction control under pressure, such as "reading between lines only the heart can translate," enhance coherence. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "screw became a spindle." Clarity and propulsion remain strong even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of aromatherapy, horology, and midwifery, transformed through specific character stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical introspection heightens coherence without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
