<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her existence through collected stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "her heart hammered against the death certificate"). Her final choice to invert the poison's purpose is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old identity with visible cost. Minor abstraction in phrases like "texture of memories" doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Mara's act of repurposing the poison label reweights memory preservation with cost (her name dispersing, voices garbling sensors). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered fragments to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains choices (e.g., climbing stairs to find the archive) and charges the final image with the stamped label. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "sodium light," "salt shadow"). Setting pressures tactics and evolves consistently with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: discovering the poison label, meeting the captain, and repurposing it to preserve memories. Cost is visible in her renunciation of her name and the act of spreading voices. Dominant stake (proving existence) tightens meaningfully through these beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically through images like collected fragments and the poison label, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's act, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, sensory language (e.g., "tidal hush," "rusted walls"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity (e.g., "containers groaned like whales"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes erased histories and port city setting with non-obvious ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the barcode tattoo and poison label. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
