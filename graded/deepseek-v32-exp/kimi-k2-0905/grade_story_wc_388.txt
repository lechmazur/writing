<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her past as a debunker, driving her to hunt truth. Her internal conflict is embodied when she almost drops the diamond but persists, showing contradictory impulses. The final choice to hang the diamond is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as she faces the shame of lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—hanging the diamond causes the orchard to rot—with felt cost legible in "truth accelerating rot." The causal lens holds strong, with because/therefore linkages from her actions to the outcome. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the diamond's curse shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "radioactive dust hissed" and the orchard constraining choices. The environment charges the final image as the apples brown, and the stillpoint acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Marisol's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. lies escalates through Marisol's agency, such as reassembling letters and hanging the diamond. Cost is unmistakable in the playback of lies and the orchard's decay. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges organically from events, with subtext in the diamond's curse and Marisol's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by broadcasting lies, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through scene work, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature like "clicked like an angry cicada." Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the stillpoint) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register shifts; diction matches the character's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor density in peak beats slightly limits clarity. Sentence-level propulsion advances story without sluggishness, and the final image is charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing post-apocalyptic and cursed diamond tropes with specific details like the stillpoint and shredded letters. Emotional truth is compelling, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
