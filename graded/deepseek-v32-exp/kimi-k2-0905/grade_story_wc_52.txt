<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the grain, starting the carve) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her motivation to contain memory drives the narrative, and the final decision to carve again is an earned endurance with visible cost. Internal conflict between remembrance and acceptance is dramatized through concrete actions and sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of the carving as "a sentinel of here and gone." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with memory patterns escalating through the carving process. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality remains intact without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the rain-beaded skylight loft filters light for the carving, and the workbench, latch, and carving blank charge the final image. Sensory details (sawdust smell, rain light) are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in carving, tightening the stake of managing grief. Cost is legible in the "rust-hued peace" and the jar of shavings, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. One meaningful deepening occurs as the carving progresses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as both cage and key emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in gestures like whispering commands. Complexity is embraced through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific (e.g., "grain swirl like the mane"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., flashbacks) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "steam ghosting the loft"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats, and clarity is maintained even in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of grief and art through specific details (lion tamer, carving). Tropes are transformed, and risk-taking in structure (integrated flashbacks) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
