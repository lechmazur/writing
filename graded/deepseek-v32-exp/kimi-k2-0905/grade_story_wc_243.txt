<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with clear motivation rooted in personal loss; the archivist's final choice to plant the locket is earned by prior causality and micro-choices under pressure, such as sketching with care and sacrificing the locket, with visible cost in the empty wrist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with the locket planting and daughter scene reweighting memory's persistence; cost is legible in the archivist's loss, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the jetty, ink, and locket constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt-rimmed plank" and "gulls laughing" reflect POV bias and mirror internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, as contractors' arrival pressures faster sketching, leading to the locket sacrifice with visible cost; stakes in preserving memory tighten meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through particulars like the locket and boy's story, with subtext in braided laughter; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, such as "wind carried haunted euphoria"; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., "proximate causes") is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "ink blooming like bruised violets" is coherent and purposeful, and closure clarity is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of archivist and memory preservation, with specific details transforming tropes; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
