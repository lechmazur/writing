<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; final choice to crush the shard is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as seen in her confession and reimagination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change and conceptual repricing as Aurelia dissolves and seeds a new civilization; inferred Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with cost legible in her dissolution and the archaeologist's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., mirrored halls amplify time storms, forcing mirror-covering; sensory details like "obsidian wall" and "velvet drapes" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Hybrid lens: from seeking shard to covering mirrors to crushing it, narrowing options with cost (Aurelia's dissolution); dominant stake (reimagining civilization) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, e.g., shard reflecting lost futures and banned mirrors; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as new civilization buds from verses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic diction and syntax reflect Aurelia's mind, e.g., "We are the echo learning to shout back"; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood," advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of baroque asteroid, time storms, and revolutionary reimagination feels inevitable; risk-taking with poetic language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific choices.</comment>
