<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final choice to step into the workshop is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the healed key and rhythmic closure. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Rowan heals the key and enters the workshop, with cost legible in the "heart finding rhythm" click. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details integrated into action; the hall of mirrors and key constrain choices and charge the final image. Environment pressures tactics, such as the mirrors storing better versions, enhancing specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from gear failure to key healing, with cost visible in the door's sigh and restored rhythm. Dominant stake in repair rhythm tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair and forgiveness emerges through events and images, not direct statement; the final image of overlapping ticks offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in mirror reflections deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with poetic precision and stable POV; perceptual signature is strong, and rhythmic control under pressure heightens stakes. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of locksmith, eclipses, and mirrors feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific choices transform tropes through character and world logic.</comment>
