<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion like the pen responding to emotional charge. Her motivation to thresh meaning intensifies under pressure, compelling the high-stakes choice to unbend history. The final action to plant new seeds is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in station power dimming. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as confidence flickering while uncertainty steadies her hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the station lights dimming and gravity slackening. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density increase in imagery and pattern break leading to resonance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The persistent constraint of the gravitational anomaly shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful, like the gravitational anomaly tugging at bones and the viewport, filtered through Mira's POV. The pen and anomaly constrain choices and charge the final image, with the pen etching absence that glows. Sensory selection reflects urgency, narrowing to immediacies under stress. Micro-setting elements are integrated into action and alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as the anomaly flares and pen vibration prompts her to unbend events. Cost is unmistakable in power borrowed and gravity slackening during rewriting. The dominant stake of meaning-making tightens through a decisive choice that forecloses confusion. Protagonist alteration is earned, with visible price altering future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as uncertainty being the truest coordinate, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the revised scroll and seeds as early, not wrong. Subtext operates in imagery, like the pen thirsting for ink as metaphor. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's poetic, professional voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand." Purposeful elision, such as the pen's dry scratching, is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, as in "filaments shimmer like spider silk." Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of celestial interpretation and history-editing, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, as with contingent relationships. Emotional truth avoids generic templates through specific detail like the meteoric iridium pen. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
