<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of honesty, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied when she almost confronts but withdraws, and her final choice to show the film is earned with visible cost. The resolution forecloses resentment with a felt cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; the ticket leads to eavesdropping and the film projection, with closure as a decisive change restoring trust. Cost is legible in "the ambiguously clear weight of trust," and the lens constraint shapes tactics. Quick test met with persistent price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the forecourt and booth constraining choices. The lens and film charge the final image, and sensory details like "wet stone" and "dust floated like plankton" are filtered through Mira's POV. Quick test passed as environment shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust escalates through Mira's agency—eavesdropping reveals the plan, and her choice to project the film narrows options with cost. Pressure coheres under causal lens, and the final trade-off is legible. Quick test met with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges through actions and images, not statement; the final doodle of an "open lock" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silences and the film's apology. No moralizing, and complexity lingers. Quick test satisfied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "feeling the paper still warm." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., eavesdropping) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; quick test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "snow fall upward" is coherent, and propulsion is clear. No scaffolding or register drift in peak beats. Quick test passed with zero muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of cryptic doodles leading to film apology, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of trust tropes through specific choices. Quick test met with risk distinction.</comment>
