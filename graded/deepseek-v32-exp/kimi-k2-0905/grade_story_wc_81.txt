<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trace honest origins is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like extinguishing the lantern. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "dappled resolve—light and shadow alternating inside her like breathing." Her final decision to rewrite the index is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "private pressure keeping the false history at bay." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as Mara resolves to remember pre-submergence topography. Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages: blackout enables stamp use, leading to glyph discovery. Orientation is clear within first sentences. Cost is legible in "reclaimed stillness inside her held," and persistent constraints (stamp, indentations) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: flooded library, blackout, and rising water constrain Mara's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause." The stamp as micro-setting charges the final image by revealing the street grid. Environment directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under causal lens. Key tightening occurs when she extinguishes the lantern, forcing the phosphorescent reveal. Cost is legible in her resolve to rewrite the index, foreclosing compliance with false history. No coincidence; escalation is driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges organically from particulars like the stamp's glyph mirroring the street grid. Subtext operates through implication, e.g., indentations as "silent witness." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech." No moralizing; earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature shaped by Mara's profession. Voice is lyrical and consistent, e.g., "reclaimed stillness became almost solid." No head-hopping; elision (blackout) is taught and pays off. Prose reflects her state under stress, as when she works by touch in darkness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "dripping from chandeliers like slow applause." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the phosphorescent reveal. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dystopian truth-seeking with specific details like the bronze card catalogue and algae tubes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, e.g., stamp as map revealed through darkness. Emotional truth avoids templates; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
