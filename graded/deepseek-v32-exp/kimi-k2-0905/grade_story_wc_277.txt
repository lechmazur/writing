<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cordelia's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like fitting the nib and writing phrases. Her internal conflict is shown through actions rather than summary, and the final renunciation of the orbit is earned by prior causality. The trait "devotedly observant" anchors her choices, but slight lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as the orbit cracks, driven by causal linkages under the inferred lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "feeling the empty space where gravity had once insistently tugged." The rosewood nib acts as a persistent constraint, shaping tactics and the final image without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly described with sensory details like "starlight dripped" and constrains choices through the dome's projection mechanism. The rosewood nib functions as a micro-setting that charges the closure when it splinters. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cordelia's agency under the causal lens, as her writing with the nib directly causes the orbit to shudder and crack. The dominant stake of regret is signaled early and tightens through her interventions, with visible cost in the broken nib and reconfigured orbit. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the orbit representing regret and the proof by contradiction method. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "The story continues," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the broken nib, avoiding explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Cordelia, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic phrases like "gears groaned like old editors." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the exchange with Dr. Orlan. Rhythm and diction remain controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "shards became starlings scattering into night." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes astronomy and regret through a fresh, non-obvious angle, with the proof by contradiction method shaping the narrative arc. Risk-taking in structural choices, like the observatory as a metaphorical playground, heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
