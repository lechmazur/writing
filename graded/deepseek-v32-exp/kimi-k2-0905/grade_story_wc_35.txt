<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; her gift/curse drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final renunciation of sandpapering for transformation is earned by prior causality. The reversal where she gives her memories to the coral shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, with visible cost in her changed gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the fortress "humming" reweighting grief's role; cost is legible in Marisol's reversed gift and the desert's shifted patterns. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the coral's memories forcing the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the desert fortress and coral pavilion constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt of forgotten storms" and "bioluminescent memory" are purposefully filtered through Marisol's POV. The environment directly shapes the climax where the pavilion's remorse alters her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marisol's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her decision to "subsume" and give her memories to the coral tightens stakes and forecloses her initial goal with visible cost. The dominant stake of transforming grief deepens through a meaningful cadence shift in the pavilion scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coral's "slow weeping" and Marisol's gift reversal, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on balancing grief without moralizing. The final image of "sorrow that could shelter life" reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Marisol's chef background and memory-tasting; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the coral responded... warm amber." No head-hopping, and purposeful elision (e.g., "unspoken dream") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "fossilized into something that could cut" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and peak beats avoid muddle, though minor density in descriptions may slightly slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-tasting, oceanic grief, and desert setting feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like "coral icebound pavilion" transform familiar tropes through grounded, irreplaceable choices.</comment>
