<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation evolves credibly from learning to becoming the keeper, with embodied emotions like the seal's warmth and the gargoyle's speech. Contradictory impulses are shown in the "agreed upon lies" and the tutor's revelation. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the narrator's acceptance of the role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the narrator becomes the new keeper. Cost is legible in the tutor's vanishing and the building's sigh. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of lies and seals pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, such as using the seal on the gargoyle, and charges the final image with the rooftop garden and meteor shower. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the potted rosemary and limestone whisper. Micro-setting elements like the seal actively shape the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through the seal's use and the tutor's revelation, driving protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the narrator's transformation and the tutor's dissipation. Dominant stake of truth vs. lies tightens meaningfully with each beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and lies emerges through concrete images like the seal imprint "stay" and the building's fatigue. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, deepening the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure, such as the meteor shower in Latin hexameter, enhances clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "meteors now fell in perfect Latin hexameter." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dead tutors, building languages, and agreed lies feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the desk seal and rooftop garden anchor freshness, and the premise is fully committed to.</comment>
