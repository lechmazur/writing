<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as vaulting from the pier and using the scrimshaw, revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final decision to detach the island is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of the old ground. Interior contradictions, like tenderness without danger feeling foreign, are shown in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the island detaches and transforms, redefining freedom with felt cost—"the old ground dissolved into foam." The Accumulative drive lens holds, with pattern shifts in density and imagery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the sublittoral fringe where Lira descends, pressuring her actions. The scrimshaw as a recurring object charges the final image when offered to the sea. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from calling the whale to urging detachment, with cost legible in the island's dissolution. The dominant stake of freedom versus attachment tightens through a meaningful deepening that forecloses old paths. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the scrimshaw embodying plundered bones cradling gentleness, offering a resonant non-literal answer to freedom. Subtext operates through implication, like Lira's declaration "I'm not your guilt; I'm your exit wound," without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable single POV and perceptual signature evident in Lira's biased observations. Rhythmic control under pressure, such as the whale's call "vibrating through sole and soul," supports momentum. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "timbers lifting like wings," is coherent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of a disappearing island and combative tenderness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The premise transforms familiar tropes through specific lived detail, like the gunpowder fizzling into salt. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
