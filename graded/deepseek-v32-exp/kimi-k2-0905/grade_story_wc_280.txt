<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "words tasting of iron curtain weights"). Micro-choices, like tying the thread, reveal values with cost. Final bow feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the ghost's sharpened outline and endless encore. Orientation is clear early, and the maze rearrangement coheres with the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the orchard garden pressures the ghost's actions, and sensory details (e.g., "nicotia released chords of perfume") are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by ghost's agency under Accumulative lens; stake of seeking possibility tightens through coin use and echoes, with cost felt in the "endless encore." No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and art emerges through images and events, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the orchard's waiting presence. Subtext operates in Lila's dialogue and the coin's echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., synesthetic descriptions like "citrine applause"). Rhythmic control under pressure; elision (e.g., time fractures) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and serves momentum, though minor overwriting in dense imagery doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with unique elements (tarot coin, synesthesia); risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
