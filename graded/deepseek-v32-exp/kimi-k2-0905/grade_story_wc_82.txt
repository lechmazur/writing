<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "tears evaporated into minor constellations"). The final choice to transform grief into cranes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in using her own dream spark, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (hands smell only of tea), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., tea leaves chiming) filtered through POV. The floating garden and basilica constrain choices and charge the final image, as the tea leaf becomes a chimney, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of processing grief escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency (folding cranes), with cost legible in the "last spark of her own dream." One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through particulars (e.g., cranes becoming lanterns), not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, sensory-rich voice). Rhythm and diction control under pressure are exemplary, and any elision (e.g., shadow detachment) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "grief hardened into obsidian"), and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through non-obvious synthesis of dream recording and origami, transforming grief tropes with specific world-building. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
