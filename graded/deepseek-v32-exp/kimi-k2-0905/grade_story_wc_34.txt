<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and intensifies under pressure, evidenced by her confrontation with the echo and the decisive release of petals. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "tasting metal on her tongue" during the echo's accusation. The final choice to open the flower press completely is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of needs into communal static. Contradictory impulses act in scene through the echo, reinforcing the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the release of petals reweights unspoken needs into belonging, symbolized by the glyph "an open mouth curved into a listening ear." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through imagery and pattern breaks. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The persistent constraint of the thunder timeframe shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the misty courtyard and lightning-slag stylus constraining choices and charging the closure as the courtyard becomes an instrument. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "the scent of centuries-old roses rolled out, mixing with ozone." Micro-setting elements like the flower press bolt plate evolve through use, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere. The environment actively pressures Lyra's actions, such as the stones warming under her knees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the Accumulative lens, from painting graffiti to confronting the echo and releasing the petals, with cost legible in the transformation. The dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options, foreclosing the path of imprisonment in pigment. Pressure coheres and grows, culminating in the communal release, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the graffiti encoding loneliness and the final glyph offering a non-literal answer to communal belonging. Subtext operates through implication, e.g., the echo representing internal conflict, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the resonant image of the glyph, avoiding abstraction and embracing complexity. Earned wisdom arises from Lyra's specific struggle and release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Lyra's poetic perceptual signature filtering the world through her urgency and bias. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, even under pressure, with experimental elements like "driftingly alert" taught and legible. Dialogue with the echo is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression, such as "ghost in code," is paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "indigo vines that spelled the syllables of loneliness." Syntax accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the moths' manifestation. Minor overwriting in dense imagery does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes original elements organically, with the core premise of encoding unspoken needs into graffiti feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specifics like the flower press bolt plate are irreplaceable. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices, such as the echo as inner conflict, avoids derivative patterns. Conceptual integrity is maintained through full commitment to the premise.</comment>
