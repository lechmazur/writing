<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The realization that the spark is her own is earned through prior causality, and the final dispersal forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal conflict is shown in scene, and the change is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing, as she disperses into the aurora, costing her life to preserve others' sparks. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building to realization. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the dispersal image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The skyborne grotto and mirror pool constrain choices and charge the final image, as she steps into the pool to disperse. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing sparks before oblivion is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase. Her agency in infusing the chip and stepping into the pool drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in her dispersal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as shield against forgetting and self-sacrifice emerges from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her becoming the river, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Prose reflects the character's mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of elements, with risk-taking in lyrical structure that heightens stakes. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, and originality is integrated through character and closure.</comment>
