<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lys's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a chaste courtesan, with embodied emotion (e.g., "pulse feel like betrayal") and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to remain chaste by choice is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with accumulative/textural drive, building to a decisive change where Lys unlocks the core and frees the city. Closure lands with cost ("freedom, too, can be a terrifying lullaby"), and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (e.g., "prism sanctuary rose like a frozen teardrop") and constrains choices, as the sanctuary's facets and courtyard snow directly shape Lys's actions and the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (defying conformity) are signaled early and escalate through Lys's agency in untangling echoes, with cost legible in the courtyard's transformation and her burned contract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of liberation vs. conformity emerges through images and events, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the "alarming serenity" of freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control (e.g., "bodily poetic vibrating the mercury tears"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "alarming serenity that made her pulse feel like betrayal") but no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (e.g., harvest of echoes, prism sanctuary) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
