<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—the dream captured, palette cracked, and voices restored—under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the light implosion and cipher spelling. The persistent constraint of longing shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago and coral shelves pressure choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mireya's POV. The setting constrains actions, such as the sand ridge responding to politeness and the horizon being movable. Vivid, purposeful imagery integrates into action, avoiding generic description. Environment evolution is causal, enhancing stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mireya's agency under the accumulative lens, with painting and photographing tightening options toward the dream capture. Cost is unmistakable in the palette cracking and air thinning, forcing a trade-off. Dominant stake of restoring voices is signaled early and deepens through her actions.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold.
