<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied emotion; final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she seals the hourglass, accepting the cycle of loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as she chooses to stay; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the living bridge garden constraining choices and charging the final image; details like the hawthorn keystone are integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in a choice with clear cost; the dominant stake of memory and time is tightened through her journey in the maze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time emerges through particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of accepting dissolution, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., time shifts) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative language is purposeful and supports propulsion, especially in peak beats like the halo fragment's glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
