<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Naram-bel's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict (e.g., fear of empirical irony versus longing). His final choice to become the watcher is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his disappearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Naram-bel's transformation) with felt cost (physical disappearance and covenant terms). Causal drive lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from tile use to sanctum opening. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV, with sensory details (e.g., "dust floated like pale constellations"). The magic square tile as a micro-setting object constrains choices and charges the final image, altering tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sealing a covenant) escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency (e.g., drawing schematics, using the tile). Cost is unmistakable in Naram-bel's renunciation and disappearance, foreclosing paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (mathematics outlasting empire) emerges through events and images without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Naram-bel's transformation, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (astronomer's mathematical lens). Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "dusky harmony of encrypted devotion"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "dust that refused to settle—empirical irony given form"). No obscurity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of Babylonian setting, mathematical mysticism, and lyrical tone feels inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
