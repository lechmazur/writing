<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in rebellion, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between individuality and entanglement is dramatized, and the final choice to teach harmony is earned by prior causality with visible cost when memories drift free.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of her as "conductor emeritus." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the garden's pattern teaching paying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as the lagoon dissolving identity, and details are integrated into action with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, through drumming and wading into the lagoon, narrowing options with cost when memories loosen. The dominant stake of reclaiming identity tightens meaningfully, and the cost is felt in the release of foreign heartbeats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of identity and harmony emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like drumming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "auroral veil" reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and controlled elision. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any experimental elements like patterned diction are taught and pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no major artifacts harming closure. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "ghost notes of lullabies") is balanced by clarity and propulsion, and figurative language coheres without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and lyrical elements with freshness, transforming tropes through specific details like entangled memories. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
