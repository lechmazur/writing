<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and atonement, with embodied emotion like "loosened grief slipping down her cheeks." Interiority is concrete, and her micro-choices under pressure, such as using the chrysalis as a mold, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Mara transforming grief into connection through the sculptures. The cost is legible in the final image of strangers touching the shells, and the lens holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "water slapping rock" filtered through Mara's POV. The environment mirrors internal states and supplies the key insight from river foam patterns, making it indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, from insight to creating sculptures, with cost legible in her effort and the emotional payoff. The dominant stake of internal conflict with grief tightens meaningfully, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming separation into connection emerges through events and images like the chrysalis and river foam, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the sculptures creating "tributaries of connection," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with lyrical, scientific diction reflecting Mara's mind. POV is stable and single, with rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the description of the resin "singing at 440 hertz." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, like "fossilized moonlight," and syntax varies naturally. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry with grief and art is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
