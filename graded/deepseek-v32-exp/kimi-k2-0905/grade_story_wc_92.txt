<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the "cradle of sparks." Micro-choices under pressure, like using the graphite and bridging terminals, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to spark revolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (fort unlocked, barges free) and felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the blackout constraint shapes tactics. The lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the ending image of drifting barges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "cool iron" and "bruised violet sky" that pressure choices. The blackout and fort environment constrain tactics, aiding the conspirators. The quill holder and sundial function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with stakes signaled early (silent revolution). Cost is legible in risks taken, such as Garnet deceiving Voss. One meaningful tightening occurs when the timer is set, foreclosing options and leading to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, such as "cradle of sparks" representing rebellion. Subtext operates in implication, like the quill holder symbolizing rewritten borders. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Garnet, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet precise, modulating with pressure. Elision is taught and paid off, such as the coded angles leading to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "twilight itself had swallowed their sparks") but no major artifacts or loops. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of rebellion tropes through specific details like the quill holder and sundial. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
