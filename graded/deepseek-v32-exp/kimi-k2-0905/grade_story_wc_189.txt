<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chronicler's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as offering the jade cicada, earning the reconciliation. The daughter's hesitant arrival adds relational crucible, though her motivation is slightly less detailed, but this fits the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the slow reweaving of stories; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and the jade cicada as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the final image of the tide erasing footprints but changing the stone charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly specific with sensory details (limestone ribs glowing, water dripping) and constrains choices, charging the final image. The pool and cicada function as micro-settings that alter tactics and deepen the theme of time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (reconciliation) escalate through accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency (inviting light, offering cicada), with cost legible in the emotional exchange. Under the textural lens, the cadence shift with the daughter's arrival reweights options, though the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time, transition) emerges through particulars like the cicada and tidal metaphors, with subtext in gestures; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as seen in the daughter's realization about silt layering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (observant, tangential), and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. The chronicler's voice is consistent, and minimal dialogue carries subtext, as in the final metaphor about the pool holding the ocean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting risks in peak beats (e.g., "a living diagram of how to move through pain without breaking" leans slightly declarative). No major artifacts; rhythm varies purposefully, and closure clarity is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada, and tangential method feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, as in the silent rehearsal of union and departure.</comment>
