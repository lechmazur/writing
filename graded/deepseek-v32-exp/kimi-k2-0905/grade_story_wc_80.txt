<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as wincing at the gull's cry. The final choice to seal notes is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, e.g., her stoicism versus sensitivity, driving higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as she walks away without looking back, reconfigured under an accumulative/textural lens. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the submerged pavilion shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the submerged pavilion constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "slick granite coping" and "rusted chains" are selective and purposeful. The environment pressures Mara's actions, such as wading and placing notes, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with each note placement deepening the emotional stake and narrowing options. The cost is legible in her actions, like wrestling a stone, and the final image reweights the dominant stake of documenting abandoned dreams with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence and abandoned dreams emerges coherently from events and images, not direct statement; subtext operates in gestures and notes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of future scholars, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent and poetic, reflecting her character; elision is taught and paid off, such as the inkwell's reprise, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Minor hairline slip in slight overwriting in peaks, e.g., "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light," but no figurative muddle obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a surveyor placing notes in a submerged pavilion is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Elements serve character and conflict organically, with freshness in emotional specificity.</comment>
