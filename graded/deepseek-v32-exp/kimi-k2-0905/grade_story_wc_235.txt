<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses like jealousy of past selves and grief for an unlived life driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—letting the scroll vanish—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the settlement of chaos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the scroll's erasure reweights time as a wheel, with cost legible in "felt the chaos inside her settle into something almost bearable." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of reflection and image pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like cedar smoke and snowflakes dissolving words filtering through POV. The mountain cabin and scroll pressure choices, and the environment charges the final image of erasure as continuation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in internal conflict about time escalates through accumulative density—scroll messages, grave vision, eagle flight—driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the forfeiture of the scroll and acceptance of cyclical time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as wheel versus ladder emerges through particulars like the scroll and grave, with subtext in gestures (e.g., sparks as words). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "erasure is also a form of continuation" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, introspective voice under pressure, e.g., "wind sounded like a page turning." Rhythmic control and purposeful elision (e.g., time folds) enhance coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "snowflakes landed like white ink," and propulsion advances story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lucid dreaming and time confusion with specific, grounded details like the birch bark scroll. Risk-taking in non-linear narrative heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative tropes.</comment>
