<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in personal grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her spatial gift and internal conflict are dramatized, and the final choice to merge the Lucs is earned by prior causality. Minor diagnostic phrasing in peak beats slightly reduces score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the merging of the Lucs, and the causal drive lens holds tightly. Orientation is clear early, and the topology fold concept is taught and pays off. Persistent constraints like the laser pointer shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices via permeable barriers and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, from laser discoveries to the Luc encounter. Cost is legible in the merging's emotional weight, and stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and closure emerges through particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the merged Luc. Subtext in "exit routes from grief" deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice blends poetic and technical elements. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., topology folds) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with purposeful figurative language. No major artifacts or loops; rhythm supports pressure, though minor density in peak beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes topology folds with grief resolution in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes, and specifics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
