<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., feeling ambitions erode). Final renunciation (breaking the camera wheel) is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the ghost's contempt and the protagonist's offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing (shared erosion) with cost legible in the dissolution of images. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (chronological confusion) shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image of the ghost dissolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (kinetic lagoon, obsidian horse) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered (e.g., cloudwater hissing like syllables). Environment actively pressures the negotiation, altering tactics and deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (breaking the camera wheel, speaking fragments), reweighting stakes with cost. Dominant stake (internal reconciliation) tightens through shared erosion, foreclosing options with visible price in emulsified dreams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions emerges through particulars (camera wheel, ghost) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the ticket stubs revealing regret as backward empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating under pressure (e.g., "regret is just empathy traveling backwards"). No head-hopping; elision (chronological confusion) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats (e.g., "fractured stillness"). Sentence-level propulsion advances story without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (ghost, carousel) with fresh, non-obvious angle; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Transformation through specific details (disposable camera wheel) feels inevitable, and closure commits fully to its implications.</comment>
