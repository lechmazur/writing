<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to salvage something pure; her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "the first unguarded expression," and her final choice to carry the knowledge is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the glacier closes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "the glacier began to close" and the gained knowledge; the accumulative/textural lens holds, with events linking through causality and pattern; orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a single POV.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "crevasse-blue ice" and the glacier constraining choices; the snow globe charges the final image, and the environment shapes tactics, such as pressing against ice walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marrow's agency under the accumulative lens, from dreaming to retrieving the globe, with cost legible in the glacier sealing; stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the pace is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the snow globe representing purity; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "even wreckage can cradle light," avoiding moralizing and deepening through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable POV and perceptual signature like "borrowed starlight"; diction is controlled, and any elision is taught and paid off, though minor ornate moments slightly temper rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and supports clarity, as in "planetarium of collective sorrow," and propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesizes elements uniquely, with risk-taking in lyric style; the core concept of dream cameos feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity anchors emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
