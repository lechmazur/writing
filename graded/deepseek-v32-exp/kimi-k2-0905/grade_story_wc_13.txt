<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of future minutes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she offers the pendant, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when time snaps taut and the pendant seals, under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the giant's nap timeframe tightening decisions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the canal flow reversal and living wisteria bridge reimbursing seconds. The rooftop canal system pressures tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency, such as choosing the left canal and offering the pendant, with cost legible when she surrenders future minutes. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, like the interrupted cadence and echoes, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the doorway of sound, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature reflected in rhythmic prose. Purposeful compression, such as time shifts, is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, as in "ripples climbing backward like silverfish," without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh concepts like time-sculpting cadences and echo aviaries, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
