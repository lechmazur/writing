<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her trained ear identifying footsteps. Her motivation intensifies through the discovery, and the final realization about the labyrinth's purpose is earned by prior causality. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mira reconfigures her understanding of the labyrinth's acoustic purpose, with cost legible in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to climax, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words. The persistent constraint of whispers and maps shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting of the labyrinth and geomagnetic storm is vivid and selective, constraining choices and charging the final image with the resonant chamber. Sensory detail is purposeful, such as the metallic whispers and violet ribbons, filtered through Mira's professional bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the complex environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from the stranger's arrival to the whisper challenge unlocking the chamber. The dominant stake of proving the whisper network tightens meaningfully, with cost visible in the reconfiguration of Mira's maps and understanding. No coincidental resolutions undermine pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the zodiac coin and whisper network, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about quiet voices traveling farthest. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the key responding to sound, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's professional observations. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in whispers. Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the maritime code) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as the description of the chamber pulsing with the storm's rhythm. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in the acoustic machine concept that heightens stakes. Specific details like the triangular key and zodiac coins are irreplaceable and transform tropes through grounded choices. Bold execution supports coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
