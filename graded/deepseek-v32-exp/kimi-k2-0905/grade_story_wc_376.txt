<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurelia's characterization is deeply integrated with her profession and flaw (skin blistering at falsehoods), driving her to seek truth; her loneliness and micro-choices (piecing the map, confessing) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure, and the final change is earned with visible cost in her confession and the vines' response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from map discovery to cathedral meeting; closure is a decisive change (Aurelia becoming postmaster) with felt cost in the fear of running out of words, and the map fragments persistently constrain tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (filtration veils, vines wilting at lies); the greenhouse city and toxic sky constrain Aurelia's journey and charge the final image with the vines lifting at truth, demonstrating environmental influence on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (finding honesty in deception) escalate through Aurelia's agency in piecing the map and journeying to the cathedral; cost is legible in the shared fear and the vines' reaction, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges organically from particulars (map phrase, lost letters, confession) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through the image of irrigating the city with honesty, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is clear in Aurelia's biased noticing (e.g., "ink began to feel like a lie"), and elision in map-piecing is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with varied rhythm and vivid imagery ("zinc fragments clinked like tiny bells"); no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic decay with emotional treasure in a fresh, non-obvious way; specific details (calligrapher, postal fragments) and risk-taking in world-building heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
