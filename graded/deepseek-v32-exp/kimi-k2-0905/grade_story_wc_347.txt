<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict between duty and hatred embodied in micro-choices like cracking the nut and leaving handprints. Her endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing escape with visible cost. Emotions are concrete and character-particular, such as tasting iron and pine, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—travelers escape while Mara remains trapped, handprints fossilizing—under a causal lens that holds throughout. The nut's blueprint and time constraint shape tactics, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image of crystal fossils and Mara's return to duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the labyrinth and mechanical birds pressuring choices by limiting Mara's entry and demanding her indirect methods. Sensory details like frost-brittle grass and brass wings clicking are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image through fossilized handprints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under a causal lens, as the tightening timeframe and nut use force higher-stakes choices like crushing the kernel for a handprint. Cost is unmistakable in her isolation and the fossilized impressions, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty emerges through events and images, such as Mara's duty amid hatred, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fossilized handprints and her enduring prison, inviting reflection on sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in single POV, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "wings folding like prayers." Rhythmic control under pressure varies with urgency, and purposeful elision (e.g., the curse's origin) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "frost began to lace the grass blades like tiny white nooses" is coherent and advances momentum, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh elements—cursed orchard, mechanical birds, nut with blueprint—into an inevitable whole, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
