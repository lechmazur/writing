<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with her motivation; her internal conflict between suppression and empathy is embodied in key beats, such as swallowing her bottled emotions, and her final choice to reconstitute the sphere is earned with visible cost (lost reflection). The "courageous anomaly" trait shapes her actions throughout, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal lens with because/therefore linkages; closure lands decisively as Mara reconstitutes the sphere and thickens the border, with cost legible in her trapped reflection. Orientation is immediate, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lighthouse orchard and ice floes pressuring choices (e.g., dawn urgency) and the mirrors constraining tactics; the final image of the sphere hanging from the bough charges the closure with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Mara's agency, from sensing the thinning border to confronting the Keeper; cost is unmistakable in her emotional flood and reflection loss, forcing a trade-off between detachment and action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy vs. detachment emerges organically through images like bottled emotions and the reconstituted sphere; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the sphere's new purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in Mara's POV, with poetic diction ("shadow-laced peacekeeper") and rhythmic control; elision is taught early (e.g., mirror mechanics) and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language ("Images rushed together like colliding birds") enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements (memory, empathy) with fresh specificity (vintage store mirrors, bottled emotions); risk-taking in structure (memory-harbor transition) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
