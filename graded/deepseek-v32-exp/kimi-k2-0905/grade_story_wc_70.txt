<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder is concrete and intensifies under pressure, driving her ascent and climax lie. Her involuntary truthfulness constrains choices, and the final renunciation of routine is earned with visible cost. Interiority is embodied and character-particular, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Mara's lie reanimates the hive, reconfiguring her role and leaving the gate open. Causal lens holds tightly from blackout to ascent to lightning strike. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraint (truthfulness) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the tower forces forbidden ascent, and the dead hive charges the final image of reanimation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (ozone, ticking metal). Micro-setting (turnstile, matchbox) alters tactics and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving wonder to actively seeking spark, driven by Mara's agency in reading the riddle and ascending. Cost is legible in her lied truth and the open gate. Pressure tightens under causal lens through one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events: wonder versus routine, truth versus lie, with a resonant non-literal answer in the final image. No moralizing; subtext operates through riddle and irony. Ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature with poetic diction ("nectar dusk") and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable single, with no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of lightning collection and drone beehive failure, transformed through specific character and stakes. Emotional truth feels authentic, and risk-taking in climax heightens coherence. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
