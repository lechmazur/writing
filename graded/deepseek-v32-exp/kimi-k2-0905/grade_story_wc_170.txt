<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in backstory; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "her own pulse bucked"). Final choice to gift the heartbeat is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene during the weighing of choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible when she sets the heartbeat inside the frame, reweighting the premise. Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern buildup. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (heartbeat as bait) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, filtered through POV (e.g., "prism parapet," "cracked reflector"). Environment constrains choices and charges the final image where the terrace and mirrors are central to the climax. No generic placeholder issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (persuading mirrors) escalates through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the risk of losing the heartbeat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the third mirror demands surrender, forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility vs. reality emerges through events and images (e.g., mirrors showing futures), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of citizens receiving spectra, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent. Purposeful elision (coded lullabies) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats (e.g., "bell note carried pigment"). No clarity issues or artifactual deductions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mirage painting and borrowed heartbeats, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
