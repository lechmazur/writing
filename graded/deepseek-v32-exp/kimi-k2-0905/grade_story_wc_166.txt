<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysira's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in her choice of exile and desire to preserve memory. Her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "absence grew teeth," and her final act of becoming the forbidden memory is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, notably in her struggle between exile and return, compelling higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lysira becomes the forbidden memory, a conceptual repricing under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the nostalgia ban shapes tactics. The final image of her skin singing verses charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, such as moss and moonstone dust, filtered through Lysira's POV. The twilight garden and moonstone dust constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as micro-settings that alter tactics and deepen theme. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lysira's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes rising as she dances and inscribes verses. Cost is legible in the moonstone dust dimming and her sacrifice, foreclosing options and reweighting the dominant stake of memory preservation. One meaningful tightening occurs through her active choices, narrowing her path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and exile emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the verse lines. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Lysira becomes the memory, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through specific particulars, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lysira's poetic, rhythmically controlled voice. Elision is taught and paid off, such as in the gaps observation, without head-hopping. Syntax and diction reflect her state under pressure, enhancing emotional beats with clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "obsidian grace," advancing story without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closure image is sharp and undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes elective exile, tide dancing, and lunar verse in a fresh, non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates. The core concept integrates fully, committing to its implications with bold originality.</comment>
