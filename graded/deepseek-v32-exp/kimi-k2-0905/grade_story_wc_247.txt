<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The advisor's motivation is clear and rooted in his enigmatic nature, compelling his actions to translate silence into music. His quiet charisma is shown through embodied effects on others (e.g., stray dogs lowering heads), and his final offering of the camera demonstrates a micro-choice with cost. However, interior contradiction is minimal, leaning more on catalytic function than deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the town's changed relationship to silence carries conceptual cost ("people now paused mid-sentence"). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the advisor's actions building patternically to the final chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous harbor setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining the advisor's movement (e.g., climbing the cannery roof) and charging the final image of water as sheet music. Moonlight and salt trails integrate POV bias, though spatial choreography is slightly loose in the harbor's scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes in translating silence escalate through the advisor's agency under the accumulative lens, with each deletion of noise tightening the world's lightness. Cost is legible in moments like the boy smiling at his father's absent cough, though the escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as music emerges organically through images and actions, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the lingering note and townsfolk rehearsing signs, with subtext in "emptiness can be wound forward" deepening resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature filtering through the advisor's focus on silence and phosphor trails. Rhythm controls pressure peaks, such as the cadence shift at the chord's exhalation, and any elision (e.g., his lack of speech) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery (e.g., "water itself arranged into slow-moving sheet music"). Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats slightly risks coherence, but no loops or artifacts obscure closure; read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, mapping silence, and the camera is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific, risk-taking lyricism. Bold choices in accumulative design heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
