<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as the vine withers and pollen disperses, restoring memory under a causal lens.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the verdant arbor and dawn light filtering through, constraining Elara's choices through the vine's timed bloom.
