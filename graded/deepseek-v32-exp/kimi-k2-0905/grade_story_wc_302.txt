<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in her stolen voice, with embodied emotion shown through the sewn mouth and veil. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the watch to mark shelves, reveal character. The final choice to remove the thread and scream is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as her body dissolves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot coheres under a Hybrid drive lens, with causal time pressure and accumulative cipher patterns. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing as she becomes the library, with cost legible in her dissolution. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, supported by persistent constraints like the cyclically reversed doors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—glowing library, mist, phosphorescent tiles—and actively constrains choices through temporal phases and propagation delays. It charges the final image as shelves rearrange into her mouth, with sensory detail purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through her agency under the Hybrid lens, using the watch and cipher to navigate, with cost unmistakable in her transformation. The dominant stake of reclaiming her voice tightens meaningfully, though the escalation relies slightly on abstract concepts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and silence emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her becoming the library, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects her perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision like propagation delays is taught and pays off at closure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, even in peaks like the dissolution scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing unspoken words and temporal mechanics into a non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
