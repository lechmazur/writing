<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luma's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "feeling the tiles click like teeth") and micro-choices that reveal values. Her final choice to launch the rocket is earned by prior causality, and the cost of defying despair is felt in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with tight because/therefore linkages, from trade with Jax to rocket launch. Closure is a decisive change—sky cracking, starlight returning—with visible cost (people feeling weight loosen, hourglass floating). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details ("stone petals," "hissing rag knot") that constrain choices (spiral stair, battlement). The rag knot and fortress environment charge the final image, and details are filtered through Luma's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (defying hopelessness) escalate through Luma's agency under the causal lens, with key turns like the trade and confrontation narrowing options. Cost is legible on-page when the rocket punches through darkness, reweighting the dominant stake with felt impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (hope vs. despair, memory) emerges through particulars like the mosaic note and Luma's actions, without moralizing. The final image of "Remember" across the sky offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic voice ("chanting," "clinking like distant thunder") that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory filtering) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("corked darkness," "mosaic heart") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion. No register drift or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hope/despair theme through specific elements (fireworks designer, mosaic note) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
