<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of certainty for curiosity is earned with visible cost, and her methodically playful trait constrains actions throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing under the accumulative lens, as Liora becomes both question and answer with felt cost. The nickel's role as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices and charging the final image; the garden's folding and sound ribbons directly affect plot. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with basalt slabs and echoes woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, from refused song to nickel's barter and awakenings. Cost is legible in her trade-off, foreclosing certainty with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and action, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end via the guide's reply. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision is taught and paid off in the accumulative design, and dialogue is natural but minimal, advancing subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, though minor density in metaphors may slightly limit clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity anchors universals through unique elements like the sound wave garden.</comment>
