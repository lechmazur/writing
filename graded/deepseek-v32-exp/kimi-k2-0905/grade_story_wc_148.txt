<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like the lattice warming against his ribs. His final choice to step onto the staircase is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as Conceptual Repricing where the father's lies become a staircase of truth, cost legible in the "wolf made entirely of withheld truth." Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the lighthouse prison constraining choices like the hovering floor and rotating lens, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Cassian's agency, with cost unmistakable when the lattice casts a true beam and the hush becomes his heartbeat. Dominant stake tightens meaningfully, though pressure is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, as in the "wolf made entirely of withheld truth." Subtext operates through gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision, like the hovering floor, is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, as in "copperlight repose that forgave nothing but recorded everything." Closure is undimmed by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of the fable, with specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
