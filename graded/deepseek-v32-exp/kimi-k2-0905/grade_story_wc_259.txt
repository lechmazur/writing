<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion; final choice to carry memories gently is earned by prior causality and visible cost in anguished joy and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost (purification redefined as carrying memories); accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early, and constraint (pagoda/nostalgia atoms) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (archive, pagoda) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias; micro-setting (pagoda as locket) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in anguished joy and weight of memories; dominant stake (purification vs. identity) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer (purification as gentle carrying) that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled under pressure; elision (e.g., "avoiding patterns") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; minor figurative density in peak beats but no loops or muddle; rhythm varies naturally, advancing story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, archive, and post-apocalyptic elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
