<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The priest's motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions is clear and drives key choices, but interiority lacks deep emotional embodiment or contradictory impulses in scene, though his final sacrifice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (priest as anchor) and conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (silence, loops) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (sanctuary on a spatial fold) vividly constrains choices and charges the final image with sensory specificity; the palette and loop pedal recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by priest's agency in sculpting loops, leading to demon's hesitation with legible cost (his sacrifice); stakes tighten meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of faith through questioning emerges organically; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("faith is safest when it questions its own pulse") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic with rhythmic control; perceptual signature (e.g., "unraveled stillness") is consistent, and elision (e.g., silence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats (e.g., "a prism that split silence").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing loop pedals, rhetoric, and possession with risk-taking that heightens stakes; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
