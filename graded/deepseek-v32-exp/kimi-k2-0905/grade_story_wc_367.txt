<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation evolves credibly from routine duty to transformative agency; her embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as the cracked laugh and decision to steer, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice to laugh with shadowed elation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the lighthouse dissolves and Lirael becomes a reader, with cost legible in "the wick consume itself" and "dew that had never known ink." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of prophetic laughter pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse constrains choices and charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that shapes tactics; sensory details like "green fire crawling down the walls" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lirael's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Lirael's agency, from accidental prophecy to actively steering the lighthouse; cost is unmistakable in "each millimeter sacrificed translating shadow into newborn light," narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through shadows emerges organically from images and events, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "sowing accidental prophecies like seeds," avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "stars still lied," are consistent and purpose-driven, with any elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "a whale remembering harpoons" coheres in peak beats, and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the scene's urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in non-obvious synthesis of post-print decay and prophetic laughter; risks in structure and imagery heighten stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that maintain clarity.</comment>
