<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila's characterization is deeply integrated with her role as a noticer, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between fear and action drives the plot, and her final realization feels earned by prior causality. The trait "heuristically gentle" is shown through specific actions like wrapping the bread and planting with care, revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds strongly, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the sacred is revealed as continuous. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in Mila's tears and the city's renewal. The mosaic structure with shards (bakery, tea house, planting sites) is taught and coherent, supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "flour ghosts" and "tea-steam sighs" filtering through Mila's POV. The environment constrains choices, such as the guerrilla gardening sites altering tactics, and charges the final image of the palace stones uncloaking. Spatial choreography remains clear despite multiple locations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of memory loss vs. preservation escalate under the accumulative lens through Mila's agency in planting the bread, leading to a visible cost in the city's renewal. The dominant stake is signaled early, and the deepening reweights options with a felt price, though the escalation is more textural than causal, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of the sacred in the ordinary emerges organically through concrete actions like planting bread and the final image of "ordinary doorway possible altar." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Mila, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic yet grounded prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in the climax where "crumbs on her lips" convey realization. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present, supporting subtext and advancement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but occasional overwriting like "flour ghosts" may slightly blur clarity. Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates key beats. No major artifacts or loops, though minor figurative stacking in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "creeping normality noticer" is highly original and transformed through specific details like guerrilla gardening with bread. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
