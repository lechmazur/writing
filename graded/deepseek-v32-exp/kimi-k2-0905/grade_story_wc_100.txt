<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The undertaker's weary stubbornness is embodied through specific actions (trembling hands, salt on lips), and his final choice to become keeper is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tethered ankle, name in book). Interiority remains concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (undertaker's tethered tenure), under an accumulative/textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the library's need shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (drowned library, lens shard) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful (barnacled marble, phosphorescent scars). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment actively guiding the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from refusal to revitalization, with cost legible in burning paper boats and accepting tenure. Dominant stake (giving rest an address) tightens meaningfully through his actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of rest emerges through events and images (paper boats, lighthouse signals) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in implication, such as the lens projecting distress signals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision ("occupying impossible spaces") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistently biased to the undertaker's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and supports momentum (e.g., "books sighing shut"). Read-aloud rhythm is natural, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker and underwater library feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure and imagery that heightens stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific details (brass octopus catalog, paper boats), and the premise commits fully.</comment>
