<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cartographer's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood obsession; interiority is embodied (e.g., "dread pooled beneath them," "pulse hammered"); final choice to guide toward the crack is earned by prior causality with visible cost in "sunwashed dread" and "terrible chart."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost (city turns back, new chart); causal lens holds strong from altered note to watchers' response; orientation anchored early with city on turtles and rusted gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices (turtles' movement, Crack threat) and charges closure (watchers as oxidized metal); sensory details like "heat-shivered mirages" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tremor match prompts altered note, watchers stir, city changes course; cost legible in "sunwashed dread" and chart guiding toward risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and knowledge emerges through revelation about gate closure; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with poetic diction ("sunwashed dread"); perceptual signature consistent; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful and clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis (city on turtles, pattern languages); emotional truth in personal connection to lost expedition; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
