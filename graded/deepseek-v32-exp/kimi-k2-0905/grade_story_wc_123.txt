<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of integrity, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict between curiosity and caution is embodied in micro-choices, such as waiting for the pigeon and choosing lateral movement. The final decision to record truth is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitude and risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of unrecorded rain, reweighting truth's velocity with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident to resolution, with persistent constraints like the quarantine zone shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the message from future self integrates seamlessly without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the courtyard to the pneumatic shaft, constraining choices like lateral progression and charging the final image with phosphorescent lichen. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss. The environment actively pressures decisions and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrity vs. censorship escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the message to recording truth. Cost is legible in her decision to stay underground, foregoing safety. One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to send scrolls, narrowing options and deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and integrity emerges organically from events and images, such as the quarantine zone and the pigeon's scrolls, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the silvered rain, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Elara's professional bias in precise observations. Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful compression, like the description of the shaft, is taught and legible at closure.</comment>
