<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "bitter chill of betrayal") and micro-choices that reveal values. The final choice to deliver the flint is earned by prior causality, though some abstract moments slightly reduce impact. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and cost is visible in her metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Mara's metamorphosis and the city's transformation, a decisive change under an accumulative lens with conceptual cost (bitterness evaporating). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The arrowhead and confessions create coherent linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the underground garden constraining choices (e.g., vines for climbing) and the arrowhead charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, avoiding generic elements. Atmosphere supports theme cohesively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, from recording confessions to using the arrowhead, with cost legible in her metamorphosis. Dominant stake (internal conflict) tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are less pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in static and frost motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("harmony untamed is just another name for love") without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Mara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue (phone confessions) is natural and advances plot. Purposeful elision (e.g., static voices) is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle. Read-aloud test passes, and closure is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of cryptid research and cosmic humor, transformed through specific details (e.g., arrowhead, confessions). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth.</comment>
