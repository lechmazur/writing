<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mireya's empathetically decisive trait is consistently embodied through her actions and interiority, driving the plot with micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation roots in consistent traits, and the final choice to intersperse languages is earned with visible cost in her exhaustion. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in Mireya's exhaustion and the new equilibrium, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight: the broken weight necessitates repair, leading to the resonant reconfiguration. The persistent constraint of silence escalates to a bridge of resonance, with cost proof in "exhausted, apron glittering."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the astronomical clock tower and grain elevator constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and woven through action, such as the "copper artery" speaking tube. The environment pressures tactics and mirrors internal states, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering options and reweighting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring sound escalates through Mireya's agency under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening from broken weight to reconciled dialogue. Cost is unmistakable in the "silence ached" and her vigorous efforts, foreclosing isolation for shared custodianship. Protagonist's decisions narrow options and reweight stakes with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridges between human and mechanical emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the elevator's dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "a bridge is a song you can walk across," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic control and biased perception. Dialogue with the elevator is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure, with diction consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing story without muddle. Sentences propel momentum, and syntax supports emotional beats, as in "dew on wheat became prisms." Clarity and concision are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like choral librarian and talking elevator, transformed via specific world logic and character. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable. The concept integrates organically, resisting derivative templates.</comment>
