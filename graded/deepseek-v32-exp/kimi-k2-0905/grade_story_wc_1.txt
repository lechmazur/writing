<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with cost legible when she crushes the ledger and turns back.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she steps off the path, with cost visible in the crushed ledger and reclaimed beads. Orientation is clear early, and pattern-teaching pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as frost guiding her route and canyon narrowing shaping movement. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image with the beads igniting like sparks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening when she finds the campfire and understands the smugglers' fear. Cost is unmistakable in her decision to forego the pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ledger's pauses and frost patterns, offering a non-literal answer to purpose through her final image of hosting quiet hours. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature fitting the glass artist's perspective. POV is stable, and elision (e.g., ledger flaking) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "motivation felt like breath on cracked glass"). Minor density in metaphors, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry with a survival journey feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the ledger as braille. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
