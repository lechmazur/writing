<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey's boredom and immortal perspective are concretely embodied, with micro-choices like following the amulet hooking his "iron boredom." His final choice to step through the door is earned by centuries of seeking, though internal conflict is minimal but fitting for an immortal. The cost is felt in the transfer of the amulet's compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from storm to amulet to mutiny. Closure is a Decisive Change as Vey steps through the door, with cost legible in the darkness "peeling away time" and the mortals' rewritten future. Orientation is anchored early by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "shimmered like a bruise" and "solar ions braided through the lattice." The escondite constrains choices (e.g., corridors folding) and charges the final image of stabilized "new angles." POV filtering is consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Vey's quest for closure after goodbye, escalating through agency: amulet compulsion, mutiny confrontation, and deal-making. Cost is visible in the amulet transfer and Vey's departure, narrowing options under causal lens. Mortals' mutiny adds secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of immortality and goodbye emerges through images like the repeated "goodbye" and the door to darkness, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Vey chooses to "proceed" into silence, reweighting prior seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "walls that remembered every footstep." Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control in peaks like "centuries cracking like ice." No head-hopping; dialogue advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "Möbius sigh." No loops or scaffolds; clarity is maintained even in dense beats. Read-aloud test passes with smooth propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of immortal boredom, cursed amulet, and spatial mutiny feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
