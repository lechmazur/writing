<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the prism's warmth; final choice to become the prism is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the child's skeleton and her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of her as the new prism; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of light and sound building to resonance; orientation is clear early, and the missing shard constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selective, with the glass humming pavilion and desert environment constraining choices and charging the final image; the prism as micro-setting directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in tracking the shard, with cost unmistakable in the discovery of the child's skeleton; escalation is driven by choices under the accumulative lens, foreclosing options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the prism and star paths; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her becoming the prism, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with lyrical control, e.g., "a moan between mourning and morning"; perceptual signature is clear; elision is taught and paid off in closure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is cohesive and advances story, e.g., "thistle-blown hope" charges the climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis of retrocognition and post-collapse world; tropes are transformed through specific details like the shard of hush; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
