<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices, like feeding the manuscript strips into chemicals, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—dissolving words for transmission—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost: Mara's decision to transmit words upward reconfigures options, and the final image of the timer stopping charges the ending. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the storm and scars pattern paying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the observatory and storm constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the telescope tracking scars that mirror Mara's ribs, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the storm and her realization. The cost is legible when she rarefies her words, foreclosing the physical manuscript for ethereal transmission, and the final stance crystallization aligns with the storm's heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as scars and storms, with subtext in silence and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final stanza and the conceptual repricing of transmission, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision, like the pantomimed stanza, are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, such as "cartography of scars," and the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of censorship, poetry, and cosmic imagery, with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation of tropes through character and setting is organic.</comment>
