<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's motives are clear and rooted in her past as a councilor; her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hiding formula, using the bell) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling the cart's weight, and the final decision to triple runs is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The boy and Lita apply secondary pressure, but Mara's characterization remains dominant and flawlessly executed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost—the bell's silent ring reconfigures stakes, showing the network endures amid tightening sanctions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with details building to a resonant image. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks; the incomplete spiral and rationing threat make cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choices—the terra-cotta arbor as a meeting point and the bell as a micro-setting constrain tactics. Sensory details (e.g., terra-cotta flakes, wild sage) are selective and purposeful, filtering through Mara's POV. The environment charges the final image, with the arbor and ridge shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—Mara's decision to triple food runs responds to sanctions tightening, narrowing options with cost (rationing memories). Stakes are dominant early and deepen meaningfully, though the escalation is more intensification than reversal, fitting the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—silence as resistance and intergenerational support are woven through images like the silent bell and pebbles. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical rhythm and perceptual signature (e.g., "amplified quiet"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (boy's whisper). Elision is taught and paid off, such as the bell's significance, and no head-hopping occurs; prose modulates with pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peaks (e.g., "amplified quiet that traveled") doesn't harm clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in a fresh synthesis of resistance themes, with specific, irreplaceable elements like the bell as a map and pebble spiral. Risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
