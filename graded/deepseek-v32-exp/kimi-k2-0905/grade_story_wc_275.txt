<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her parents' legacies, with clear internal conflict and embodied emotions. Her micro-choices, like grafting the canvas, reveal a hierarchy of values and are earned by prior causality. The final choice to integrate violence into peace has visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens holds throughout, with closure in the resonant reconfiguration of Mira's garden as a living memorial.
