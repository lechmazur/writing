<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's characterization is deeply realized with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her composure cracking and picking up dough. Her motivation shifts credibly from passive observation to active participation, earned through prior causality. The final choice to shape "H" for home is a decisive change with visible cost, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Aurelia realizes culture must be shared, not preserved, with cost legible in the faded lens and dough shaping. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building patterns to the climax. Persistent constraints of displacement shape tactics, and the orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto city setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as melted ice bridges limiting access. It charges the final image of shared ovens and echoes, acting as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Aurelia's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aurelia's agency under the accumulative lens, shifting from cataloging to participating in arts. The cost is unmistakable in her changed actions and the shared purpose. The dominant stake of preserving dying arts tightens meaningfully through her realization and community response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the bread shaping and faded lens, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in dialogues like the grandmother's line about rescuing from forgetting. The ending reweights prior material with complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Aurelia's cultured observations. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as seen in Mei Chen's revelation about not waiting for flowers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "frozen waterfalls of memory," is consistent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and character without momentum loss, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of displacement, cultural preservation, and community action feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details, like bread shaping and opera glasses, transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
