<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in honoring her ancestor, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as decoding journals and confronting Voss. Her final choice to stay and catalog stanzas is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her enduring exile. Contradictory impulses (nervousness vs. confidence) act in scene, exemplified when her hands tremble from legacy's pull, not fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkage from Mara's exile to decoding and discovery, culminating in a decisive change where she reverses erasure and chooses to stay. Closure lands on-page with cost legible in her realization and the corroded helm-log, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The Reversible Exile Act constrains tactics throughout, shaping the final image of etched coordinates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "spongey plankwalk" and "mildew," pressuring choices through storms and restricted zones. The weather station functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics, such as using the holotable, and charges the final image with Mara etching coordinates on glass. Environmental details consistently mirror internal states, like the copper nail's patina matching the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Mara's agency, from decoding stanzas to launching the dirigible, with cost legible in her clenched nail imprint and reversed exile. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully when she confronts Voss, forcing a trade-off that narrows options. No coincidence resolves conflict; the wreck discovery is earned through mapped overlay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and bravery emerges through particulars like the copper nail and coded stanzas, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the question encoded in the jet stream, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through Mara's choice to stay, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's poetic observations and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Voss's admission about his brother, advancing plot with subtext. No head-hopping; elision in decoding is taught and paid off at closure, with consistent diction and psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "the sky’s spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies" doing multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, enhancing clarity. Read-aloud ear test passes with propulsion, and closure image remains sharp without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of reversible exile, map librarianship, and coded journals, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the copper nail's reprise. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, as seen in the jet stream encoding memory. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
