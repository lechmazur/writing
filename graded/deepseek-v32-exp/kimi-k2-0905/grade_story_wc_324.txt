<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal her persistent curiosity and protective drive. Her final choice to expose Hask is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his collapse and her discharged duty. Embodied emotions and contradictions, such as her illicit thrill balanced with duty, avoid stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from Lila's pulse to ledger discovery and confrontation. Closure is a decisive change—Hask's exposure and Lila's credit—landing with felt cost on-page in his collapse and the "reeling gratitude" of voices. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the hearing aid as persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (e.g., "mist-clad atrium," "vines mimicking heart valves") that pressures choices and charges the final image. The atrium and hearing aid function as micro-settings that constrain Mira's movements and amplify stakes. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the plot, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—escalates through Mira's agency under the causal lens, from investigating pulses to confronting Hask. Cost is legible in Hask's collapse and Mira's risk of exposure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she uploads the proof, foreclosing Hask's deception and altering the narrative outcome with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from events and images, such as the photograph and ledger reveal, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's reflection that heroism is "overheard, pursued, and assured." Subtext operates in gestures like Hask's trembling fingers and the coalescing mist shapes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, poetic diction filtered through Mira's professional bias. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "calm as fibrillation" during confrontation) without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Hask.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures that propel momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent (e.g., "dial fluttered like a trapped moth"), without loops or scaffold issues. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats, and the final image is charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes supernatural and bureaucratic elements with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the hearing aid and heart-trace program. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
