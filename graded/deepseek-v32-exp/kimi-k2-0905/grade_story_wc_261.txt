<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with specific sensory details (e.g., tasting iron and lilac). The protagonist's motivation to seek closure drives consistent micro-choices, and the final wound-reopening is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between remembering and forgetting the sister's laugh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing as the scar becomes a "period," cost legible in the blood offering. The accumulative textural lens holds throughout, with the hourglass and seed recharging the narrative. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the tower isolates, the coffee rings form a tunnel—and charges the final image with the seed on the windowsill. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias, such as the "meteor hush" absorbing machine beeps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conflict escalates through protagonist agency, from passive observation to active trade ("fresh loss"). Cost is unmistakable in bleeding and the resonant reconfiguration of the scar. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images like scars as "stories written sideways," offering a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in plant telepathy and the displaced miracle, with earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with rhythmic control and purposeful compression (e.g., "meteor hush"). POV is stable and idiom consistent, with no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, propelling the narrative to closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and no artifacts obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes grief, telepathy, and miracle in a fresh, inevitable way. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific details like the osage sapling.</comment>
