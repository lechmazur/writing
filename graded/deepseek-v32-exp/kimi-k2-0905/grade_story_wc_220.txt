<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scraps' motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied emotions like translating scent into syntax. Kite's drive to find her brother is straightforward but effective. The final choice to use the leaf with the cylinder is earned, though Kite's characterization lacks depth, slightly limiting the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the brother's rescue and Scraps' transformation, cost legible in the changed wind and Scraps' new role. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from the riddle to the journey. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like copper and iron smells, and the scrapyard constrains choices (e.g., digging in the wasteland). The leaf and phonograph recur to charge the final image, with the environment actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the brother escalates through the riddle decoding and journey, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is visible in the effort and Scraps' limping, with one meaningful tightening under the causal lens that narrows options to the coordinates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of distance, closeness, and preservation emerge through concrete images like the leaf and phonograph, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the wind smelling of orchard smoke, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited from Scraps, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., scent translation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peaks like "tinted revelations" doesn't obscure clarity. Sentence rhythm supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, bloodhound, and phonograph elements feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates, with the leaf and riddle transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
