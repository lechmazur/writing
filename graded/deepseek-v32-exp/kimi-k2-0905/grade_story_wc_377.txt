<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in her seasonal muteness, driving her actions with embodied emotion. Her micro-choices, like adjusting the sculpture, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—descending wordless after passing the wedge—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her silent endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the boy receiving the wedge, reconfiguring wonder's transmission. Cost is legible in the tuner's mute descent and the sculpture's lingering glow. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early with the bluff and stairs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bluff setting constrains choices by isolating the tuner and enabling the sculpture's calibration. Sensory details like "cold diamonds" and "high blue" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The kinetic sculpture functions as a micro-setting that directly shapes the climax with the comet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the comet's approach, forcing the tuner's final calibration under the Accumulative lens. Agency is evident in her adjustments, and cost is visible in the iceberg's shrinkage and her descent. The dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens through this deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as a frequency emerges through concrete images like the sculpture's light and the boy's after-image, without direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer with the wedge, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction like "shimmer of struck metal." Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., mute quarter) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "ribbons of unseen hues" serves the theme without muddle. Rhythm accelerates with the comet's approach, and closure is clear with "after-image still glistening."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bell tuning, kinetic sculpture, and cosmic event feels inevitable and fresh. Specific details like bronze wedges and glacier-forged steel anchor originality. Risk-taking in poetic language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures wonder memorably.</comment>
