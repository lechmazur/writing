<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's inquisitive nature is concretely embodied and drives micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing symbols and descending with a trowel. Her final decision to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her servant role with visible cost. The warmth against her cheeks and laughter show embodied emotion without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Lira shifts from ascending to expanding, rooted in joy. The causal lens holds tightly from goggles to diary to tree, with cost legible in her detachment from grief. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the map's revelation transforms options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire and hothouse constrain choices, such as the elevator's ascent forcing confined discovery and the tree's isolation requiring descent. Sensory details like "engine-oil and bergamot" are selective and POV-filtered. The goggles as a micro-setting charge the final image by translating light into joy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from decoding symbols to planting the seed, with cost visible in her renunciation of duty. The dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—tightens through each beat, such as trading the thimble for coal ash, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the apricot tree defying winter, offering a non-literal answer to sorrow's fortress. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the duke's son playing a major chord, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext, as in the stoker trade. Elision is taught and paid off, such as the goggles' amber tint deepening discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "joy disguised as ornament," is consistent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and character, with clear propulsion in peaks like the diary's unlock.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of icebound spire, encrypted diary, and hothouse tree, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
