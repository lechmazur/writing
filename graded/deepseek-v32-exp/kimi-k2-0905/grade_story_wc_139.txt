<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassidy's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict shown through embodied emotion (e.g., stomach lurch, rehearsing the equation). Her final choice to trade the memory is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the loss of the lullaby, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: Cassidy gains the asylum grant but loses a memory, and Rurik is left with useless ink. The causal lens holds throughout, with cost legible in the vanished tune and Rurik's retching, and the ink's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral home setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like formaldehyde and lilacs. The ink pot as a micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, influencing the climax and meeting the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (mother's asylum), and escalation is driven by Cassidy's agency in using the ink under the causal lens. The cost is unmistakable in the memory loss, and the trade-off reweights options, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trade and redemption emerges from events without direct statement, via the ink's cost and the equation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the balanced equation, avoiding moralizing and meeting the quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Cassidy's voice (e.g., "the ink rose in a slow coil"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping, and prose reflects her state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful ("dawn was a bruise"), and rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical ink, political asylum, and memory trade feels inevitable. Risk-taking with magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details (e.g., ink residue quivering) anchor the concept.</comment>
