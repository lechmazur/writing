<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in loss, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation as the offering is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her unraveling. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where she becomes the geography, with cost legible in her transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of calls and actions coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects like the censer foot and signal station constrain choices and charge the closure image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with moon phases and environment actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of reversing loss escalate through protagonist agency under accumulative lens, driven by phone calls and actions. Cost is unmistakable in her becoming the offering, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss and return emerges through particulars like the censer foot and reversed migration, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., cryptic calls) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks, but clarity remains at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of patchwork identity and reverse migration feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes. Specific details and transformation of tropes avoid derivative premises.</comment>
