<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The statue's interiority is concrete and embodied, with thought blooming "like warm ink" and micro-choices under pressure, such as the decision to crack the ampoule, earned through prior awakening. Contradictory impulses act in scene, balancing stasis and change, with the final renunciation of certainty foreclosing a path at visible cost. Motivation to "welcome nuance" is clear and intensifies, driving higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: "Certainties dissolved into questions" and "stone skin soften, not to flesh but to possibility." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory revelations to a final image that reweights meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the keystone arch's structural weakness pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choice and charges the final image, with the keystone arch shaping the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, such as "bruised glow" moonlight and "sea-grass that bowed like courtiers," filtered through the statue's POV. Setting subtly guides action and mirrors internal states, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, from awakening to the deliberate cracking of the ampoule, narrowing options from certainty to nuance. Cost is legible on-page: "statues turned their heads, not in judgment but in recognition" and "stone skin soften." Stakes between stasis and change are signaled early and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the ampoule's release leading to "cascading revelations," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth and memory. Subtext operates in implication, like "poison and remedy share roots," without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with "statues arguing gently over what truth might become tomorrow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature: "telepathy spilled through every crack" and "shy, electric" thoughts. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining consistency under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, as in the gardener's backstory braided into the present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "Revelation is not a hammer; it is a dialogue spoken in fractures" doing multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The premise of a telepathic statue in a drowned garden is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the "foxglove-stained glass ampoule" are indispensable. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
