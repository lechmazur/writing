<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia and motivation to remember create consistent micro-choices under pressure, such as crawling through the "throat of stone" despite fear. Her internal conflict between terror and duty is embodied, and the final renunciation of fear for obligation is earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara accepts the "obligation of remembering," with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and phase transitions are taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, like the corridor narrowing to "living basalt," and the gold fleck charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's urgency. The environment evolves causally with phase shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as speaking names thins the gold fleck and reverses the phase transition. Cost is unmistakable in her scraped knees and emotional shift. Dominant stake of remembrance tightens through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory emerges through particulars like the gold fleck and spoken names, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to stand by the unremembered is not to anchor them in sorrow but to return them... to the breathing world."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "the corridor narrowed, concrete giving way to living basalt." Lyrical prose modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., phase mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "fractal burns across reality" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with Mara's descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undersea horror and memory themes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in phase-shift logic that heightens stakes. The gold fleck and cable concept are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
