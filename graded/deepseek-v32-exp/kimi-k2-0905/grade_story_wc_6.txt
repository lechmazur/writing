<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply layered with contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as flinching at the gull's cry while keeping hands steady, embodying her struggle between anger and compassion. Her final choice to bring saplings is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her enduring commitment. Micro-choices under pressure, like tapping her scar, reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's promise to bring saplings reconfigures her mission, with felt cost in the ongoing reconciliation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, weaving memories and symbols into a coherent pattern. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lagoon's role charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and micro-settings like the black sand and coin constrain choices and charge the closure, with sensory details (salt wind, damp earth) filtered through Mara's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as using lagoon water to seal the graft, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, as memories and symbols deepen the stake in transforming scars, with cost legible in her whispered promise and the hiss of memory. The dominant internal conflict tightens through a meaningful cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the graft and coin, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing scars without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (e.g., the coin as a "listening heart"), and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in Mara's firefighter perspective (e.g., counting stars like "sprinkler heads"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision of memories interleaves with present micro-choices without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "scars could sing," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, as Mara's role transforms the arsonist narrative through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, supported by unique elements like the drachma coin.</comment>
