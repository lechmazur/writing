<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her blindness and skill are embodied through specific actions like reading light refraction. The final choice to teach the drone balance is earned by her past trauma and present ingenuity, with visible cost in the time constraint. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrases.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the drone launches successfully, under a causal lens reinforced by time pressure. The cost is legible in the village's wait for antidotes, and the persistent constraint of the ship's departure shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, with no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rail depot's mist and steam creating atmosphere; the water barrel and light refraction constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Lira's blindness, enhancing urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the live clock and the drone's feedback loop, driven by Lira's agency in using water to calm it. The cost is unmistakable in the medical seeds' delay, and one meaningful tightening occurs when the jitter requires a innovative solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of decoding feedback into direction emerges through events and images, such as the drone learning balance from chaos, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the drone's graceful flight, reweighting prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Lira's perceptual signature shaped by blindness; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., light refraction mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "magnetic calm" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene urgency, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of blindness, light refraction, and drone repair, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the unique method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
