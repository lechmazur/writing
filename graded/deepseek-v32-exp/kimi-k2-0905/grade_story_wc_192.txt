<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses shown in her practice of suffocation and admission of her own suffering. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling the ritual choice. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared scars and the boy's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the boy's gift of breath and the keeper's realization. The Accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the fading threshold concept persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary constrains choice through the scorched circle and starlight, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the keeper's POV. The setting pressures the ritual and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the ritual of linking scars. The cost is legible in her shared suffocation and the boy's transformation. The dominant stake of release tightens meaningfully, foreclosing the option of stagnation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as suffocating to breathe, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the boy's first breath in death. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, enriching the central question of death and rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to the keeper's perspective, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the boy's backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the lyrical, contemplative approach. The core concept of fading threshold transforms familiar tropes through specific character choices. Bold choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
