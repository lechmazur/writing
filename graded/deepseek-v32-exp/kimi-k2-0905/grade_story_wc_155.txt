<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luma's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to display the memory costs "a sigh of present sorrow," earning the renunciation through prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as joy rediscovered but not yet reclaimed, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mural glows as a "private dawn." Cost is legible in "pocket empty yet heart over-exposed," and orientation is clear early. The fresco fragment and fog persist as constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "plaster still smelled faintly of fermented stars" filtering through Luma's POV. The ruined orchard and cider house constrain choices and charge the final image, where the wall "projects its secret reel," integrating environment into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy escalates through Luma's agency under the Accumulative lens, from finding the fragment to projecting the memory. Cost is unmistakable in each brushstroke costing "a sigh of present sorrow," and the tightening forecloses options by binding the fragment to the wall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the fresco fragment dissolving to heal "broken branches," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, like "joy had never been lost," earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "the fog knitted itself into a dome." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., daydream folding time) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "coaxing sunbeams out of the fog," and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes painting with light, memory projection, and spectral networks into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates, as in the "vermillion cheek smiling from the mist."</comment>
