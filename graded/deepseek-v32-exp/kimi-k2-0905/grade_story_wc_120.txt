<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's chronological homesickness and desire to conduct unheard symphonies are deeply embodied; internal contradictions act in scene, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as mapped memories become home, with cost legible in the protagonist's exhaustion and the crumbled shell; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (glass spire limits time, lake reflects scores) and charges the final image; sensory details (frost feathers, dawnlight) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under textural lens through memory mapping and time pressure; protagonist agency drives deepening, with cost visible in buckling knees and dissolved ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of home emerges through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the folded horizon, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; perceptual signature biases observation; rhythmic control under pressure supports accumulative pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "clef that looked like a breaking wave") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, music, and home feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure recharges particulars.</comment>
