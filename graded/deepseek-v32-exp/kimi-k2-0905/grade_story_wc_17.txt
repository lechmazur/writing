<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies through personal discovery; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "felt the name rise in her throat like a stone"). Micro-choices under pressure, like following the passage deeper, reveal values, and the final transformation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor passivity in climax is offset by accumulative lens fit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost: Mira becomes part of the building's dream, her heartbeat the echo, reweighting legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds tightly, with linkages through discoveries (diaries, negatives) leading to realization. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., ivy-veiled passage as shutter) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perception. The environment functions as a micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes deepening through discoveries. Cost is legible in her transformation, foreclosing her identity. Pressure coheres through density increase, though one minor tightening point exists; overall, agency and cost are clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy emerges through events and images (e.g., inverted frames, film negatives) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mira's absorption, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "listening to the stone remember"). Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., patterned repetition) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "silver flaking like old paint") causes a hairline slip. Clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is innovative (building as camera, legacy as archive), synthesized with specificity through character and stakes. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking, and the transformation feels inevitable. Fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
