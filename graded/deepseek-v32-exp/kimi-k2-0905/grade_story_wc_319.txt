<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is clear and rooted in dimensional homesickness, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like frost-collecting fur. Micro-choices under pressure, such as offering the pendant and refusing to cross, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of crossing is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in her decision not to cross, accepting uncertainty. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern taught early and coherence through the ritual. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the boundary pulse reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the frozen garden and mist constraining choices (e.g., hedge labyrinths shaping movement) and charging the final image of the un-frozen garden. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, such as rosemary brittle as parchment, integrating action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the ritual with the pendant, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge and options. Protagonist agency in waiting drives the stakes, with cost visible in her acceptance and the expanded boundary of light. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the pendant's Morse message and the final threshold, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to uncertainty. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "seeing is also a kind of leaving"), avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythmic control (e.g., "frost upon frost"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks, but no loops or artifacts harm closure. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing library guardian, frozen garden, and light boundaries into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., waiting as method), with risk-taking in structure and theme that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
