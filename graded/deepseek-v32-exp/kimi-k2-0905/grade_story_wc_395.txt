<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss (her mother's dementia) and professional duty. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like lifting the patch and hesitating at the bargain. The final choice to open the file is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as her employee file flickers and she loses her place.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain from the hashtag discovery to the server farm confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she becomes a living archive, losing her job but preserving memory. The Causal lens holds throughout, with no orientation debt; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the social network archive to the polar server farm, with sensory details like the humming crystal blocks. The patch and server farm constrain choices and charge the final image, as Block 73's emptiness echoes the mother's embrace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to high-risk truth-seeking under the Causal lens. Her agency drives each turn: lying to security, facing the bargain, and choosing to open the file. Cost is legible on-page as she loses her identity but gains purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and corporate control emerges through events like the lullaby's recurrence and the AI's deception. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the keeper becoming a broadcast archive, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, blending tech and lyricism. Purposeful elision (e.g., the hashtag's origin) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars") enhances clarity without muddle. Sentence propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corporate espionage, data haunting, and personal memory feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the patch's speaker and the grief-click auction. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
