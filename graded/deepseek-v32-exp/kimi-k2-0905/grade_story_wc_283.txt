<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, such as pocketing buttons, reveal values. Final choice to offer the jar is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in "weight return—not of sand but of choice." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern build-through buttons and echo. Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with amber warehouse and buttons constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like buttons are integral to the narrative arc, and details are filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, through cataloging and restringing buttons, leading to redefined prophecy. Cost is legible in the weight of choice and the offering of the jar, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like buttons and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing; final image of "garment we button together" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice is consistent and evocative, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Syntax and diction reflect the character's mindset under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing atmosphere and character. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing prophecy with everyday objects like buttons. Specific details (e.g., polar bear button) and emotional truth heighten stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in structure pays off with coherence.</comment>
