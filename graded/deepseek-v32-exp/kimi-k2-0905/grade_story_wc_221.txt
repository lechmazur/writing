<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as crawling into the crawlspace. Interiority is concrete, though minor abstractions in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Kael joining his mother in a timeless space, redefining "true north" with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observation deck and temporal stretching constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "frost-rimmed window" and "crawlspace no larger than a coffin" woven purposefully into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, from the compass twitching to crawling in, narrowing options with cost legible in his transformation. Dominant stake of internal grief tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "true north" as emotional connection emerges through images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure without moralizing. Subtext in the compass and maps deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose like "photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late." No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, though minor figurative density in high-pressure beats prevents a higher score. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and grief feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes. The time-dilated space for grief transforms familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
