<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., switching to glacier recording) revealing competence and humility. Interiority is concrete, such as feeling the fracture as a "subsonic tremor," but lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the temporary peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with coherent cause-effect linkages; orientation is anchored early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tricksters' carrier folds, leaving civility "waiting for its next sentence," with cost felt in the paused power plays. The lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints (e.g., astronomical charts) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory ("sodium lights... dried blood," "burnt solder"), with the radio station and tools constraining choices (e.g., tower and generator). The environment charges the final image through "ethereal grit," and recurring objects (astronomical charts) evolve in use. Sensory selection reflects Lyra's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing violence) escalates under the hybrid lens via Lyra's agency: tricksters test, she counters, they adapt, she shifts tactics. Cost is legible in the temporary calm and her effort, with one meaningful tightening (feedback howl collapse) that narrows options. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as interference as "another word for love," without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like "felt... tremor of returning civility," and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to combating manipulation. Complexity avoids tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("ethereal grit," "velvet migraine"). Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction remains within Lyra's lexicon, and rhythmic variation supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "moon—now a chipped silver coin"), and momentum is maintained through concrete action. Read-aloud rhythm is natural, and peak beats are clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic tricksters and subsonic interference with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth anchors the premise, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded details like the radio station setup.</comment>
