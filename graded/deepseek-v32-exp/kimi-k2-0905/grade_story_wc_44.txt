<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in scholarly curiosity, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; her final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost when she trades her wandering silhouette.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost under a hybrid accumulative lens; the loop-closing method shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choices through the orrery and automaton, charging the final image with the sundial and shadow reattachment; sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and Lyra's agency drives escalation under the accumulative lens, leading to a cost-legible sacrifice that narrows options and reweights the world state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of shadows, culminating in a non-literal resolution that reweights absence as love bent by light, without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctly lyrical, with a perceptual signature reflecting Lyra's scholarly mindset; controlled rhythm and elision pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
