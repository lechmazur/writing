<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hoshiko's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a dye master, with embodied interiority (e.g., feeling the donor heart beat faster) and an earned change realized through her engagement with the wing. Her final purpose shift is credible and costs the dissolution of the wing, though contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final image of folding the painting legibly costs her previous identity, and the donor heart's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the floating tea house and wing constraining choice (e.g., drifting higher affects atmosphere) and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Hoshiko's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding story magnetism) escalates through Hoshiko's agency with the wing, leading to a cost-legible renunciation (wing dissolves, she embraces teaching). Under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (e.g., wing dissolution, painting) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material through Hoshiko's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Hoshiko's dye master perspective. Poetic, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "valley-mist wonder") enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "quietly explosive sparks"), and closure clarity is untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of donor heart memories and story magnetism feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., dye master wisdom) avoid template plots, and transformation is grounded in character.</comment>
