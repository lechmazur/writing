<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in past failure (scar), with embodied emotion in actions like mask removal. Interiority is concrete through sensory perception, but lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene. Final consecration is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the stabilized echo and scar; Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly. Orientation is clear early, and peripheral awareness shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choice, with the kinetic parapet and pavilion architecture constraining actions and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom) escalates through accumulative density and protagonist agency in consecration, with cost felt in the scar and effort. One meaningful tightening forecloses options under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like conjured clearings and peripheral awareness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature biased toward sound and movement; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (peripheral awareness) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like consecration. Propulsion advances story seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar concepts (wisdom preservation) through specific, non-obvious choices like peripheral awareness and kinetic structures, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
