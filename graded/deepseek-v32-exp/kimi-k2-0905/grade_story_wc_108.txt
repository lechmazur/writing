<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's phobia and stunt double identity create compelling internal conflict; his micro-choices under pressure, like deciphering the cast, reveal embodied emotion and consistent motivation. The final stance—embracing vulnerability—is earned through prior causality with visible cost when he projects the raw footage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from DNA test to library quest, with clear orientation early. Closure is a decisive change: leaking the uncut reel reconfigures his identity with felt cost as security confronts him, and the shell's whisper loops to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—shelves list, drainage alcove hides the shell—and charges the finale when stars spill through the roof. Sensory details (metallic creaks, starlight) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—escalates under causal lens via agency: deciphering the cast message narrows options to the alcove, and facing security forces a costly choice. The cost is legible when guards hesitate, allowing his escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell's message and Leo's actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of "lights that would never again drown the shake" reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—industry jargon ("betray the frame") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with the girl carries subtext and advances plot, and elision (e.g., shell's whisper) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("rusted library groaned like an old prop ship") is consistent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes stunt double phobia and identity betrayal with non-obvious ingenuity; specific details (neon signatures on cast) and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
