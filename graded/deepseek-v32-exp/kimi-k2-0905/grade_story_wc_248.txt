<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember's motivation is clear and intensifies, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing walls and decoding art. Her transformation from destructive to preserving force is earned through causal links to her grandmother's promise and the artistic trail. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her pyromania understanding destruction's dual nature, and the final choice is motivated with visible cost in the archive's collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Ember realizes her arson was for revelation, not destruction, and the archive collapses, fulfilling its purpose. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from her artistic trail to the tapestry's revelation. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in her transformed identity and the physical collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like soot-stained walls and lavender-sulfur perfume that reflect Ember's POV. The archive constrains choices by guiding her descent, and the tapestry fragment charges the final image by reweaving into her grandmother's portrait. Micro-setting elements like the false wall and niche integrate seamlessly into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing the forgotten promise escalates under the causal lens through Ember's agency, as she decodes the artistic trail and overlays patterns in her mind. Cost is felt in the archive's collapse and her personal transformation, narrowing options from destruction to preservation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tapestry glows and reweaves, forcing a trade-off between false and true history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of destruction as necessary for preservation emerges organically from events like the burning of libraries and the tapestry's revelation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of Ember as keeper of truth, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the scratched-out self-portrait shifting meaning, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a poetic, analytical texture reflected in phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and selective perception biased by Ember's mindset. POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression in backstory that anchors in present cues. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the descent sequence, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor figurative repetition like "volcanic tenderness" is pattern-taught and purposeful, not muddying peak beats. No loops or scaffold obscure causality; propulsion remains clear through the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes arsonist-as-preserver with artistic decoding in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as seen in the tapestry's transformation. Specific details like charcoal sketches and chemical compounds anchor originality in character-driven choices.</comment>
