Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his struggle against the prophecy, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the summoner's swallowing of the sphere reweights silence with cost. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The final image of the sphere rotating inside him charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the prophecy fighting back and the summoner's mapping of silence tightening options.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the cranes and silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about mastering inner fire.
