<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that earn the final act of swallowing the page. The cost is felt in her surrender to the vortex and the lab's destruction, though contradictory impulses are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara surfaces and affects the child, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible when she triggers the buoy and the lab surrenders air, with the dice and web as persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains choices through water pressure and silt, charging the final image with the spider's web and dice. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, with stakes tightening via the web's timeframe and dice rolls. Cost is visible in the lab's destruction and her internalization of the seed, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as strength emerges through dance and encryption, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the child's movement. Subtext operates in imagery and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's observations. Voice control under pressure is excellent, and any elision (e.g., dance steps) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the vortex waltz, enhancing propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking through dance in a sunken lab feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes (e.g., dice as compass) is specific and coherent.</comment>
