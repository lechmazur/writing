<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of boundaries is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lake's transformation. However, some emotional states are abstractly rendered, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (ice becoming mist, boundaries dissolving), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the poet's agency drives the structure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory detail integrated into action. The quartz colonnade and ice evolve causally, shaping the poet's tactics and the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through her paraphrasing actions. Cost is legible in the ice fissures and lake's transformation, though the middle beat lacks a sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and events, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to boundaries without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the quartz harmonizing, and the final couplet reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, controlled rhythmic prose, and purposeful elision. The perceptual signature is consistent, and diction remains within the poet's lexicon, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, though minor overwriting in peak beats slightly reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of poetic magic and boundary dissolution, with risk-taking in lyric structure that heightens stakes. The transformation feels inevitable, and specifics like the quartz colonnade are irreplaceable.</comment>
