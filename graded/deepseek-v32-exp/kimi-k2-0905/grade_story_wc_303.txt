<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion like "mulberry ache" and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to play the violin is earned by prior causality, including the coffee stain vision and cereus whispers, with visible cost in the cracked dome and rewritten destinies. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies compellingly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Lira plays the violin, propagating winter and cracking the empire's foundations, reflected in her tired eyes. Causal lens holds tightly from research to action, with orientation anchored early. The moon's slippage creates persistent time pressure, shaping tactics and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the closure: the observatory's velvet dome cracks under the violin's notes, and the cereus's roots anchor Lira's decision. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "crushed lilac and old starlight," filtered through Lira's POV to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from reading the coffee stain to playing the violin, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. Cost is unmistakable: harvests fail, the throne is lost, and frost propagates, with the final image legibly showing the empire's foundations cracked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like perforated destiny and propagation, with subtext in images and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's actions and the faded coffee stain, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with purposeful compression in peaks like "bow trembling like a question mark." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "violin’s hollow body was a lung full of ancestral cold," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable: ice violin, plant telepathy, and coffee divination intertwine organically. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific choices. The core premise commits fully, with freshness in the non-obvious moral calculus and closure.</comment>
