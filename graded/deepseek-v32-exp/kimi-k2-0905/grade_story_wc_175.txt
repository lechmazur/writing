<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to build the memorial; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., crying at the end). Her final renunciation—letting the memorial go—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and the empty pocket. However, minor passivity in peak beats slightly limits agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the memorial lifts, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost; Accumulative lens holds strong through pattern buildup. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens is consistent, with the transient roots shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (e.g., "bowl of emerald ferns suspended in sky"), constraining choices through transient roots and charging the closure. The grotto's ephemerality pressures Elara's actions, integrating seamlessly with theme and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring overlooked histories) escalate under Accumulative lens via butterfly arrivals and memorial construction; Elara's agency in weaving the wing drives deepening, with cost legible in her emotional release. However, escalation is subtle, relying on texture over dramatic turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transience and memory emerges organically through images and actions (e.g., the wire cathedral lifting); subtext in the butterfly's reflection of stories offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the moth wing's origin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "interrupted cadence" mirroring rhythm). No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the grotto's dissolution) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied syntax and no significant loops or scaffolds; figurative language coheres (e.g., "wire cathedral wrapped in wings"). Minor overwriting in descriptive passages doesn't harm clarity or closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transience and memory through specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with freshness in the butterfly's role and the memorial's weightlessness.</comment>
