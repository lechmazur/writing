<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a curator of forgotten things, intensifying to compel higher-stakes choices like using the borescope and choosing to witness rather than open the box. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "felt the tale settle like dust between her ribs," and her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the community's transformation. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she shifts from investigation to passive listening, revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the community's offerings and Mira's internal shift, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mailbox mystery builds through purposeful accumulation, with no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of listening shapes tactics and the final image, making the closure indispensable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "courtyard glowed rose-gold" and "mosaics cool underfoot" filtered through Mira's POV. The mailbox and locket function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and deepening theme. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving listening heals) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency: gathering rumors, using the borescope, hearing the pulse, and culminating in community silence. Cost is unmistakable on the page in the transformed courtyard and offerings, foreclosing other paths with visible trade-offs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira decides not to open the box, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the mailbox's pulse and the final offerings, without direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of listening as healing, reweighting prior material with undeniable cost. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure, e.g., "the calm of a sandstorm that has spent itself." Purposeful elision (e.g., the mailbox's mystery) is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in community interactions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "Night swallowed the tiles, and Mira stayed..." Read-aloud ear test passes with purposeful syntax and clarity. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of healing via listening, transformed tropes, and specific details like the locket and courtyard. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and authenticity avoid derivative premises.</comment>
