<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like overriding instinct to flee. Her final choice to use the vial is earned by prior causality, sacrificing her last anchor to home with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change: Mira's signal is amplified and rescue arrives, with cost legible in the loss of the vial. The causal drive lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of time running out shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cracked lapis tiles" and "coral-grown organ" filtering through Mira's POV. The temple and organ constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics and outcome. Specificity is selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival escalates under the causal lens through Mira's agency, notably her decision to use the vial, which narrows options and carries cost. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, with the timeframe and temple's resistance forcing higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the vial representing ephemeral hope, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the temple's transformation, reweighting prior material with complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature like "gathered hush" and rhythm that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, such as the vial's early introduction leading to climax. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "lilac drop hovered like a violet star," enhancing clarity. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of underwater survival and sensory magic, with tropes transformed by specific details like the scent-to-frequency conversion.
