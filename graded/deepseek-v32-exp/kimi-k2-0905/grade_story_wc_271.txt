<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority using somatic markers. The final choice to live "damaged yet upright" is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in tears and resolve. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. optimism) act in scene, and the renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the protagonist commits to living like the trees, with cost legible in tears and the somatic map. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the constraint of grief shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the arboretum and cliff constraining choices (e.g., roots gripping stone) and charging the final image. Sensory details (salt, eucalyptus) are filtered through POV and mirror internal states. The dragon's-blood pine directly shapes the closure by sealing Nadia's image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between grief and optimism) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (freezing moments, releasing photograph). Cost is unmistakable in tears and the resolve to continue. One meaningful tightening occurs when the photograph is carried away, forcing a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events (e.g., "pearl of stillness," trees outlasting), without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "covenant" to live like trees, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like transferring laughter to the tree.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., mapping plant names to hollow places). Prose has rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., drone strike backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Figurative language (e.g., "drone as a distant heron") serves closure without obscuring causality. Propulsion accelerates with the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, somatic markers, and arboretum setting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., dragon's-blood pine resin) avoid template plots, transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
