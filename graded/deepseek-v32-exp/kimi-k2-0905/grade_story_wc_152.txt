<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like synchronizing heartbeat to silence. The trait of disguising wisdom as foolishness drives key choices, and her final revelation is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strongly, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change—the coup is averted—and cost is legible when the lieutenant lowers his pistol, reconfiguring the night without gunfire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the cobalt observatory and eternal candle constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the autumn wind and stained-glass panes are woven into action, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around the republic's survival escalate through the embroiderer's agency, culminating in the map revelation that narrows options. Cost is visible in the trembled pistol and changed conspirators, under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with her new chart, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual bias. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision like "echoed silence" is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and no artifacts. Figurative language like "silent galaxies" enhances momentum without muddle, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized, transforming the embroiderer trope through specific detail and risk-taking in structure. The hidden map and reversal feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
