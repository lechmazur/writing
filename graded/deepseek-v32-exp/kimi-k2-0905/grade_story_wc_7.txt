<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tasting the glass. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as planting the seed and pruning, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance in planning the next seed is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the rebellion's spread. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Conceptual Repricing: the Ministry's disarming and seed distribution reweights the premise with undeniable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with causality intact from planting to transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image charges prior material. No outline-like sequencing or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Marisol's POV. Specificity like "rusted ribs" and "cracked panes" is purposeful, and the environment evolves causally. Micro-setting elements like the soil and vines alter tactics and support the theme. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marisol's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, from planting the seed to its growth affecting the city. The dominant stake of gentle rebellion tightens through a meaningful deepening, with cost legible in the Ministry's response and seed spread. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as pruning symbolizing renewal, without direct statement. The final image of seeds spreading offers a resonant, non-literal answer to rebellion and memory. Subtext operates in gestures like Marisol's laugh, and complexity avoids tidy morals. No sermonizing or abstract philosophizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in Marisol's noticing, like "tasting the memory of every gardener." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful compression serves the closure. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats; lines like "vines rising fast as clock hands" are clear and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation. Minor overwriting is balanced by clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements like memory-tasting and synaptic plasticity into a fresh, non-obvious angle on rebellion. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric mode heightening stakes. Specific details anchor universals, and no derivative templates or echoes are present. Transformation test passed.</comment>
