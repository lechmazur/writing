<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alya's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a curious engineer; her micro-choices under pressure, like using the sextant shard and rerouting glycol, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., her laugh "like a valve clearing its throat," avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to return with interns is earned by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with felt cost in her stoic smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of "brass and glycol on her tongue" and the terminal's reclaimed wonder. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from sextant alignment to glycol redirection. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and persistent constraints like frozen valves shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, e.g., the "cathedral of dry pumps" forces improvisation. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, like "raffle tickets that looked like failed star charts." The sextant shard as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under causal lens is driven by Alya's agency, from tracing the sextant to rerouting glycol, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is visible in the "improvised welds" and the spinning coin "longer than physics politely allows." Dominant stake (hope through equations) tightens meaningfully with each beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope through redirection emerges from particulars like the sextant's reprise and the equation "Hope = (Redirected Flow × Residual Heat) / Time³," offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in images like the "maze of intentions" redefined as a test, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic, technical voice reflective of Alya's engineer mindset. Perceptual signature is consistent, e.g., noting "rust had landscaped every surface into Martian vermillion." Purposeful compression, like "a mechanical rhyme across centuries," is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, e.g., "raffle tickets into spirals, each ticket a zero-mass comet," is coherent and enhances clarity. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of civil engineering, spaceport decay, and carnival ghosts, transformed through specific choices like the sextant's role. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in prose heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
