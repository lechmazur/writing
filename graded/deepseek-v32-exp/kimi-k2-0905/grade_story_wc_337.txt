<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure; his internal conflict and micro-choices, like feeling the fracture lines as his own, reveal embodied emotion. The final realization—that broken things let light through—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the accumulated silence lifting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the masks singing and silence lifting. The drive lens holds throughout, and orientation is anchored early in the prism sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and net function as micro-settings that constrain choices, such as the net's knots requiring unraveling. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with spectral light and pooled silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency in unraveling knots, releasing stories that deepen the stake of freeing spirits. Cost is unmistakable in the rising tide of silence and its eventual lift, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as broken masks as maps, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the spirit's touch feeling like wind.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that remains controlled under pressure. Elision, like the timeframe stretching, is taught and pays off in the closure's charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "silence pooled like rising tide," is coherent and propels momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mask restoration and spirit voices with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
