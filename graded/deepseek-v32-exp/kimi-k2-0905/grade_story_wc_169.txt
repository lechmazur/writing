<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as a logical dreamer is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like pricking her finger and speaking the equation under pressure. Interior contradiction between logic and hope is shown in scene, and the final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the serene upheaval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the serene upheaval and ongoing work; the inferred Hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear early, and the gauge constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Specificity is purposeful, such as kelp and shells forming memory maps that affect the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Hybrid lens, from gauge adjustment to pattern creation and equation delivery, with cost legible in the revitalization surge and serene upheaval. Stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope emerges through events and imagery, not statement, with the equation offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the blood drop and balloon expansion, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of logical dreamer, trial balloons, and parallel timelines, transforming tropes with specific details. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
