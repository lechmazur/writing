<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation to "incise the day" and quantify absence is clear and consistent, driving key choices under pressure. Her final self-subtraction is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her transformation into a door. However, interior contradiction is subtle, leaning on thematic resonance rather than deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the vendor becomes a door, enabling new stories while sacrificing herself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and patterns. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of customers stepping through her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and its elements (crystal fruit, bottles, scale) constrain choices and charge the closure, such as the library tilting with shifted memories. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the vendor's POV, with micro-setting deeply integrated into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the vendor's agency—raising prices, trading absences—leading to heavier branches and cracked clouds. Cost is unmistakable in the orchard's weight and her self-subtraction, tightening stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as absence mapping stories, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the vendor's transformation, reweighting prior material with profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control, evident in lines like "brass doors exhaled." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful, supporting the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating toward closure without muddle, as in the final bottle shattering into letters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes absence quantification and magical realism with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes like second chances. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
