<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation crystallizes clearly from curiosity to purposeful action, with embodied transformation (e.g., "her eyesight sharpening") that earns her final choice. Micro-choices under pressure, like prodding the leaf and releasing the moonstone, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory, slightly limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the sky accepting offerings and Mireya's new role, a Conceptual Repricing under an accumulative lens. The drive lens holds through pattern density (monuments building, leaves spiraling). Orientation is immediate, and the moonstone's warmth as a persistent constraint shapes tactics toward the decisive release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the ashen skyborne arbor forces action via rising leaves, and micro-settings like the cedar chest and lichened branch charge the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "leaves never touched soil," "smelled of peat") are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mireya's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal decoding to collective restoration, driven by Mireya's agency under the accumulative lens (e.g., building monuments alters leaf behavior). Cost is legible in her transformation and the grove's equilibrium shift. One meaningful tightening—the leaves rising faster—reweights options without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as dialogue emerges through particulars like monuments to "laughter of extinct starlings," avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the mirrored arbor, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images (e.g., moonstone burst) and folklore adjustment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "pollen spirals," "root whispers"). Rhythmic control under pressure, such as the hush descriptions, supports accumulative drive. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., prophecy as dialogue) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language ("like pale moths") is consistent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds") slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skyborne arbor, monuments to forgotten things, and folklore feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., "moonstone cabochon dust speck") anchor universals, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
