<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's embodied numbness and Zero's detached resignation are concretely rendered through micro-choices under pressure; the final merger is earned by prior causality, with the cost of lost selves felt in the survivor's composite emotions. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as Mara's ache of absence versus her reach for connection, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—the dissolution of individual identities into a synthesis—under a consistent Causal lens; the custody ritual's escalation through confession rounds narrows options organically, and the persistent constraint of rewriting history shapes tactics until the merger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting Pacific charge the final image, while the brain in a jar constrains key choices; sensory details like "creaking bamboo" and "glowing fluid" are selective and purposeful, reflecting urgency and POV bias without generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from confession rounds to Mara's decisive pull toward merger; the cost is legible in the dissolution of selves and the child's inherited memories, foreclosing other paths with visible emotional trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges through specific events—the ritual, merger, and paradox—without moralizing; the ending's resonant, non-literal answer ("only by holding the opposite do we become real") reweights prior material through image and action, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("history crashed over them like a wave"); dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, and purposeful compression (e.g., "vivify the child") is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("pale jellyfish," "narrative fog") is coherent and purposeful, and peak beats like the merger maintain clarity and propulsion with zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cloning, ego death, and rewriting history with non-obvious ingenuity; the merger feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on identity and parenthood.</comment>
