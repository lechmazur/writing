<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. His internal conflict and embodied emotions, such as the cold key tag "like a muted bell," reveal character-particular interiority. The final choice to light lamps with new tints is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when Jin realizes sound is light searching for an eye, reconfiguring his quest. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and pattern. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in the final image of lamps burning with different tints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "copper echo onto the water" and the sunken ship's "broken ribs" constraining choices. The environment charges the final image, as the library's resonance directly shapes Jin's discovery and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with Jin's hunt for sound's color, escalating under the accumulative lens as he dives deeper and finds the phonograph. Agency is clear in his purposeful wandering and use of the key, with cost felt in his transformed perception. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cylinder reveals the spectrum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as vows staying luminous, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization that sound is light, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the woman's vanishing and the plankton cloud.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "meteor hush thickened into velvet." Voice modulates under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the woman's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, though slight overwriting risk exists in stacked metaphors. No loops or scaffold obscure clarity; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific details like the sunken library and color of sound. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
