<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the forgotten bag and grafting the beam. Her persistence feels earned, and the final stance crystallization (barring the elders) has visible cost. The daughter's appearance adds relational depth without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as the ribbon rots and the orchard persists, under an accumulative/textural lens. The plot coheres with clear causality from the breach to the healing, and orientation is anchored early. The final image of the unspoken covenant charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the cathedral orchard constraining choices (e.g., grafting on rafters) and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "sunlight poured through the absent rose window") are filtered through the mender's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival) escalates through the mender's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as she uses the bag and grafts the beam. Cost is legible in the transformation of the ribbon and her persistence, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of generational wisdom and forgiveness emerges through concrete particulars (e.g., scrolls in figs, ribbon absorption) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the coconut and copper fragrance, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature tied to the mender's profession (e.g., "quartz monocle flashing"). POV is stable, and elision (e.g., the bag's contents) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story through varied rhythm and concrete imagery. No major artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the grafting scene. Sentence-level propulsion maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis of elements (cathedral orchard, deciduous vows), transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
