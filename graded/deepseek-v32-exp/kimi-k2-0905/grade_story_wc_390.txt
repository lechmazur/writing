<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like changing the bowing pattern. Her final decision to weave a third path is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in the dilemma between saving the artifact or the town. The cost is visible in her tears and the worn key, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: the Echo is healed, shadows dissolved, and marina intact, under a Hybrid drive lens. Cost is legible in Mireya's tears and the key's wear, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the drift-ice marina pressuring choices through ice calving and the key constraining tactics. Sensory details like "ice knocked together, producing a low, mournful chord" are selective and purposeful. The environment charges the final image, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mireya's agency under the Hybrid lens, as the cracking Echo and calving ice force her to adapt her vibrational matching. Cost is unmistakable in the worn key and emotional release. The stakes tighten meaningfully, with one dominant stake and a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as "teaching darkness to listen," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mercy and adaptation. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, without moralizing. The final image of stars as a spiral reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable single POV and perceptual signature reflected in phrases like "fleshly ethereal." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "sunset bled across the horizon" is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of sonic absolution and vibrational matching, transforming tropes through specific details like the crypt keeper's key. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
