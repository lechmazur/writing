<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inspector's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; micro-choices under pressure (e.g., setting chemical alarms) reveal values, and the final photographing action is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in "her voice cracked," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of the fossilized anemones. Orientation is clear early, and the sand grain timer persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., terminator wind triggers reactions) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "vitrified regolith that glittered like shattered glass."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (documenting extinction) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist agency (waiting, photographing); cost is legible in the anemones' folding and the grain's blush, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mourning and curiosity emerges through particulars (e.g., stolen sand grain, fossil imprint) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; purposeful elision (e.g., "purposefully curious") is taught and paid off, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "translucent polyps that opened only once every seven years," advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction documentation with specific details (chemical alarms, lunar setting) feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is grounded in character.</comment>
