<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., spitting into dust as "combative tenderness"). Her final decision to mentor the child is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict about exile is dramatized. The child's arrival adds relational pressure without flattening Lira's agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens: the library exhales and the teacup's circle symbolizes resilience, with cost legible in Lira remembering for both. The drive lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The reversible exile concept shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the library's shelves shifting like ribs and the imprisoned shadow charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the teacup and swing's ghost acting as micro-settings that deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile and mentorship) escalates through Lira's agency, driven by tea leaf reading and the child's arrival. Cost is unmistakable in her decision to remember for both, foreclosing a path under the accumulative lens. Pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through particulars like the teacup's circle and walking backwards, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., Lira pointing to the shadow) and images that reweight prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lira, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression (e.g., "walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "combative tenderness toward her own fate" is slightly dense but not obstructive). Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, with reversible exile and shard-mirror archivist offering a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and turns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
