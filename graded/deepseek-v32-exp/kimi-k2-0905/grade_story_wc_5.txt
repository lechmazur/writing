<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion shown through physical patience. His final renunciation to stay is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost: "he knew he would never leave." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting pressures choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "frost into perfect circles" being selective and purposeful. The orchard and crater constrain tactics and evolve causally, becoming a "living score" at closure. Specificity is high without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the alchemist's agency under the accumulative lens, such as sealing the plate, which narrows options and leads to the orchard's response. The cost is legible in his decision to stay, and the dominant stake of mapping heartbeats tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, like the "marriage of sky-light and earth-metal," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and memory. Subtext operates in silence and patterns, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. Rhythm and diction control heighten the accumulative effect, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly overwritten in places, but propulsion remains strong. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes alchemy, heartbeats, and maps in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the concept. Authenticity of vision is clear, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
