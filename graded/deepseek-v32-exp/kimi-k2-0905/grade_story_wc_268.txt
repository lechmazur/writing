<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (balance over revenge), with micro-choices under pressure (whispering the clue) revealing his values. Interiority is concrete, embodied in actions like searching and leaving messages, and the final unmasking is earned by prior causality with visible cost (glamour unraveling). However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (pretender exposed) with felt cost (library sighing, dust motes rising), under a Causal drive lens upheld throughout. Orientation is clear early (titan in temple library), and the plot's because/therefore linkages (titan's actions lead to unmasking) are tight, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (ancient temple library, leaning shelves) and constrains choices (balustrades, codex access), charging the final image (rafters leaning, shelves bowing). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered (marble skin glowing, dust), with spatial choreography coherent and atmosphere enhancing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking false king) escalates under the Causal lens via titan's agency (leaving messages, whispering clue), narrowing options to a climax with legible cost (glamour sundered, pretender stripped). Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truth, balance, illusion) emerges organically from events and images (dust motes as liberated subjects, final message), offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, but some elements (stone lions) edge toward overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable (third-person limited on titan) with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, rhythmic prose like "moonlit alabaster"). Voice modulates under pressure (whispered clue, declarative climax), and elision (e.g., time skips) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (e.g., "ink pellet flew to him" advancing plot) and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, though slightly overwritten in peaks ("graceful collapse" risks mild abstraction). Sentence propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fantasy tropes with fresh specificity (diminutive titan using library marginalia), transforming familiar elements through grounded choices. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
