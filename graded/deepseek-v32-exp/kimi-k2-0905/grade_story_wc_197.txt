<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her belief in words, with interiority shown through embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure, such as timing drones and sprinting barefoot. Her final decision to broadcast is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her capture risk. Contradictory impulses of determination and fear are implied but not deeply explored in scene, limiting the score slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with coherent because/therefore linkages, from Mira's discovery to the broadcast. Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration as voices are unleashed and officers hesitate, cost felt in Mira's implied capture. Orientation is early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the key and booth constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the auric lagoon and puddle reflections guiding Mira's choices and charging the final image of a new map. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her POV, constraining action and enhancing atmosphere. The phone booth as micro-setting directly affects the climax, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes against indifference are signaled early and escalate through Mira's agency under causal lens, such as her timing the drones and wiring the broadcast. Cost is legible in her risk of capture and the emotional impact on officers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to broadcast, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges organically through images like the key and puddles, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the map of voices, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, such as the key symbolizing unlocking forgotten histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates under pressure, seen in rhythmic descriptions like "starlight braided into copper." Elision is purposeful, such as the retired switchman's pixelation, taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with vivid imagery advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats like the broadcast. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages doesn't harm clarity or closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of revised histories via phone booth is fresh and non-obvious, transformed through specific details like magnetic reels and puddle maps. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
