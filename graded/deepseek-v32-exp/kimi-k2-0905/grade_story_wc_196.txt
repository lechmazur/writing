<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete, embodied emotion like "heart stuttered." Her internal conflict between practical stipend and emotional hope drives micro-choices, such as placing the button in Marcus's file, earning the final Charged Poise with visible cost in feeling "lighter." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like past wounds compound into credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns (dust, button) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Rowan reconfigures the unknown as a "hallway" with felt cost in hope. Orientation is clear early; closure lands on-page with cost in the snow image magnifying light, and persistent constraint of unknown histories shapes tactics. No causality breaks; structure is coherent and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "mildew and closingtime" filtered through Rowan's POV. The file room as micro-setting constrains choices (finding button, reading dust) and charges the final image of history "rerouted." Spatial choreography is clear; details evolve with action, avoiding clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of magnifying small kindnesses escalates through Rowan's agency under Accumulative lens: finding button, interpreting dust, and placing it in file foreclose personal connection with cost in emotional weight. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully; resolution is earned by her alteration, with cost legible in the promise of the hallway image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like dust patterns and button, with subtext in images (snow magnifying light) offering a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption. No moralizing; ending reweights prior material through the hallway metaphor, embracing complexity without tidy resolution. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Rowan, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, reflective voice ("tactfully hopeful"). Rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping. Diction remains within character lexicon; purposeful elision (e.g., dust reading) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., light unfurling "like sunrise over a battlefield"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion support closure. Read-aloud test passes smoothly; syntax and word choice are controlled and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archivist, foster care, and historical artifact feels inevitable, with unique elements like dust reading transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative premises, offering a fresh angle on redemption.</comment>
