<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia and artistic struggle are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling to examine shells) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final transformation—insomnia as gift—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the exchange and painting. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her wry earnestness warring with despair, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Mara's insomnia repriced as vigilance, costing her prior self-view. The lens holds through pattern density (rain trails, brooch warmth), and orientation is clear by ~120 words. The final image of sleeping deeply with spirals charges the convergence with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the tidal island's receding tide pressures Mara's path, and the monastery's flooded frescoes shape her painting. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "rain trails ribboned down basalt"), filtered through her raw-eyed POV, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in the exchange and painting, deepening the stake of meaning-threshing with cost legible in her insomnia transformed. The old woman's presence complicates without resolving, and one meaningful tightening (brooch response to shells) narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the brooch and shell spirals, with subtext in gestures (e.g., the pottery shard exchange). The ending offers a non-literal answer through Mara's dream, reweighting loss and found meaning without moralizing, and emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Mara's exhausted gaze ("rain trails ribboned"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in modulated syntax, and purposeful elision (e.g., the water wars' details) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "monastery like a broken tooth"), though minor register drift in "wryly earnest" occurs but doesn't harm closure. Sentence rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes post-apocalyptic memory exchange with ecological themes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The core premise offers a fresh angle, and risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
