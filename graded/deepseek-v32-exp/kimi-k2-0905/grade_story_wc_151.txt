<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to mail the unsigned letter is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Micro-choices, like smudging chalk, reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in her choice to remain unread. Accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by time pressure from the drone. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, filtering through POV to pressure choices (e.g., drone arrival). The golden arcade and chalk codes constrain actions and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with details like neon signs and marble pillars integrated into action. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anonymity vs. authenticity) escalates under accumulative lens through time pressure and internal conflict. Protagonist agency drives tightening, culminating in a decision with visible cost (mailing one letter, keeping the other). No coincidence or static conflict; cost is legible in the erasure of chalk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of identity emerges through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in gestures like chalk blurring. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her choice, reweighting prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermonizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., chalk codes) is taught and paid off. Dialogue absent, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no muddle in peak beats. Rhythm supports momentum, and closure image is clear. No paraphrase loops or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes pseudonym creation with futuristic nostalgia in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details (e.g., chalk gateway) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template plots or derivative echoes.</comment>
