<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are vividly embodied, with his transformation earned through causality. The girl, while enigmatic, functions as a crucible, but her mystical nature borders on stock, slightly limiting depth. The final choice to accept the sphere is motivated and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the sandbar revelation and coachman's change land with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early, and the palimpsest promise persistently shapes tactics. The ending image of the meadow reweights prior material with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the fog-bound river crossing constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's POV. The coach's dissolution and sandbar emergence alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase—the ticking gutters and sinking crossing tighten pressure. Coachman's agency in threading the needle and walking the plank drives escalation, with cost legible in the coach's erasure. However, the girl's role slightly diminishes protagonist-driven tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of distillation emerges organically through events and imagery, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sphere and transformed coachman, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the coachman's mind under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops. Figurative language is consistent but occasionally dense in peak beats, causing minor clarity drag. Closure remains unaffected, and syntax supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical and mundane elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices, like the yarn needle and palimpsest promise. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
