<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., frost melting into tears). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but internal conflict is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as vows decay into data stored in the tree. Causality is tight, and orientation is clear early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices (e.g., cold affecting actions) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's measurement under Accumulative lens; cost is legible as vows fade, narrowing options and deepening stakes with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss of meaning without moralizing, supported by subtext in vows' decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic rhythm; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., vows' transformation) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing abstract concepts with grounded details; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
