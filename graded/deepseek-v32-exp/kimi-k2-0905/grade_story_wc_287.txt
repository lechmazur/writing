<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her wistful pragmatism. The final choice to teach the boy gardening is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared moment. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the boy's internal change and the nasturtium rooting.

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reflecting light into dark corners) escalates through Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the rooftop scene with legible cost.
