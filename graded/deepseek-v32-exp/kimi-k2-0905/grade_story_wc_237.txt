<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., "lungs burned," "crystallized breath") and micro-choices (timing the rune) that reveal internal conflict. Her final release is earned by prior causality, foreclosing grief with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (rock drifts higher, quill snaps). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density and memory. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the superstition shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (e.g., no railing forces trust, kettle timing pressures rune). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("tea-dark lake," "storm clouds stacked like bruised shelves"). The floating rock and quill charge the final image with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lina's agency under the Accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the rune-drawing and typhoon. Cost is legible in the crystallized breath shattering and emotional release. One meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake of transforming grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images (e.g., spiral rune releasing air, broken quill). Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with a resonant, non-literal answer to grief. No moralizing; complexity lingers through particulars like the brother's laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific (e.g., "crystallized breath," "falling moon frozen mid-plunge"). Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "minute needles") doesn't harm clarity. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic, grief, and ceremony feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., crow quill, powdered jade) avoid cliché. Transformation test passes; the core premise is fresh and fully committed.</comment>
