<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, with embodied interiority and a credible earned transformation when she accepts the crown; her confession "I inspect tombs because I am afraid of living rooms" reveals flawed, contradictory impulses that charge the final choice with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory and emotional density; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara integrates with the cave, with cost legible in her physical transformation and eternal role, anchored early and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal caves are indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., pearl reacting to walls) and charging the final image; sensory details like "mineral tears" and "rainbows trapped in mid-sob" are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dissolving emotional walls escalates accumulatively through confessions and pearl's guidance; Mara's agency in taking the crown drives a meaningful deepening with cost legible in her transformation, foreclosing her previous life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief and connection emerges organically through confessions and imagery; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's eternal role, without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of her "polishing abandoned hopes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Mara's biased observations, and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "the cave seemed to breathe in resonant hush") supports accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "stalactites hung like frozen chords" is purposeful and coherent, and propulsion remains clear even in peak beats such as the crown scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of doomsday inspection with mystical collective memory feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded particulars.</comment>
