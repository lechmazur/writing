<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., sister's heartbeat quickening, sigh). Internal conflict shown through contradictory impulses in stride. Final choice to recite the name is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the sinking ship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the sister's sigh and ship sinking. Inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural, held throughout. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of fusion shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., maze navigation, card guidance) and charging the final image with the sinking ship. Sensory details are selective and integrated, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the dissolution and sinking. Dominant stake of finding the name tightens through gathering fragments, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of identity and unity emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the garden rooting in her mouth. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical, poetic syntax; perceptual signature is clear. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Syntax varies naturally, supporting rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with fresh synthesis of chimera twins and carnival mythos. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
