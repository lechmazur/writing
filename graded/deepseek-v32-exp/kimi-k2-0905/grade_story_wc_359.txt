<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His synesthesia and internal conflict (e.g., tasting childhood fear) are concrete, and his final choice to swallow the sheet is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in becoming a "living document." Minor hairline slip in limited internal contradiction, but closure is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, with Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing on-page, as Elian's internalization of the sheet reweights wonder with felt cost ("ready to testify"). Structure is single-scene with coherent escalation; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with sensory details (e.g., violet ripples, blue-green light) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The ice cavern and Echoless Vein pressure tactics, and micro-elements like the bells and amber sheet are purposeful. Economy and POV filter are excellent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) is signaled early and escalates under Accumulative lens through Elian's agency (e.g., facing the Vein, ringing bells). Cost is unmistakable in his transformation, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential infrastructure emerges through events and images (e.g., silence kneeling, sheet dissolution) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (synesthesia-driven observation). Voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Diction remains within character lexicon, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "heartbeat orbited him like a cautious moon"). Sentences advance story; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details (prism-song, echoless vein). Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and originality are high, supporting closure.</comment>
