<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen's motivation to transpose his life is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through micro-choices like palming the film and deciding to leave. His contradictory impulses as spy and sage are dramatized under pressure, and his final departure is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The keeper applies secondary pressure, but Chen's agency dominates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure in Chen's departure reconfiguring his identity through a resonant image of the skiff shrinking. Cost is legible on-page in the keeper's realization and Chen's whispered lines. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with taught patterns like the prophetic fortune.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, with the lighthouse and rocky island pressuring choices through the light as exposure tool and the island as lithophone. Sensory details like "moonlit combers smash the granite spine" are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the humming spine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Chen's desire for freedom escalates through his agency under the accumulative lens, from writing the fortune to orchestrating his disappearance. Cost is felt in his abandonment of identity and the keeper's loss, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses his old life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of open secrets and transformation emerge organically from events and images, like the light confessing and the fortune's prophecy. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Chen's departure and the island's hum, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature in Chen's spycraft-poetic perspective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision like the microdot use is taught and paid off. Rhythm and diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm advancing story. No loops or artifacts; figurative language like "negatives developing in a tray" is voice-consistent and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of espionage, prophecy, and lighthouse setting feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the microdot specs. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure reweights prior material with freshness.</comment>
