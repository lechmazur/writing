<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values, such as balancing on the rafters to learn trust. The final choice to leave is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Mirela's departure and the dust motes' chord). Cost is legible in the meteorite chip pulsing with her mother's lullaby, and orientation is clear early. Structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the attic rafters forcing balance, and charges the final image with the skylight's dust motes. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mirela's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memories and evading capture escalates through Mirela's agency, such as cataloging the attic and releasing pigeons. Cost is unmistakable in her departure, foreclosing options under the accumulative lens with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through particulars like the meteorite chip and dust motes, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending image. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., her past) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "blooming withering light") but no muddle in peak beats, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, meteorite chip, lost songs) feels inevitable and heightens stakes. Risk-taking in lyric style coheres without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
