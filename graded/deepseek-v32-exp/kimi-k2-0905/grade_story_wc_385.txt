<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her final choice to complete the farewell is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the cocoon's dissolution. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her gift feeling like a curse, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Lira completes her mother's farewell, costing the dissolution of the cocoon and reconfiguring her understanding of echoes. The Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to resolution, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraint of echoes shapes tactics, and cost is legible in "the cocoon dissolved into motes of quiet light."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "scent of wet copper" filtering through Lira's perception. The serpentine nexus and seashell constrain choices and charge the final image, as the cavern directly enables the climax. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Causal lens, from curiosity to descending into the nexus and actively completing the farewell. Dominant stake of avoiding hollow echoes tightens through meaningful turns, with cost unmistakable in the cocoon's release. Protagonist's alteration forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished departures emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the old woman's reveal. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's realization and the portable seashell, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled rhythm under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., progressive disclosure) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Lira's lexicon, enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with lyrical yet concise sentences advancing story. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally, and syntax supports emotional beats. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peaks like "cocoon dissolved into motes."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of echo mythology and closure, transformed via specific character choices and world logic. Emotional truth in the mother-daughter dynamic feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes without gimmickry. Premise commits fully, resisting template plots.</comment>
