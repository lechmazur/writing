<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation is clear and rooted in preserving wonder, with internal conflict shown through accepting contradictions; actions align with motives, and the final choice to plant the creel is earned with visible cost in the hollow absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative lens, with cost legible in the roots sprouting and hollow adjustment; orientation is early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices, with sensory details filtered through POV; the tidal atrium and creel constrain actions and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving wonder escalate under accumulative lens through lunar pressure and protagonist's agency in smelting identities; cost is unmistakable in the planting and future forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, with subtext in contradictions; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature blending mechanical and mystical elements; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and clear, though minor abstractness prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the gear librarian and smelting process; risk-taking in abstract prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
