<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., pulse matching the storm) and micro-choices under pressure (planting the seed, guiding growth). Her final embrace of the mutation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the cyclical transformation. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the empty envelope realization, reweighting the premise with cost (ongoing mutation). Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (seed planting triggers labyrinth change). Orientation is clear early (Mira, mill, stormy night), and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (soil under glass floor) and charges the final image (brook flowing backward). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered (e.g., brook's hush, cold air from cavity). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency (planting seed, guiding growth). Cost is legible in the labyrinth's transformation and cyclical future. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seed's growth realigns the mill, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events (seed mail, transformation) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to innovation cycles via the empty envelope realization. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., note in own handwriting).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, rhythmic prose). Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "storm-born silence" to "vegetal pulse"). No head-hopping; elision (fugue state) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated ("roots erupted outward, not downward"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs (e.g., sprint to control room). No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes escape room realism with magical surrealism in a fresh, inevitable way. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (corpse flower as puzzle catalyst). Risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
