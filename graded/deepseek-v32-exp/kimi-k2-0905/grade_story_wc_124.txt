<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "pressure behind the eyes"). Micro-choices like uncapping the vial reveal his values, and his final shift to brokering scents is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Elian transitions from light to scent, felt cost in grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and the transformation completes with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with ultraviolet light revealing scents and the ghost orchid responding. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his emotional collapse and transformation. The dominant stake of grieving tightens through memory triggers, foreclosing his previous path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, such as the perfume vial and orchid, offering a resonant non-literal answer on grief and memory. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is clear in Elian's biased observations, and elision is purposeful, teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats, though minor density may challenge some readers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing olfactory collapse and grief into an organic whole. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
