<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices like spectral vision splitting. However, slight lack of deep internal contradiction limits the score, though actions align consistently with traits and stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost (time pressure and danger), causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent time constraint shapes tactics throughout, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., gravity inversion dictates movement), with sensory detail integrated into action. The grotto as micro-setting charges the final image by sealing dark, reinforcing stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring memory) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost legible in time crunch and seed threats. One meaningful tightening occurs as inversion wanes, forcing rushed choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and cycles emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in "latent blaze" and final resonance without moralizing. Ending reweights prior material through Ilyra's success and cyclical promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (prism-minded filtering), and voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in spectral vision pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and advances momentum, e.g., "droplets a tiny lantern," and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of gravity inversion and archival magic, transformed through specific details like the doodle compass. Risk-taking in conceptual world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
