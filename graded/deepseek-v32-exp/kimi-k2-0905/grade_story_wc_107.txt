<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply nuanced, with clear motives rooted in grief and a contemplative nature. Her internal conflict is embodied through specific actions like narrating tasks and using the bookmark, showing contradictory impulses. The final choice to leave the dome is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional thaw. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through imagery and Mara's internal shifts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she abandons the dome, reweighting her relationship with grief with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern pays off at the end. Persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like drip-lines and metallic scents, integral to pressure and choices. The control room and thawing ice constrain actions, providing resources for the dome. Micro-setting elements like the bookmark charge the final image. Specificity avoids cliché and supports the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict with grief escalates through accumulative density, driven by Mara's agency in actions like breaking the chair and leaving the dome. Cost is legible in her emotional realignment. Under the textural lens, a single meaningful deepening reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing and safe inquiry emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in objects like the dome and bookmark, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through Mara's departure. Resonance arises from particulars, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature filtered through Mara's bias. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in narrated tasks. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "heart loosening like ice." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing, grief, and abandoned tech feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details like magnetic tape as reinforcement transform familiar tropes. Fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration avoids derivative premises.</comment>
