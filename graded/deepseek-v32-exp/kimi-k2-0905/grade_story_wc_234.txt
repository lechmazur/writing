<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corin's motivation to capture presence is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in lines like "his voice cracking like cooling magma." His final choice to crush the pocket-sun is earned by prior causality, showing a credible renunciation with visible cost. Mira's relationship forces a decisive change, and internal contradiction is handled in scene without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Corin crushes the pocket-sun, reweighting presence through shared light; cost is legible in the transformed shell and shared warmth. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in imagery tightening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the ember nexus and volcanic glass constraining choices and charging the final image where light "made the volcanic glass sing." Sensory details reflect POV bias, and the nautilus shell evolves to shape closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Corin's agency under the accumulative lens, from confession to crushing the pocket-sun, narrowing options with cost in the shared moment. Dominant stake (capturing vs. sharing presence) is signaled early and deepens through Mira's response. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the shell's spiral and crushed pocket-sun, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to presence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, e.g., Mira's "by returning differently." Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete image and complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending scientific and romantic diction. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as in Mira's rehearsed casualness. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "shadow of the obsidian archway" is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, though minor register drift in "scientifically romantic" slightly impacts peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of alchemy and emotion, with the pocket-sun concept transformed through specific choices. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative premises; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
