<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Queen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingering the torn map," "trembling"). Final choice to accept the crown is earned by prior causality, with visible cost of memory loss. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hesitation versus drive to climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens holds; closure is a Decisive Change with cost legible on-page ("burn the last of her living memory"). Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (memory erosion) shapes tactics. Causality is tight, with dreams motivating climb and realization of loop leading to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., grotto's paradox influences queen's decision). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "lacey menace" wrapping lungs). Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by queen's agency under Hybrid lens, from blurred reflection to crown acceptance, with cost unmistakable (memory sacrifice). Stakes are signaled early and tighten through causal turns, narrowing options. No coincidence in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time loops emerges from events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through acceptance of the loop. Subtext operates in imagery (e.g., bleeding starlight as memory). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating under pressure (e.g., rhythmic prose in climax). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., dream details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and supports mood (e.g., "bleeding starlight coagulating"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of time loop and memory with specific details; tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., queen's sacrifice). Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
