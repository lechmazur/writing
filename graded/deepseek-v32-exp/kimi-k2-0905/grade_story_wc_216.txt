<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., rubbing the urn fragment). The final realization about exchanging sensations is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the texture shift inside his ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "the texture shift inside his ribs." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald silo and objects like price tags constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., dust motes) are selective and reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, from silo exploration to garage sale exchange, with cost unmistakable in the texture shift. Dominant stake (understanding time) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in object descriptions (e.g., price tags as narratives). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "horizon spilled green wheat like an unabridged novel"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, enhancing subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story purposefully, and closure is clear without artifacts harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details like garage sale messages. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
