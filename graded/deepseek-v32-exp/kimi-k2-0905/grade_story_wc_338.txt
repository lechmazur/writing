<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in empathy, driving her choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "hush that curled inside her ribs like warm smoke"); her final renunciation of translation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the knitted map.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (silence as an "inked continent"); accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern density; orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the final image of the map knitting and her smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (chapel door reopening based on stillness) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rain hissing, fresco peeling); micro-setting (projector, map) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under accumulative lens (comparing footage, touching stone); cost is legible in her realization and the map's transformation; dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (map tears, door openings) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("silence was not absence but a map framed upside-down"); subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature ("rain hissed against the tarp"); voice is poetic and controlled under pressure; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., footage comparison) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear ("dark mouth about to whisper"); sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence, maps, and empathy feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet plot heightens stakes; specific details (fresco layers, video footage) avoid cliché; transformation test passed.</comment>
