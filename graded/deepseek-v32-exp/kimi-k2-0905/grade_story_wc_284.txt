<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., kneeling despite pain) revealing hierarchy of values. Final choice to transmit data and destroy pillbox is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (transmission and destruction of pillbox) with felt cost in scar tissue and walking away. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (Zephyr Bluff, mist, snow) constrains choices and charges the final image (snowdrop as receiver); sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing corruption and redemption) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost legible in injuries and transmission risk. One meaningful tightening (accessing station and transmitting) narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of courage and redemption emerges through events and images (pillbox, snowdrop) without moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer via the snowdrop and signal traveling, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, though minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "dying star flinging its atoms") doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar spy tropes with fresh specificity (pillbox micro-code, snow remembers); risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
