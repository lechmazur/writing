<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her changeless constancy, intensifying under pressure to compel her final choice to leave. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling the "luminous ache" and micro-choices like sealing the clock hand. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her smile and the photograph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Conceptual Repricing as Mira realizes the observatory was a darkroom developing her leaving, with felt cost in the "gentle drag of memory." The Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery, and structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting is indispensable, constraining choices like using the camera and charging the final image as it "folded inward." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with the leaf and vacuum enhancing atmosphere. Micro-setting elements like the camera alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harnessing the ephemeral escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases like the shaking and clock hand spinning. Mira's agency in restructing herself drives the climax, with cost legible in her departure and the observatory's collapse. One meaningful deepening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and letting go emerges organically from events and images, such as the leaf and photograph, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's realization, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice reflective of Mira's perception, such as "luminous ache" and "changelessly constant." Rhythm and syntax control under pressure, with purposeful elision taught early. No head-hopping; internal voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "observatory itself was a camera." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing surreal elements like the leaf in vacuum with emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative design pays off with inevitability, and specificity anchors universals. The final image feels fresh and transforms familiar themes of time and loss.</comment>
