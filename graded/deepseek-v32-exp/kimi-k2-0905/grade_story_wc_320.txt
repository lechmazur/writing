<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in her mandate, with embodied emotions like tears at the climax. Final choice to tune the shard is earned through discarding assumptions, showing micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the shard dissolves and voices return, reconfiguring meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and lunar perigee acts as a persistent constraint. The final image of the gorge whispering upward charges the ending with conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the abandoned radio tower city and gorge pressuring choices through swaying and lunar gravity. Sensory details like "antennas humming" are purposeful, and the environment constrains the climax by balancing the city at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing the shard from eating transmissions escalates through protagonist's agency in discarding assumptions and tuning. Cost is legible in her emotional realization and the tower's balance. Under Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically through events and imagery, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "every quiet is merely rehearsal," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control and perceptual signature like "dust motes drifted in slow-motion waltzes." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure with the final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "shard of hush slid toward it like a cat to a hearth." Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like the shard of hush and Hollywood star fragment feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style that heightens stakes. Transformation of silence from threat to cocoon is grounded in specific details and charges closure.</comment>
