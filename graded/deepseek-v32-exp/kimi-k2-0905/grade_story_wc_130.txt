<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., reciting primes instead of crying) and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to plant seedlings and move forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting ambiguous loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Conceptual Repricing where the astrolabe and seedlings reconfigure grief into motion. Cost is legible in the protagonist's acceptance of loss, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of the orchard shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the cavern orchard and mosaic stepping stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with stakes of resolving ambiguous loss tightening through actions like using the glass eyes and astrolabe. Cost is unmistakable in the acceptance of loss and renewal of the orchard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief as mathematics emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in implication, such as the integral sign cradling a heart, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., patterned imagery) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language enhances clarity in peak beats, such as "mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion," without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of mathematics, emotion, and loss, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with specific details like the astrolabe and seedlings.</comment>
