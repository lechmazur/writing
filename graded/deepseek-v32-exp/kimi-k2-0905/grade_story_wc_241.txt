<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in contradictory impulses, such as her theoretical rebellion versus her inherited mind, embodied in micro-choices like opening the diary. Her final bet on herself is earned through the causal discovery of her father's wagers, with cost visible in her tight throat and widened perspective. Emotions are concrete and avoid diagnostic speak, though minor summarization in peak beats slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Mira's realization of "the lattice of love beneath the ruin," under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The lantern and scrawls form a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear within 120 words. No causality breaks; the diary reveal tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the library's "clover melancholy" and lantern's mica pane fracture light, guiding Mira's epiphany. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the basement atmosphere pressuring the discovery. The object-as-setting (lantern) evolves across beats, irreplaceable for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as interpreting scrawls and reading the diary deepen stakes toward the climax. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and the forfeiture of pages, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs with the diary's final entry, forcing a trade-off in her perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the scrawls and diary entries, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "Bet on yourself" without moralizing. Subtext operates in images (lantern's light) and contradictions, reweighting prior material. The ending avoids abstraction, rooted in Mira's specific struggle and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that modulates under pressure ("fracturing it into a spectrum"). Rhythm and syntax control heighten tension without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., diary contents) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery, and closure is undulled by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of probability, gambling, and cryptic messages, transformed through specific details like the father's equations. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The integration feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding templates.</comment>
