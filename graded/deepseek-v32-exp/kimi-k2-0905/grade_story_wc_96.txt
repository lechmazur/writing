<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's characterization is deeply embodied with internal conflict, such as his trembling new skin and jagged words, and his transformation to "lantern-bearer" is earned through prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure, like showing the coffee tin and rebuilding with Marin, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Marin applies secondary pressure, and their relationship evolves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter the library's fate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages, from molting to confrontation with Rourke, and closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Lark's settled identity and the library's preservation. Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image of "patrons carrying paper wings" reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as using warped shelves to build a spiral nest, and charges the closure with the image of cranes in dictionaries. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lark's POV, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from personal molting to collective resistance, with a meaningful tightening when Rourke enters and they use clever tactics to save the library. Cost is legible in the risk of capture and the transformation of Lark's identity, narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "beauty from anarchy" emerges organically through actions and images like the paper cranes and rebuilt shelves, without direct statement, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of resistance. Subtext operates in gestures and symbols, such as the coffee tin representing recycled selves, inviting reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lark, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure, such as in the description of "luminous fracture against iron." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges about "tasting the bones," and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language, like "pages scatter like startled doves," is coherent and purposeful, and rhythm accelerates with scene needs, maintaining clarity through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of monthly molting and "blooming resistance" offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in style and premise heightening stakes. Specific details, like the coffee tin with a false bottom, are irreplaceable and integrated into character and conflict, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
