<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices like graffiti painting and stone-stroking, with internal conflict shaping stakes. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, and emotions are rendered without diagnostic labels. The foundation stone chip's recurring use charges her motivation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of unreadable carnival and impending capital return. Hybrid drive lens holds, causality is tight from graffiti to reorganization, and orientation is anchored early. Persistent Syndicate threat shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is indispensable, constraining choices via its physical and social layout. Sensory details like "calliope music" and "popcorn smoke" are filtered through Lina's POV. The foundation stone chip as micro-setting charges the closure by reweighting meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lina's agency under the hybrid lens, from encoded graffiti to midnight assembly and tactical reorganization. Cost is legible in the Syndicate's confusion and the acknowledged postponement of privatization. Stakes tighten meaningfully around survival versus sale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lina's conflicted actions and the carnival's transformation, resisting moralizing. The ending's "we are still becoming" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to gentrification through conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in graffiti symbols and community solidarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, e.g., noticing "colors that felt wrong." Dialogue in the assembly is natural and goal-driven. Compression, like the graffiti encoding, is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "laughter felt like ballast," is purposeful and coherent. No register drift or template cadence obscures closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes raft city carnival and gentrification resistance with fresh, inevitable specificity. Risk-taking in structure (graffiti as communication) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth arises from grounded community details.</comment>
