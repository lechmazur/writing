<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives; her skepticism and academic rebellion drive every choice, culminating in an earned renunciation. Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the amber against the sculpture, reveal contradictory impulses. The final decision to study decay rather than seek home is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost in the tower's collapse and erased footprints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through resonant imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where homecoming is redefined as decay. The cost is legible in the tower's gentle collapse and Mara's inhaled spores, which reconfigure her understanding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the amber's transformation charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower and sculptures constrain Mara's choices and charge the closure, with sensory details like "slick with spring runoff" and "scent of wet lichen" filtered through her POV. The fly amber as a micro-setting object evolves meaning, from map to record, directly shaping the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are purposefully selective, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, such as activating the amber and inhaling spores, which deepens the stake in understanding homecoming. The cost is unmistakable in the tower's collapse and her foreclosed path, reweighting options. Pressure coheres through a single meaningful tightening that narrows her focus from hypothesis to decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the dissolving fly and buried amber, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to homecoming without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Mara not looking back, and the final reconfiguration embraces complexity. The ending's conceptual repricing avoids abstraction, rooted in concrete particulars from the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's scientific lexicon and rhythmic prose under pressure. Purposeful compression, like "like a time-lapse of extinction," is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific, with elision serving the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "Its wings, trapped for forty million years, beat once—then dissolved into a cloud of golden spores" doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and momentum are maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes offworlders, amber as a map, and the chemistry of homecoming with a non-obvious angle, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details like the "cyanotype rinse" scent anchors universals, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
