<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. The final choice to transmit her intention is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her tenderness towards the broken beacon and her longing for connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Charged Poise reconfiguring meaning through the final image of the vibrating cork and changed boat course. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the protagonist's realization about her mother. Persistent constraint of the garden's scent shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt lighthouse and night garden constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "cobalt tower's cool iron door" and scents that purify intentions, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase in sensory patterns and protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in her whispered words and the boat's response, foreclosing options with visible tenderness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the floating cork and lighthouse pulses. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of love and transmission, without moralizing, through the conceptual repricing of her mother's disappearance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, such as noticing "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lyrical syntax, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "dawn bleeding across the horizon," and rhythm varies naturally without obscuring closure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse keeping with vibrational intentions, transformed through specific details like the vial cork and garden scents. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
