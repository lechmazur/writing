<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her obsession with mapping oblivion. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her pulse matching the star's waver. The final choice to step into her outline is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the oracle becomes the first coordinate, with conceptual cost legible in the dissolution of the fort. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building density through imagery and pattern. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the dying star shapes tactics. No causality breaks or orientation penalties apply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "salt-slick stone" and "wind keened," purposefully filtering through the oracle's POV. The storm-tossed ridge fort and gold-leaf booklet constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the fort's stones groaning and the ridge shifting, affecting the oracle's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the oracle's agency under the Accumulative lens, as she races against the dying star to complete the map. The cost is unmistakable when she steps into her outline, foreclosing her path. Pressure coheres and tightens through the thickening hush and dimming star, with one meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the map of absence and the final coordinate, without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to oblivion. The core concept integrates through specific particulars, inviting reflection through purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a consistent single POV and rhythmic control under pressure. The oracle's perceptual signature is selective and biased, evident in lines like "ambered hush" and "extinct suns." Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting in peak beats slightly reduces clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of mapping silence and oblivion, transformed through specific details like the gold-leaf booklet. Risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
