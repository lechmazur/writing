<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in consistent traits and past trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "charcoal in her fingers twitched"); final choice to share blank sheets is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration (completing the painting, lock opening) with felt cost (laughter release, clean fingers); causal-accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (lock date) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (crystal cave) constrains choices and charges the final image (crystals grow along drawing lines); sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., "air tasting of iron and wet pennies"); micro-setting (lock, painting) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict about memory and legacy) escalates through protagonist agency (decision to complete painting); cost is legible in emotional release and behavioral change; one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and forgiveness emerges through events and images (e.g., lock dates, laughter echo); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in implication (e.g., "forgiveness is just memory learning to breathe underwater").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and lyrical; no head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "cave’s auroral sorrow") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with clear propulsion; minor overwriting in dense figurative language but no loops or artifacts harming clarity; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis (mnemonic artist in crystal cave) that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
