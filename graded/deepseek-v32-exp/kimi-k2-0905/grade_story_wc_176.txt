<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in past guilt, with embodied emotion (tears freezing) and micro-choices under pressure (reconfiguring rope) revealing values. Final realization about preservation is earned through causality, with visible cost in emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration closure with legible cost (guilt lifted, voices carried). Causality is tight, linking past actions to present stakes without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (rope reconfiguration in sanctum) and charging the final image with sensory specificity (aurora, ice pylons). Details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) escalates through protagonist's agency in reconfiguring the rope, leading to a climax with visible cost (emotional resonance). Under Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as continuous vibration emerges organically from images (bells, rope, voices) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and any elision (e.g., past events) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor overwriting in peaks slightly reduces propulsion without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (lost wax caster, punched card, ceremonial rope) feels inevitable and fresh, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
