<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's prosopagnosia is a consistent, driving trait that shapes her perception and actions. Embodied emotion is evident in tactile details like "palm against the cold copper." Final realization that her limitation is a filter is earned through on-page causality, with cost in the library's loss. Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing coin indentations, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when. Closure lands with cost in the library's destruction and the painted sky's legacy, per "a fractally precise map of human limitation." Coin's constraints shape tactics throughout, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the tree-trunk library's imminent demolition forces haste, and its hollowed shelves act as a resource. Sensory details like "cold copper" and "vibrations traveling up through root systems" are selective and POV-filtered. Environment constrains the action and charges the final image of the painted sky outlasting destruction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memory escalates under accumulative lens via demolition countdown and her racing against time. Agency is clear in her decision to paint negative space, foreclosing other options with cost felt in the library's loss. Escalation is driven by protagonist's actions, such as working faster as "the building shudders." Cost is unmistakable in the explosion and the painted sky's survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of limitation as strength emerges organically from events, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the coin's note and the negative space painting. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the realization that "identity exists beyond recognition." Concrete particulars, such as the fractal patterns, deepen thematic resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice reflective of the artist's perception. Rhythmic control is evident in phrases like "each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as with the coin's discovery, and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent, filtering details through her prosopagnosia.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Sentences vary rhythmically, e.g., "Her brush, sable and steel, moves across the curved inner wall." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the final explosion. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face-blindness, artistic precision, and architectural doom in a non-obvious way. Specific details like the coin's indentations and tree-trunk library feel organic and irreplaceable. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking, as in the climax where she paints her own face in negative space. Closure reconfigures prior material with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
