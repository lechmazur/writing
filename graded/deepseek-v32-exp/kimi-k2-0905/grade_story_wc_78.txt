<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation to convert obstacles into instruments is clear and consistent, driving key choices; interiority is embodied through sensory actions like striking objects and reading clouds; final agency in the second movement earns the resolution with cost visible in the communal effort and forward movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as the raft moves forward, with cost legible in the transformed silence and collective rhythm; orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and causality coheres under the pattern-based escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the floating orchard and sea mirror constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "clinking buoys" and "petals on parchment" are selective and filtered through the prophet's expertise, enhancing atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming the Doldrum Wall escalates under accumulative lens via prophet's agency, from sketching resonance to striking absence; cost is unmistakable in the rhythmic throbbing and physical movement, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles through resonance emerges organically from events like the cloud interpretations and fractal sound; ending offers a non-literal answer with the orchard as orchestra, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, e.g., "fractal generating" echoes the concept; no head-hopping, and elision like silent intervals is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied syntax and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "clouds in slow arpeggios" is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing sound navigation and floating orchard with specificity; risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
