<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies through sacrificial choices; his interiority is embodied in the hollow chest image, and the final transparency is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in Elian's transparency; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (archway keystone, cobblestones) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (restoring balance) escalates under Accumulative lens via Elian's agency (circuits, sacrifice); cost is unmistakable in his transformation and the town's revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rhythm and sacrifice without moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer via Elian's integration, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlling elision without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "moonlight tastes") but no loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of healing through rhythm; specific details (Tempris, bell sacrifice) and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
