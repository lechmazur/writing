<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thief's motivation (curiosity) is clear and deepens under pressure; interiority is concrete (e.g., hesitation to cut another fragment); final choice to reinterpret using existing portrait is earned with visible cost (lighter satchel, dimmed jar). Contradictory impulses act in scene, and cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change (thief reinterprets without cutting new portrait) and cost (jar dimmed, satchel lighter); causal lens holds tightly (realization leads to action); orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (jar, satchel) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (Emerald Station, moonlight) is vivid and sensory (scent of iron and marigolds); objects (jar, flower codes) constrain choices and charge the final image (petals rearrange into new code); micro-setting pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curiosity vs. cost of thinning tomorrow) signaled early; escalation driven by thief's agency (decision to reinterpret); cost is unmistakable (jar dimmed, reconciliation); one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory, forgiveness) emerges from particulars (thief's realization, merged portraits); subtext in gestures (ring inscription); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("memory is enough") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice is distinct and poetic (e.g., "moth wings" realization); perceptual signature strong (notices pulses, timetables); dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear; rhythm varies naturally; high information density (e.g., jar usage advances plot); no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh (portrait thief with moonbeams); tropes transformed (thief's moral dilemma); specific synthesis (coded flowers, captured starlight) feels inevitable; risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
