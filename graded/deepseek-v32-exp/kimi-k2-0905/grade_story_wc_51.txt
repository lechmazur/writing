<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "the silence itself grew heavy, pressing the air from her lungs"). Her final confession is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses and a visible cost in the blood drop and solidified light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens; the confession triggers a decisive change with cost (blood on wick, violet flame). Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the grotto's constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., bronze grotto's recursive reflections trap her, kerosene lamp sputters under pressure). Sensory details are purposeful and charge the final image (walls peeling back, starlight shaft).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; the grotto's resistance and lamp sputtering force her confession, with cost legible in the blood drop and valley settling. Dominant stake (valley's survival) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of burden and release emerges through particulars (confession, woven threads) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("surrender the heaviest stone") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "shingled hush rippled like a whale’s flank"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "calcifying the air into thin translucent sheets"), and propulsion supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, with specific synthesis (fractal weaving, personal guilt). Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
