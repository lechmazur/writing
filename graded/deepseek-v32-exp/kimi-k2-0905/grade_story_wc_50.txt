<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ansel's motivation is clear and rooted in his role; interiority is concrete through embodied actions like tracing the crack in the timer. His final choice to store wonder is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the tailored skin imagery. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly enacted in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Ansel stores wonder, restoring time with cost legible in "feeling the new seconds fit him like a tailored skin." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with echoes and reflections driving the pattern toward a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "veins of quartz" and echoes nesting in stone. Setting is integral to tactics and atmosphere, filtered through Ansel's POV with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing time) escalates through Ansel's agency under the accumulative lens, as he measures delays and reverse-engineers the timer. Cost is unmistakable when he stores wonder instead of using it, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus reason emerges organically from images like "translucent moths" for lost hours, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong in Ansel's noticing of reflections and echoes; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "jingling like distant cowbells," and propulsion remains clear through peak beats, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of harvesting echoes is highly original, transformed through specific details like percussion craters in metal. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with organic integration of elements.</comment>
