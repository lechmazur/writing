<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the weight of collective grief. The carver's change is earned through spectral mentorship and contemplation, foreclosing her initial path with visible cost. However, some impulses are more summarized than simultaneously acted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—the carver realizes grief is a transformation, not a stone to carve—with felt cost in her altered approach to memorials. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of butterflies and poems tightening meaning. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "glass panes rattled with thundering calm" and the greenhouse constraining choices by hosting key discoveries. The environment charges the final image through the oak tree and headstones, integrating seamlessly with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around understanding grief escalate through the carver's agency under the accumulative lens, as butterfly encounters and poem revelations deepen pressure. Cost is legible when she "finally allowing herself to feel the weight," but escalation relies more on pattern density than proactive choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as chrysalises wrapped in poems, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's shape. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature filtering through the carver's meditative nature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, though some lyrical density may slightly obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "wings beating in thundering calm" is purposeful and clear, even in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and spectral mentorship, transformed by specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
