<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calla's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices like stilling her heart and playing the lullaby backward revealing embodied emotion under pressure. Her final action of uprooting the seed is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration as the orchard transforms, costing its mechanical nature for beauty; the hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds strong, with the locust shell and music shaping tactics throughout. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the final image of the seed humming and statues rooting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge constrains choices, such as the swaying bridge affecting Calla's advance, and recurring objects like the locust shell charge the closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Calla's POV, with no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Calla's agency under the hybrid lens, from playing the violin to uprooting the seed, narrowing options and imposing cost as the orchard recalibrates. The dominant stake of reawakening beauty is tested through coherent pressure, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges through particulars like the locust shell molting and blossoms reversing gravity, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and implication, deepening the central question of beauty versus mechanism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Calla's poetic voice filters the world through rhythm and bias; purposeful compression, like the heart rhythm signaling, is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift undermines clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of violinist, enchanted orchard, and living statues, transformed through specific details like the locust shell map. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
