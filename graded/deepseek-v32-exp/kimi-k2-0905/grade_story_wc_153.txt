<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion (e.g., "pockets full of unsent letters"). The final choice to apologize is earned through the journey, with visible cost in the seeding of words and healing. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible in "the words did not echo; they seeded" and the healing cut. The gargoyle shard's evolution persistently constraints tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth and micro-settings like the gargoyle shard constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., "roots that breathed like lungs"). Setting mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology and reconciliation) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, culminating in the spoken apology with cost ("seeded"). The shard's use narrows options and deepens knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of apology and redemption emerges through images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the seeded words and transformed letters. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "mouth full of moonlit syllables"). Voice is poetic yet consistent, and any elision (e.g., time travel) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "gargoyle shard now glowing with pooled moon"). Clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and emotional arc feels inevitable. Risk-taking in non-linear time and lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., gargoyle shard) avoid template plots.</comment>
