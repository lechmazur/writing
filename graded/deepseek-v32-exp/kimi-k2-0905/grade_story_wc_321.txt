<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Arden's motivation is clear and rooted in resilient positivity, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His final decision to merge timelines is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the hourglass crumbles, demonstrating a credible endurance that forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a decisive change as timelines merge, cost legible in the hourglass's destruction and the saved possibilities. Causal lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early in the ferry setting, and the persistent constraint of the vanishing ferry shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like the phosphorescent barnacles and spectral grotto constrain Arden's choices and charge the final image of stitched skies. The environment pressures tactics through patterns and grotto closure, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Arden's agency, using the hourglass and radio to navigate patterns, with cost evident in the loss of the hourglass but gain of a coherent future. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, narrowing options through his steering choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience and possibility emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the saved possibilities. Subtext operates in gestures like the hourglass caps carrying weight, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision in time anomalies is taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense without artifacts; sentences vary rhythmically, advancing story with clarity and momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no loops or scaffold issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously integrated, with specific synthesis of parallel timelines and emotional truth. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
