<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart shaped like a foxglove") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses of duty and personal regret, with visible cost as she hollows into a "translucent silhouette."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing: Lira's sacrifice reconfigures preservation's cost, felt in her weightless state and the bamboo tube's final note. Under the accumulative/textural lens, imagery and emotional density cohere, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the chandelier's demand shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the opal library's drawers of emotions supply resources, and the chandelier's bulbs dictate Lira's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "twilight, a colorless breath"), with spatial choreography clear in the spiral climb and mezzanine walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, as each memory sacrifice tightens pressure and narrows options. The cost is legible on-page as she hollows out, and the dominant stake of preserving names deepens through her sequential losses, foreclosing her own existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and memory emerges through particulars like the bamboo tube and Lira's regrets, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the child inheriting her song, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost on the value of preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("echoing like a dropped pearl") and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "Por" as footnote) is taught and pays off in closure, reinforcing the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "like silk scarves pulled through needle eyes"), and syntax varies naturally to support emotional beats, with no obscurity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of a museum of extinct feelings with personal sacrifice, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure and bold imagery (e.g., "foxglove regret") heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
