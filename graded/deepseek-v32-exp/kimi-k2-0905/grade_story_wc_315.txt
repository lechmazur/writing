<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative; the final choice to transfer the buckle is earned through prior causality and visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as she relinquishes the buckle, with felt cost; the hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds throughout, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (e.g., arbor height limits movement) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the parachute buckle acting as a micro-setting that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, from spotting the glider to descending and transferring the buckle; cost is legible in the "heavier by one choice" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust and release emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the buckle transfer, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., radio static) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats, such as the "soundless echo" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of self-confrontation and revised vigilance feels fresh and specific; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
