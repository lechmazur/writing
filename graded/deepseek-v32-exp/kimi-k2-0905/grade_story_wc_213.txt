<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's credibly curious nature is embodied through specific actions like logging data and switching the toggle, with internal conflict evident in her decision to prioritize listening. Her father's backstory anchors her motives without over-explanation, and the final choice to leave the toggle is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her realization about courtesy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara understands the mountain's message, reinforced by the bell's tolls mapping microclimate data. Causal drive holds strong from her curiosity to the switch, with orientation clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in the after-ring and her humbled quiet, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting constrains choices through pressure dips and the bell rope's tug, charging the final image with the bell's resonance. Sensory details like "clouds surged like slow whales" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. The barometer and rope function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from the barometer drop to the rope's tug, forcing her switch. The dominant stake—understanding the mountain—tightens with each microclimate event, and cost is unmistakable in the bell's sonic map and collapsed gust post-toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically through Mara's actions and the bell's resonance, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the conceptual repricing of tracking as courtesy, reweighting prior particulars like the siren's pitch shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Mara's technical observations and poetic rhythm under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as the solstice hush thickening, and elision (e.g., the father's death) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "moon that looked nailed to the sky" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story momentum seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of microclimate science and mythic elements like "the sky's throat," transforming the listener trope through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
