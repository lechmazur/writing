<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (e.g., sundial base pulsing against ribs). Final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in emotional hollows filled. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as exile gravity tugging her back.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—faith returns as breath, filling exile hollows—under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens. Structure is coherent with clear orientation early; causality links steps from entering orchard to rebuilding prayer house. Persistent constraint of interrupted journeys shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory detail (fossilized petals, myrrh-scented air) filtering through POV. The catacomb orchard constrains choices and charges the final image, as roots move to point toward the prayer house site. Spatial choreography is clear, and details evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith escalates through protagonist agency—exploring, aligning sundial, uncovering mirrors—under the hybrid lens. Cost is legible in the effort to rebuild and the emotional journey. One meaningful tightening occurs when the root-road forms, forcing a decisive act with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like whispering the hymn. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—faith rebuilt through wandering among bones—without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from particulars, such as the sundial base confirming time's memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature (e.g., noticing skeletons with wedding beads). Rhythmic control under pressure, and elision (e.g., interrupted journeys) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the caretaker's question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "shadow stretched across the ruins"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with fresh elements like catacomb orchard and sundial base transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (e.g., brass mirrors fracturing reflection) create authenticity and non-obvious angles.</comment>
