<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's colorblind desperation and Rosa's rough-voiced practicality are embodied through specific actions and micro-choices, such as his trembling hands and her hidden smile. Their final joint decision to smash creations and plant the reed arises from earned realizations about broken beauty, with visible cost in the shattered glass. Interior contradictions are shown in scene, like Milo's initial search for impossible hues yielding to acceptance of violent color.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, building through pattern exchanges (plant arrangements, bartered objects) to a conceptual repricing closure where smashing glass communicates "we are most alive where we are broken." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the "spiral that communicated their shared awakening." The reed and marble eye persist as constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored in the glassblower's courtyard with purposeful sensory detail (soot, fogged goggles, molten sand). The concertina reed and marble eye function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the closure, as seen when the reed is planted and "veined with hairline fractures." Sensory selection reflects professional priorities, like Rosa's breath of molten sand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding beauty in imperfection escalates under accumulative lens through density increases in the plant-arrangement dialogue and Milo's vision shift. Agency drives escalation, as when Milo guides Rosa's glassblowing after his awakening, culminating in the deliberate smashing with cost visible in "each shard arranged." One meaningful tightening occurs when the marble eye reveals fractured colors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the reed's transformation and smashed glass, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "colored rain on distant colorblind painters" and the concept that "we trade our wounds not to heal them but to teach them new languages." Subtext operates in gestures like Rosa's hidden smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic signature, blending Milo's perceptual bias ("colorless world") and Rosa's tactile language ("rust and heat"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the way broken things sing louder." Purposeful elision in their non-verbal plant communication is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "the violence of it, the way broken things sing louder." Sentence propulsion accelerates with climactic beats, and clarity is maintained even in peak moments like the marble eye revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of colorblindness, bartered objects, and imperfection, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed by specific lived detail, such as the reed warping into a "delicate silver curl."</comment>
