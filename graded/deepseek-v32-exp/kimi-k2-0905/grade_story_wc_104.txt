<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is vividly embodied and drives strategic choices; her patient resilience feels earned and culminates in a decisive act with visible cost, such as scattering seeds with reverence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost via the seed planting, and the persistent constraint of the vault shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The carnival setting is richly specific and actively shapes choices, like using netting to trap guards; the arrow and soil charge the closure with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under causal lens, with cost legible in the imminent wall collapse and her strategic waltz to impede guards without violence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from concrete actions; the final image reweights prior struggles without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer through seeds and arrow flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistently poetic and character-filtered, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "cellophane flashed in the dark" is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of carnival decay with seed vault resilience feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, as in the decoding chord.</comment>
