<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied, with her curiosity and isolation driving micro-choices under pressure; her final agency in reading the phrases earns the decisive change with visible cost in the crew's acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to closure; orientation is immediate, and the ending lands with a decisive change (lights restored, isolation lifted) and felt cost anchored in Lira's shaken knees and the shared horizon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the hopscotch board and airship's dimming lamps pressure Lira's actions; sensory details like "brass ribs creaking" and "moonlight fell through grates" are filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under the causal lens from personal isolation to ship survival; Lira's agency in translating patterns drives the climax, with cost legible in the crew's emergent unity and her new authority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of language and connection emerges organically through particulars like the phrasebook and starlings; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "shared light" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical rhythm ("creaking like an old librarian"); perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., hopscotch patterns) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("pooled like spilled ink") enhances clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes steampunk and linguistic magic with originality; the concept of stories powering light feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
