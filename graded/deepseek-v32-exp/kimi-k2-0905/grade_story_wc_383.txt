<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from skeptic to haunted follower. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as the seashell's resonance "vibrating through her bones." The final choice to archive the memory is earned by prior causality, with visible cost (color blindness) scaling to the length. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like her professional doubt versus personal yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost (color blindness and independence) under a causal lens that holds. The seashell's instructions drive because/therefore linkages to the garden and memory retrieval. Orientation is clear within 120 words ("velvet garden at twilight," "Mara," "seashell"). Cost is legible in "each syllable she sang cost a corresponding color from her vision."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "indigo hedges, their leaves soft as funeral clothes" filtered through Mara's POV. The pond and foxglove tunnel mirror internal states and evolve causally. Micro-setting (seashell) alters tactics, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from following the shell to humming the lullaby, narrowing options and incurring cost. Dominant stake (reclaiming memory) tightens through meaningful turns, with visible price in color loss. Pressure coheres until the final act reweights independence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, such as the garden becoming a "public archive," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and isolation. Subtext operates in gestures like the mother's hummed lullaby. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through "memory, once set free, prefers to live in plural."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "the garden responded: petals unfolded backwards." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose like "independence ringing through her like a struck bell." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "trespassing inside a bruise." No artifacts obscure causality; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes (skeptic, memory loss) through specific, grounded choices like resonant keys and quarantined memories. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric prose heightening stakes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
