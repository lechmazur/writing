<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost bride and boy exhibit profound interiority and contradictory impulses, such as "lovingly venomous" presence and the boy's shift from fear to "mournful elation." Their motivations are consistently rooted in the debt, compelling higher-stakes choices like the fruit-picking climax. The final renunciation and forgiveness are earned through prior causality with visible cost, such as the bead's integration and the greenhouse's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable cost: the ghost's physical return and scattering, and the boy's freedom with the seed. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, reinforced by the bead's pulse escalating visits. Orientation is immediate, with the greenhouse and ghost established in the opening lines, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse functions as a crucible that constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "copper pipes exhaled slow steam" and "fruit of molten silver." The setting pressures the climax, as the trees wither after yielding the fruit that repays the debt. Micro-setting elements like the stone bead and lantern are woven into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, from the ghost's visitations to the boy's active acceptance of the fruit-picking. The dominant stake of debt repayment tightens through the bead's accelerating pulse and the orchard's ripening. Cost is legible in the boy's lifted guilt and the greenhouse's dissolution, foreclosing paths with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bead and orchard, culminating in a non-literal answer: "debts can become gifts." Subtext operates through imagery, such as the seed as new life, without moralizing. The final image of the boy planting the seed reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV shifts between ghost and boy are clean and section-break clear, with distinct perceptual signatures like the ghost's spectral drift and the boy's "black as the sky" eyes. Voice is consistently poetic and controlled under pressure, e.g., "broken bells" dialogue. Any elision (e.g., the debt's origin) is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences like "atoms of ash becoming moths" advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no register drift or muddle in peak beats. Propulsion is maintained through concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes ghost lore and alchemical elements into a non-obvious, inevitable narrative, with risk-taking in its lyric density and hybrid structure. Tropes like the vengeful spirit are transformed through specific choices, such as the debt becoming a gift. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
