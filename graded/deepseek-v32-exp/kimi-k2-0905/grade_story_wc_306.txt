<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final offer to the geologist is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost as certainty is unhooked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and symbolic objects to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Cost is legible in the image of "certainty unhooked and flapping like a loose sail," with orientation clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting and objects (lighthouse, hollow mirror shard, wind chimes) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of moral certainty vs. truth escalates through Mira's agency in deciphering wind chimes and offering a choice. Cost is unmistakable in the researchers' embrace of "protected vulnerability," narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through particulars like the wind chimes' messages and the hollow mirror, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of "the larger, more honest world of maybe."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., wind chime cipher) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the brass bell's message.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of conscience-for-hire is fresh and synthesized with specific details (wind chime cipher, hollow mirror). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
