<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caldera's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in rational rebellion and preservation of truth. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "abrasive calm" and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the cog as a stylus. The final public speech is earned by prior causality, showing a credible shift from internal revolt to external action with visible cost in the crowd's hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Caldera's public words and internal mental shift reconfigure the narrative's stakes. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with her actions leading logically to the climax. Cost is legible in the "sedimentary layers inside her own mind shift."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "smelled of the plague years" and "marble domes jut from the tide." The sunken city and sewer environment pressure choices, constraining Caldera's exploration and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the cog and sedimentary layers are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus denial escalates through Caldera's agency, from internal agonizing to public declaration. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with her discoveries, leading to a decisive action with cost in the crowd's recoil. The tightening forecloses options and reweights the narrative without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and denial emerges organically through events and images, such as the cog and layered narratives. Subtext operates in implication, like the chronometer's "ghost heartbeat." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Time is a gear that eats its own teeth," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic, philosophical tone that reflects Caldera's POV. Diction and syntax are consistent, e.g., "abrasive calm" and "sedimentary layers." No head-hopping; perceptual signature is sharp, and elision is purposeful, teaching the pattern early and paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks. Clarity remains, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic themes with fresh angles, like the philosopher in sewers and chronometer cog as symbol. Specific details feel inevitable, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and transformation resist cliché.</comment>
