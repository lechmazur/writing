<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict between private grief and public duty is shown through concrete actions, such as pocketing the label then tearing it. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she releases the scraps onto the water. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies undermine the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration—Marisol's shift from expunging to preserving memory. Cost is legible in the image of torn label flakes drifting on dark water. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (ridgeway, lounge, ridgeway) is taught early and pays off. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the resurfacing town forces Marisol's descent and discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "ankle-deep silt" and "twilight that clung like damp gauze." The ridgeway and submerged lounge act as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with the photograph trail deepening stakes from personal scandal to shared loss. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marisol realizes the photos "expunge" her father's choices, leading to her decisive act. Cost is felt in her "private grief" and red-rimmed eyes. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the resurfacing town and photographs reconfigure meaning from private pain to collective memory. Subtext operates powerfully in the father's note and Marisol's tearing of the label. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, through the image of a "living text." No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical yet precise prose like "metallic sigh" and "mirrored hush." Voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., the father's backstory) is anchored in present cues and pays off. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and vivid, such as "wind chime above the levee office door gave one last metallic sigh." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with discovery. No register drift or mixed metaphors in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of resurfacing town and personal memory, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative premise or template plots.</comment>
