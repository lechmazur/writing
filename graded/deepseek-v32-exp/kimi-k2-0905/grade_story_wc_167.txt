<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with interiority shown through specific perceptions like "pupils dilating" and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to find value in the mundane drives the narrative, and the final act of throwing the prism is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the prism's dissolution. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her private craft versus her trade, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through patterned imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara's action revalues the mundane. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure lands with cost as the prism heals windows, reconfiguring meaning. The persistent constraint of the prism shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "salt wind" and "kelp and rust," and the micro-setting of the prism and water rings constrains Mara's choices and charges the final image. The environment actively guides her communion, with spatial choreography coherent and details integrated into action, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating mundane value is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency in reading the rings and throwing the prism, under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the prism's loss and the healing of windows, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices, with palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars like the teacup and scar, with subtext in the rings and Mara's spoken words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the healing light. Earned wisdom arises from specific struggles, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., the ring sequences) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and the read-aloud test passes smoothly, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis of glazier trade and spiritual reckoning, transforming tropes through specific details. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Bold choices in structure and imagery support coherence and closure.</comment>
