<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity and micro-choices under pressure are vividly embodied, such as her past actions with joy coupons, and her final stance with the officer reveals a credible endurance. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing. The closure choice to plant the stems is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the planted stems and shared whittling reconfiguring meaning. Cost is legible in the soil darkening "as if remembering rain." The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting elements like the turbines and dried flowers constrain choices and charge the final image, with the turbines' groan affecting action. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the "scent of nothing important," filtered through the performer's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, such as the crow's interaction and the officer joining, tightening the stake of cultivating lightness. Cost is visible in the petal fragments tearing away. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the escalation could be slightly sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, not statement, with the final planting offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief and silence. Subtext operates in gestures like the crow's gift. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the "lightness possible, though not guaranteed" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, such as the description of the bouquet as "the color of apologies." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic variation. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the narration's evolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language, like "every heartbeat feel like vandalism," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, though minor overwriting exists in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dystopian and personal elements with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices like the whittling as rebellion. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final image feels inevitable and fresh, with emotional authenticity.</comment>
