<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., uncovering fragments for the girl) revealing his kindness and methodical nature. The final choice to become visible is earned by prior causality, with cost legible when he closes his eyes in relief. Interior contradiction (hiding vs. helping) acts in scene, and the relationship with the girl forces a meaningful change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elias becomes visible and the girl whispers "I see you," reconfiguring their connection with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and voice fragments. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the fragments shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the library and pipe chases constraining choices (e.g., Elias crawling past sections) and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "cold metal," "sapphire hush") are filtered through POV, and micro-setting (fragments) alters tactics. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving voices and becoming visible) escalates under Accumulative lens through Elias's agency in uncovering fragments, driven by the girl's need. Cost is legible when he risks exposure but gains connection, narrowing options. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges through particulars (fragments, voices) without moralizing, with subtext in gestures (girl's palm on floorboards). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "lanterns" metaphor and joined voices, reweighting prior material. Epiphanies are earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "crawled on elbows worn smooth"). Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in the girl's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "constellation of voices") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Rhythm supports scene needs without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, transforming tropes through specific details (crawl space dweller, voice fragments). Emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet ending heighten stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
