<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilay's motivation is clear and fierce, driving all actions; interiority is concrete through paint-stained hands and resin scars, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the grove joins the music and Ilay walks away, cost felt in the broken silence; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern buildup; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the alder grove and statue constraining choices and charging the final image; details like moss brightening to jade are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from start—restoring music in silence—escalation driven by Ilay's agency in strumming the insulator, leading to grove response; cost is legible in the new anthem stored and renewed conversation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and restoration emerges organically through images and actions, not statement; ending offers a non-literal answer with the grove's joined music, avoiding moralizing and resonating deeply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with poetic, perceptual signature; voice controls rhythm under pressure, and elision (e.g., "seventeen silent years") is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "cracks like ivy" enhances clarity, though minor overwriting risk exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic restoration with tree-song sculptor concept; specific details like porcelain insulators and empathy in motion feel inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes.</comment>
