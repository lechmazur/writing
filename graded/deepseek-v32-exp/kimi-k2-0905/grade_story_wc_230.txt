<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., deciding to drink the mixture not to erase but to carry others). Final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional weight of bearing others' emotions. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the desire to occlude versus the fear of quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with on-page cost in the protagonist's decision to "carry them more gently." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of emotional density increasing. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of the ravine inside.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the hanging orchard and storms pressuring choices (e.g., roots like nooses, storms forcing action). The environment constrains the final image, and sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "storm-green" sky and truffles that remember unspoken farewells.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from preparing the cure to the luminous film revelation. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional exposure and decision to bear others. Dominant stake (muting vs. bearing emotions) tightens meaningfully with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the glass eye and truffles, offering a resonant non-literal answer to psychological safety. Subtext operates in gestures like "occlude" and the final drink. No moralizing; complexity embraces bearing pain without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, with purposeful compression (e.g., "fruits knocked together like teeth confessing"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and enhances meaning, e.g., "roots relaxed their nooses." No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of empathy virus, truffle foraging, and relic use, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices.</comment>
