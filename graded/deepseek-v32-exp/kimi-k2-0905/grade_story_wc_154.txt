<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing contradictory impulses. The final renunciation and shared birthday are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sternum ache reconfiguring outward. The boy's shrewd innocence constrains actions, and emotional progression avoids diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the sediment shift and lighter coral. Accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and decryption. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of shared guilt shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final star image and checkpoint carry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the atrium and banana leaves filtering through POV bias. The coral fragment constrains choice and charges the final image where plaster seems to grow from sea. Sensory details like droplets as syllables are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal guilt escalates through protagonist's agency in decrypting notes, leading to a deepening that reweights options. Under accumulative lens, density increases with each decoded symbol, and cost is legible in the ache opening outward. No coincidence resolves; closure forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coral and cast glyphs, with subtext in gestures like the boy's tap. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sediment shift and dew-held petals, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, syntax reflecting morphine-softened edges. Dialogue in coastal dialect feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "quiet percussion of peace," and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language like "anesthetic hummed like distant shelling" is consistent and purposeful, no loops or artifacts. Closure image is clear, with propulsion maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of war trauma and healing through specific details like brain coral and cast glyphs feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. Transformation test passes; premise is fresh and fully committed.</comment>
