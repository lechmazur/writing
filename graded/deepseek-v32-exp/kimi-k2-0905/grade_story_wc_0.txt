<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her scientific curiosity and personal grief, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "kindled humility." Her final realization that change is gradual is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as Mara reweights her perspective on change, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The ending image of "decay, like growth, is a courtesy" charges the closure with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse constrains choices (e.g., working in ruin) and charges the final image with decay. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "humidity still clung like a guilty conscience" and "rotting orchids and galvanized steel," enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in collecting and analyzing dust, leading to convergence. Cost is legible in her changed outlook, foreclosing her frantic grief. Stakes around gradual change tighten meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change vs. catastrophe emerges through particulars like butterfly scales and neutron star decay, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "drama is optional; change is not," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and lyrical diction. Voice remains coherent under pressure, e.g., "data unfurled across her visor." No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "miniature galaxy in decay," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and local change through specific details like butterfly dust and pulsar algorithms feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical-scientific blend heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
