<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is shown through actions like carving the needle, and the final acceptance of grief is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Mara welcomes grief, felt cost in "loud inside her silence." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of sensory details escalating to emotional release. Orientation is clear early; causality is tight, with the needle and drum shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (cedar, goatskin, frost) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The cavern and tools like the phonograph needle are integral to action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional numbness) escalates under accumulative lens through Mara's agency with the phonograph and drum. Cost is legible when grief arrives "loud inside her silence," foreclosing numbness. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and silence emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement, with subtext in gestures and reversed lullaby. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the drum's heartbeat, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Mara's deafness. Dialogue is minimal but effective in signed exchanges. Prose rhythm varies with emotional pressure, and any elision (e.g., backward songs) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "Vibrations traveled through the machine... like a shy knock." Rhythm and syntax support emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing deafness, backward songs, and grief in a non-obvious way. Risks with poetic language heighten stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story would not work unchanged; elements feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
