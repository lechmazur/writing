<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in scene. Final choice to redirect commissions is earned by the revelation of her complicity, with visible cost in the realization that her maps funded the cover-up.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing via the realization that reweights her understanding of past actions. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of her decision to chart consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the repair bay and green glass shard constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the shard guide navigation and mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering withheld truth escalates through protagonist's agency in navigating parallel worlds, leading to a tightening revelation. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight of realizing her role in the cover-up, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth and complicity emerges through concrete images and events, with subtext in the shard and data cube. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the note's wisdom, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic and sensory language. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., parallel universes) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats, without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universes feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the green glass shard. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
