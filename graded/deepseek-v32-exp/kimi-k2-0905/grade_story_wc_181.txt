<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Her final merger with the page is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in lost memories. The choice to stop pursuing fruit or embrace knowledge demonstrates contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: Mara merges with the page, reweighting nonlinear inheritance as love. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns tightening through imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the final image charges prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the orchard's telepathy dampening in the bathroom pod shapes tactics, and the astral environment mirrors internal states. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "petals that chimed like tuning forks," integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: plucking galaxy-fruits costs erased past pages, narrowing options. The dominant stake (knowledge vs. past) tightens with visible cost, and her choices foreclose paths with felt consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: nonlinear inheritance as "simply complicated love" and self-authorship resolves without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature reflecting Mara's bias. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early, e.g., the cameo's spiral, and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting exists in peak beats without muddling sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in non-obvious synthesis: nonlinear inheritance and astral orchard feel inevitable, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific details and emotional truth.</comment>
