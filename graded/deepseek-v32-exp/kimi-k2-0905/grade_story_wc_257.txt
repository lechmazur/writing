<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The transition from preservation to celebration is earned through specific actions, such as placing origami figures, with visible cost in her final decision to leave. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change as she leaves the observatory, with cost legible in her transformation. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building through motifs like origami and coordinates. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful tightening that forecloses her previous path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the observatory tracking souls and curtains of intention releasing lost hopes. Sensory details like candlelight and fabric are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image of paper constellations. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief versus acceptance escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with her actions of placing figures leading to a tightened decision. Cost is visible in her transformation, and the resolution is earned without coincidence. One meaningful deepening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief transforming into acceptance emerges organically through images like origami and coordinates, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final constellation, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control.
