<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to witness without judgment is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority like "felt her own edges soften." The final renunciation to become the swan is earned by prior causality (past attempt to save a chronicle), showcasing credible endurance with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—keeper becomes the swan, feeding silence. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive layers. Orientation is clear within 120 words (keeper, library, tonight). Cost is legible in "ink draining into the library’s roots," and persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the overgrown library constraining choices (e.g., shelves folding into wings) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "moss-laced parchment," "candlelight that never quite reached the floor"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing vs. interfering escalates under accumulative lens through density increases (e.g., path deepening, swan unfolding). Protagonist agency drives escalation—keeper's decision to become the swan forecloses options with cost (loss of self). Cost is unmistakable in "memories flatten, ink draining," and tension operates at sentence and story scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of witness and silence emerges organically through images and events (e.g., keeper's transformation, regenerative silence). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "To witness is to fold the world into a shape that holds no weight"). No thematic drift or simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "crumbling peace thick as dust motes"). Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., cryptic folds) is taught and pays off at closure. Diction remains within keeper's lexicon, and prose reflects her mind state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "pages fluttered like startled ravens"), with no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shelves rising like trees in fast-motion") but clarity maintained; no loops or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of library as living refuge and keeper's transformation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices (e.g., origami swan as guide). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision with no derivative echoes; bold commitment to premise.</comment>
