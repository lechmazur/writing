<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like using the echo chamber stone and reading ice patterns. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to release the stories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the stone cracking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the release of stories—under a causal lens, with felt cost in the cracked stone and healed caves. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages, such as the bloom of hush enabling the climax. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the harmonic caves and echo chamber stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like stalactites chiming at a breath. The environment pressures actions, such as the Great Resonance Dome affecting the energy beings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving stories escalates through protagonist agency, like creating the bloom of hush to confront the energy beings. Cost is legible in the cracked stone and released sigh. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence and memory emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like whispering "We were here." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the release of stories, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with Jalen's whispers. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm without artifacts or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "hammered repose." Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and closure is clear and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like energy beings and echo chambers feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet climax heightening stakes. Specific details transform tropes through grounded choices, and the final image recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
