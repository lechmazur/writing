<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's altruism is consistently embodied through her frost messages and actions, with interiority shown via selective perception under pressure. Kai's micro-choices, like brewing coffee, reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—her becoming the nebula—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the tether loosening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Mara blurs into the nebula, with cost legible in the "single note of release." Orientation is anchored early with twin suns and floating arches. The pattern of messages and community response tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—floating arches tilt, forcing harvest—and charges the final image as Mara becomes the violet haze. Sensory details (e.g., "dew froze into letters") are selective and POV-filtered. The orchard planet functions as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency under accumulative lens, from frost messages to collective harvesting, with cost visible in human chains and her counterweight role. The dominant stake of saving orchards tightens via coordinated effort, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective survival emerges through particulars like shared ladders and the watering bell's reprise, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "family is the crop we keep replanting," reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with multi-focalizer shifts at breaks (Mara to Kai), clean under Track C. Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("brambled hope") and rhythmic control. Elision in frost messages is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("clang like berries caught in wire") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, sci-fi, and collective action feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is transformed through specific world logic and character choices.</comment>
