<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is deeply rooted in her past and consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like rubbing the stone. Her final choice to lock her heartbeat away is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. The shadow unbound adds internal conflict, though it occasionally feels abstract, but does not undermine the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot coheres with a resonant reconfiguration at closure, where Mira becomes the dusk, sacrificing herself with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without contradiction, with the stone's metamorphosis serving as a pivotal turn that narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming library and river stone function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "orchid-walls exhaling evening perfume" being selective and purposeful. The environment mirrors internal states and evolves causally, supporting the theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as the stone's warming and metamorphosis deepen the stakes, leading to her decisive act with legible cost. The dominant stake of preserving hope tightens through a meaningful cadence shift, foreclosing paths with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stone's transformation and Mira's promise, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to hope and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates through images and implication, such as the shadow stitching timelines, embracing complexity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The poetic voice is consistent, and any elision is purposeful, such as the compressed video footage, taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "luminous regret" does not obscure clarity, and there are no significant loops or artifacts; propulsion remains strong through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious concept with emotional specificity, such as the dusk noticer and shareable dreams. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, demonstrating authentic vision.</comment>
