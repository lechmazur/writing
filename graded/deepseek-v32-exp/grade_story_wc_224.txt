<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is reported via summary rather than dramatized through conflicting desires in the moment. Emotional states are labeled ("sorrow," "grief") instead of embodied, and the protagonist lacks a distinct internal voice or contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on synopsis-style telling ("After weeks of effort") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. Closure is achieved through a thematic realization statement rather than a decisive action or image with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The setting is established with generic fantasy tropes ("forgotten books whispered") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain choice. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the summary rather than an active force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract and resolved through a montage of "nightly sessions" rather than a specific pressure-filled moment. The cost is described ("clarity that hurt") rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off or loss on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("home was wherever she chose to nurture connection"), replacing dramatic resonance with moralizing. This "thematic echo" flattens the subtext entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The voice is distant and expository, summarizing internal states rather than inhabiting the protagonist's perspective. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard fable-like narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on clichés ("mist in her mind," "bloomed like flowers," "threads in the tapestry"). Abstract nouns dilute the imagery, and the rhythm is repetitive and list-like.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "healing via magical object" arc is executed with standard tropes and no subversive twist. The concept of a mountain bookstore is interesting but treated as a generic container for the plot.</comment>
