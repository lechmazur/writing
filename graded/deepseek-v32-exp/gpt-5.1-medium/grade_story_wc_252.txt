<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses—barbed words yet gentle hands—and her final choice to embrace the whalebone's call is earned by prior causality of strain and grace. The cost of her renunciation is felt in the closure image. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mara's realization reweights freedom and true nature, with cost legible in "the harbor rise inside her like a held breath." Causal-Hybrid lens holds from inciting incident to climax; orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint of strain shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—harbor twilight, sublittoral fringe—and the whalebone scrimshaw as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of embracing true nature escalates through Mara's agency—deciding to join the pirate and listen to the whalebone—with cost unmistakable in the final beat. Under Hybrid lens, pressure tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of freedom through self-acceptance emerges organically from images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the whale's "awaiting song." Subtext operates in gestures like the pirate's half-rebuke baptism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet grounded—and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; elision (e.g., "listening" not singing) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like surf breaking around a familiar rock") is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pirate mythology with psychological depth feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (e.g., scrimshaw's polished island) transform tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
