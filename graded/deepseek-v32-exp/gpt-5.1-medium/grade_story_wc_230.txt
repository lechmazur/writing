<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's involuntary truthfulness and motivation for psychological safety are consistently embodied and drive key choices; Risa's character adds depth with her heart-hearing ability, creating a crucible relationship that forces exposure and growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the glass eye is revealed as a mere mirror, reconfiguring empathy and fear with felt cost; hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds strong from early orientation through earned turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hanging orchard setting constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "cables bit into the rock" and storm descriptions are purposeful, filtering through POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist and Risa's collaborative work, tightening under hybrid lens; agency in tracing truffle networks and confronting the storm leads to a cost-legible reweighting of options at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and truth emerges organically through particulars like the glass eye's transformation; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "practicing seeing one another" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control; dialogue with Risa carries subtext and advances plot, and elision (e.g., dream sequences) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or artifacts; figurative language like "orchard groaned like a dreaming animal" coheres, and syntax varies naturally to support momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes empathy virus, truffle foraging, and relic with originality; risk-taking in hybrid structure and conceptual repricing feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
