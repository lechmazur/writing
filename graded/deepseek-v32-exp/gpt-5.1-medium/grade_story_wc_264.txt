<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to cultivate sparks and witness unchosen paths is clear and rooted in consistent traits of duty and endurance. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the clock in my chest keeps punching invisible tickets." Final renunciation (Earned Stasis) is earned with visible cost, foreclosing the path of giving up. Contradictory impulses act in scene through his persistence despite futility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the guard sings and the dune hums, reconfiguring his role with cost. Orientation is clear early with "after the last forest burns" and "I walk its ridges every night." Persistent constraint of buried tracks and frozen clock shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with "glowing dune in bloom" and bioluminescent sand constraining choices by dictating patrol routes and manifesting possibilities. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action. The dune and chess clock charge the final image, essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing vs. loneliness escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase—sparks brighten, other versions appear. Protagonist agency drives escalation via decisions to sing and persist, with cost legible in "stopping feels like erasing the dead." One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory, time, and possibilities emerges organically from images and events, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like winding the clock. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the guard's singing and the dune's response, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the guard's mind state. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "I am occasionally everywhere." Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence, especially in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic, bioluminescent dunes, and divergent archive with freshness and inevitability. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the chess clock and wave functions. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
