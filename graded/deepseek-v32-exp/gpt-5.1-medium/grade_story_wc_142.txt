<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jae's dual allegiance and internal conflict are vividly embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The foundation stone chip serves as a tangible anchor for emotion, though the closure choice remains in charged poise rather than a decisive change, slightly limiting full characterization arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from the Council's request to the encoded graffiti resistance, culminating in a charged poise closure where the serpent mural's question reconfigures options with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and structure coheres across shards without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft city setting is indispensable, constraining choices through its labyrinthine geography and charging the final image with the serpent mural. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "noise and neon tides," integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Jae's agency in feeding data to Lilo, leading to the Council's suspicion and the final question of flight or fight. Cost is legible in the "hopeful desperation" and the chip's burning, though the stakes tighten without a full reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance versus order emerges through particulars like the graffiti codes and dual allegiance, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal question that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Lilo's art and the chip's warnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending observational clarity with emotional urgency. Dialogue with Lilo is natural and goal-driven, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid imagery like "phosphorescent paint" and "slow, hungry sharks." Minor scaffold exists in repetitive "I thought/ I did" stems, but no artifacts harm closure or causality, and line-level craft maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of carnival raft city and graffiti-as-resistance, transforming tropes through specific world logic and moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
