<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "lucidly watchful."

Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing in the final image of the needle centering at "modest but undeniable ascent," reweighting hope with cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the gauge as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the "unlifted" futures grief, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "tide-polished grotto" and "bioluminescent algae," constraining choices through decoration arrangements and charging the final image. The grotto functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test by pressuring the protagonist's experiments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revitalizing hope escalates through protagonist's agency in testing patterns, with cost legible in the needle's reactions, such as sagging for "unlifted" futures. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each decoration adjustment, and the final choice forecloses options with visible cost, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope and ethics emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the gauge's readings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final ascent, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending logical and dreamy diction.

No head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues.
