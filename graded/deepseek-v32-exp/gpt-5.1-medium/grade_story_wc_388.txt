<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theo's motivation as a truth-seeker is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority under pressure (e.g., "felt the air tighten"). His final choice not to deliver the diamond is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (Theo's renunciation) with cost legible in the final sentence. Orientation is clear early, and the diamond's role as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., radioactive dust storms force respirator use). The orchard constrains the climax by hiding the diamond and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from verification to control of the diamond through Theo's agency; cost is unmistakable in his choice, which narrows options under the causal lens. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus control emerges through particulars like the reassembled letters and the diamond's imprint, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via Theo's choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct observational voice; elision in the letters is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (e.g., "luminous veils") serves atmosphere without muddle, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic investigation with engineered resilience in a fresh, inevitable way; the diamond as data key transforms tropes through specific cost and character choice.</comment>
