<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's pacifism and sound-collecting are deeply integrated with his actions, such as avoiding the diary clasp and his realization about empathy. His internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices like angling the microphone toward the journal, and the final unclasping is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his "shiver." No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through receding sounds to Elias's insight about Mira. Closure lands with cost as he unclasps the diary after the realization "rearrange his bones," a Decisive Change. Orientation is clear early with workshop and fireworks timeframe. Persistent constraint (diary) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the workshop's jars, microphones, and open roof framing choices. The diary as micro-setting constrains actions and charges the final image. Sensory details like "friction of pages" are POV-filtered and purposeful, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cataloging silence to understand empathy) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase in silence and the diary's staticky halo. Agency drives the turn to unclasp, with cost legible in the emotional shift. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges implicitly from Elias's cataloging and realization about "how the world pressed her," without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like avoiding then opening the diary. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unclasping action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature for Elias's sound-focused noticing. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, e.g., "expectant souls," and elision (e.g., diary backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, e.g., "shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones." No loops, scaffold, or overwriting; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Closure image is clear and uncompromised by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of collecting silences for empathy is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with specificity through tools like "polished ribs of umbrellas." Emotional truth avoids templates; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
