<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iren's serene anger and motivated pursuit of the time mystery are concretely embodied; his final choice to loosen selfhood is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (Iren's self-loosening); causal lens holds tightly from investigation to revelation; the ink constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and ink micro-setting constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Iren's agency under the causal lens, from tracking to ink experiment; cost is legible in his anger and acceptance, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time and perception emerges through ink and disappearance without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and elision (e.g., time cuts) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or figurative muddle; minor overwriting is purposeful and does not harm closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of time disappearance and ink is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning the within-band bonus.</comment>
