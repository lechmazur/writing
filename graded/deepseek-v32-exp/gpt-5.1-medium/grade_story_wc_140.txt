<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., studying death certificate "like a mirror"). Final choice to write a new certificate is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in acceptance of unfinished state. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as layering others' memories over his missing name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the new certificate, leaving name blank, with cost legible in "he let the next story begin." Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of erased histories shapes tactics. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "sound traveled strangely" and "diesel hum" filtering through POV. The container labyrinth and tides constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (poison label) recurs with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase (layering stories) and agency-driven choices like buying the label and writing the certificate. Cost is unmistakable in the final renunciation of old story. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of identity and erased histories emerges organically from images and events, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through the blank name on the certificate. Subtext operates in implication, such as the poison label emblemizing disappeared facts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "filters reality differently"). Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., forgotten past) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "containers looked like frozen waves"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere; clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of identity and bureaucracy through specific details like the poison label and port setting. Tropes are transformed with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Turns feel earned; emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
