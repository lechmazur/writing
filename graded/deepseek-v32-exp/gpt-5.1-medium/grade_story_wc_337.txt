<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilan's motivation to ground restless spirits is clear and rooted in his backstory, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His hesitation at the final knot shows internal conflict, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality. The cost is visible in the settled spirits and reconfigured silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as spirits settle and silence gains meaning. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the net's unraveling provides coherent escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight setting is vivid and sensory, filtering through Ilan's POV to constrain choices like unraveling the net. The environment charges the final image with the interlaced hush, and details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes to ground restless spirits escalate through Ilan's agency in unraveling knots, under the accumulative lens. Each knot release deepens pressure, and the cost is felt in the spirits' settlement. The final knot forces a trade-off with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and silence emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the needle drinking unsaid thoughts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting silence with meaning, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Ilan, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision like "accumulates silence" is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "light bent into patient planes" is coherent and purposeful. Information density is high, advancing story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of mask restorer unraveling knots to restore a name is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing elements with specificity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
