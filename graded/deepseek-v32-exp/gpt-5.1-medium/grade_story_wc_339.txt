<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "familiar tightening in my chest"). Final choice to compromise is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("felt like mourning"), and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("compromise that felt like mourning"); accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, reinforced by pattern of images. Orientation is clear early, and closure unit reweights premise without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail (e.g., "hull split open like a cracked ribcage"); setting constrains choice and charges final image through the library and snow globes. Micro-setting (snow globes) actively shapes protagonist's decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) escalates under accumulative lens via discovery of experiment; agency-driven choice at closure narrows options with legible cost. Pressure coheres through density increase in imagery and concept.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (e.g., snow globes as metaphors for memory); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the physicist's experiment mirroring protagonist's quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is sophisticated and consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "time was folding over") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent figurative language; prose has natural rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is sharp and unambiguous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sunken library and memory experiment; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
