<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation rooted in guilt is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., hands shaking; final choice to play the voicemail is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change (playing the voicemail quiets the firmware) and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "dusted vinyl and rain caught in microphones"; the lab and amber object constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens; the firmware's crying forces a key choice that narrows options with cost legible in the voicemail playback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and memory emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the voicemail, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "time folds in on itself"; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "meteors hush the sky," without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, blending haunted firmware with personal grief; specific synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
