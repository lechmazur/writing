<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like pressing the orris root and murmuring apologies. His final choice to leave the shard and move the bed is earned by prior experiments, demonstrating contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost of integration is felt in his realization that the house notices him, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns of observation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending lands with cost as Eli believes the house's attempts to say "I am still here." The orris root as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and closure is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with sensory details like the rust stain mirroring the coastline and the corner refusing sunlight. The environment constrains choices, such as Eli moving the bed toward the dense corner, and charges the final image. Micro-setting elements like the orris root deepen stakes, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through Eli's rituals and the dropped shard incident, driven by his agency. The cadence shift when he leaves the shard reweights options with visible cost in his altered stance. Protagonist choices narrow possibilities, and cost is legible in the dream examination and realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutual perception emerges through particulars like the orris root and displaced objects, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the house's breathing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Eli's belief. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggles, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "gulls tracing lazy sigils" and "hushed blaze." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control under pressure is maintained. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is preserved in peak beats like the storm scene. Syntax supports emotional beats without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of a "creeping normality noticer" with a living house, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the orris root and displaced objects transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
