<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to learn repair is clear and rooted in embodied nostalgia; micro-choices with gears reveal values under pressure. Final repair actions earn credibility through prior causality with visible cost in emotional toll. Minor abstraction in "lunar-eclipse locksmith" title doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with pattern-building via prophecies and mirror repairs; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (library thawing) with cost in "driftwood nostalgia." Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the final image of thawing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen library setting constrains choices (frost, mirrors) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action. Micro-setting (gears) functions as environment altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of repair escalates through prophecy scraps and mirror repairs, driven by protagonist agency; cost is legible in emotional and physical effort. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair emerges through images and events, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via library thawing. Subtext in gestures like "unfinished sentences" deepens complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV has distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and poetic, with elision (e.g., prophecy fragments) taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting accumulative pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes repair, memory, and regret with fresh, non-obvious angle; specific details (gears, mirrors) feel organic. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
