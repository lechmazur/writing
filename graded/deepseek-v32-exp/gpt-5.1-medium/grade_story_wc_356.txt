<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling hands during the proposal). Her final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality and flaws (restlessness), with visible cost in the elders' surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the village's inhaled listening. Orientation is clear early, and causality is driven by Liora's actions, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated through sensory details (scents, ropes) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The treetop village pressures tactics and mirrors internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening stakes through her proposal to plant the seed. Cost is felt in the risk of death blooming, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (seed, grandmother's wisdom) without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in silence and imagery, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory focus) and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts harming closure. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, passing the read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of herbalist lore and treetop society, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. The corpse flower seed transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
