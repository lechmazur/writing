<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariel's eccentricity is embodied through methodical actions like diagramming on receipts, and her final realization that stories live in human attention is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the shift from complex geometry to simple observation. Contradictory impulses (e.g., sanely eccentric with catalog numbers) act in scene, and micro-choices under pressure (following the poet) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of "a posture of attention," reconfiguring the premise that stories originate in human receptivity. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned details (hyperbolic diagrams, star-marked pauses) to a resonant reconfiguration, and the library's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The library setting constrains choice through its geodesic shelves and unremarkable junctions, charging the final image where the air "folds inward." Sensory details (fluorescent quiet, floral carpet whispers) are selective and POV-filtered, integrating with action to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mariel's agency under the accumulative lens, as her star-marked paths and following the poet deepen the stake of finding story origins, with cost unmistakable in the collapse of hyperbolic maps into "a single depth." The dominant stake (locating story beginnings) tightens through her observations, foreclosing earlier methods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars—hyperbolic geometry, patron pauses—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that stories live in "a posture of attention," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery (scarf as comet tail, folded air) and avoids abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mariel, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing "words rising like steam") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., hyperbolic geometry mechanics) is taught early and pays off at closure, and diction remains within her lexicon without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax (e.g., "dusk bled into violet"), with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the closure image without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes library science, hyperbolic geometry, and story origins into a non-obvious, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (neutron haiku, tensor calculus) anchor universals, and the transformation of the eccentric librarian trope feels fresh.</comment>
