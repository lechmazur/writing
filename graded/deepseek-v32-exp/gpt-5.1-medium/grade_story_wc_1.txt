<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in recovery, with embodied interiority ("stars trembled like glass"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the ledger symbol, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation to walk forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns (frost, ledger) building to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as the protagonist walks toward the pass, foreclosing the past with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the canyon and ledger constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, such as "frost climb the glass," mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering purpose and attacker) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, like matching frost patterns to ledger. Cost is legible in the decision to remake the future, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (glass, cold, fire) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the walk, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic diction ("drifting resonance") is consistent and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating with scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artist, ledger, and canyon feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes. Specific details transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
