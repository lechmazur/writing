<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits as an arcane linguist, driving her to higher-stakes choices like negotiating with the clerk. Her interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "inkstained fingers"), and her final choice to write in the book is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost. The attribute "carefully resourceful" is demonstrated through micro-choices under pressure, such as charting gaps and offering work, foreclosing paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, from the time traveler's disturbance to Lysa's mapping and closure. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on-page as a decisive change where she writes in the book, reconfiguring options with cost. The map of gaps acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and the cost is legible in the conditional exit and added rescue mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "phosphorescent indexes" and "colder, narrower corridors" that reflect Lysa's POV and urgency. The labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices by forcing navigation through gaps and charges the final image in the library chamber. Economy of detail balances atmosphere with momentum, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving her brother) is signaled early and escalates through Lysa's agency under the causal lens, such as renegotiating entry and descending into gaps. Pressure tightens meaningfully with each choice, narrowing options and incurring cost (conditional exit). The climax involves a visible price where her writing alters the timeline, demonstrating earned escalation driven by protagonist action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the library of unlearned lessons and rescue missions, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the clerk's warning and Lysa's marginal writing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to regret and memory. The final image reweights prior material by adding a rescue mission, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction like "unheard symphony" and rhythm that modulates with pressure. Dialogue with the clerk is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in negotiations. Purposeful compression (e.g., the botanical diary's annotations) is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language (e.g., "vein-structure of a leaf") is coherent and purposeful. Rhythm supports propulsion, and sentence-level craft advances story without redundancy. Read-aloud test passes with clarity, even in peak beats like the final writing scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (magical bookstore, time travel) with fresh, non-obvious angles like the library of unlearned lessons and botanical diary map. Specific details (e.g., "Fern That Remembers Missed Apologies") create irreplaceability, and risk-taking in structure (e.g., mapping absences) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity.</comment>
