<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rafi's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as bracing against the coral when overwhelmed. His motivation to sandpaper memories drives key turns, and the final choice to use remorse in the stew is earned with visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost in the soldiers' softened reactions and Rafi's exhaustion, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible on-page, satisfying the 9+ quick test with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress and coral pavilion constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "wet stone and cumin" filtered through Rafi's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as the tidal pools guiding his descent, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Rafi's agency under the accumulative lens, as he tastes shards and decides which to incorporate, with cost legible in the garrison's unusual hush. The dominant stake of managing memories tightens meaningfully, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the tidal pools and sandpapered memories, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory's transformation, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "adobe ribs darkened and sighing." No loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats; closure image remains sharp and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting and stored remorse with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight.
