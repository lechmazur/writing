<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelio's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his craft, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his studious nature drives the narrative without stock phrasing, and his final endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) under an accumulative lens; cost is legible in the final image of the town rearranging memories, and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the fluorescent lamp and bonsai forests constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Aurelio's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aurelio's agency under an accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable as he aches and the silence persists; one meaningful tightening occurs when he gathers textures to potentially make the town speak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in silence and invention; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and supports closure, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with risk-taking that heightens stakes; the synthesis of invented histories and lamp hum feels inevitable, and emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
