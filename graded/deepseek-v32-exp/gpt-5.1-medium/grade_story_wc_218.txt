<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "brazen calm" while tracing tide lines) and micro-choices (sketching, wiring) that reveal values. Final endurance (death) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (death amid negotiated peace), cost is legible, and accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and persistent time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (e.g., "pillars like frozen moonlight"), with the orchard and pillars constraining choices (e.g., wiring experiments) and charging the final image of interspecies negotiation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of fostering interspecies respect escalate through protagonist's agency (e.g., copper wire networks), with cost legible at closure under accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs as discoveries unlock secrets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of communication between nature and stone emerges naturally from events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through "everything negotiated peace" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic (e.g., "clock chiming underwater"), with stable POV, rhythmic control, and perceptual signature that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with no artifacts, varied syntax, and high information density (e.g., "copper wire wrapped around oak branches" advancing plot). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes elements organically, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative design and fresh angle on mortality. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
