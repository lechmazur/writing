<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (grief and gratitude twine) acting in scene. Her motivation to nurture wonder intensifies under pressure, and the final realization is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the memory opening instead of lancing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the eclipse where Mara's emotional shift occurs on-page with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with a decisive change in perception that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (pine, sage, eclipse viewers) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The courtyard and ash tree pressure the shared moment, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing wonder escalates through Mara's agency in adapting music and interactions during the eclipse, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the emotional reconfiguration, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through particulars (e.g., hair curl, eclipse) without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mara's mind under pressure. No head-hopping, and purposeful elision (e.g., memory cues) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats like the eclipse moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eclipse and personal memory feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., adaptive playlists) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
