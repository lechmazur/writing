<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corren's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that earn his shift to acceptance. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final renunciation has visible cost in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page, under an Accumulative lens that holds. The mosaic stone and glass eyes create coherent causality, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern orchard constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. Stalactite drips and bare branches pressure tactics, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering the protagonist's approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Corren's agency under the Accumulative lens, shifting from retrieval to acceptance with legible cost. The dominant stake (ambiguous loss) tightens meaningfully through his failed conjuring attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars like the glass eyes and mosaic, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and images, deepening the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the conjuring sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of emotional mathematics and magical realism, with risk-taking in structure and theme. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes with specific detail.</comment>
