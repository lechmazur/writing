<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Milo's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as palming the zodiac coin and using the key, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in Ramos's thoughtful walk, under a Hybrid lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds through Milo's prepared actions driving the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like the maze's creaks and storm's aurora, but micro-elements like the key are slightly underutilized in spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the Hybrid lens, with the challenge tightening stakes and cost legible in the port's potential shutdown, though the resolution relies slightly on pre-established groundwork.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of whispers vs. shouts emerges organically through action and image, with a resonant non-literal answer in the ending, avoiding moralizing but leaning on a familiar concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Milo's attention to sound and detail, but dialogue is limited and voice convergence occurs in minor moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control without major artifacts, though minor overwriting appears in phrases like "geomagnetic alerts flashed crimson," slightly affecting peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of unique elements like the key and maze, with risk-taking in the whisper method that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
