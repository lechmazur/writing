<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Micro-choices like rerouting power and compressing fears reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final burn decision is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the rose losses and shifted nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: the controlled burn reduces static and reconfigures the android's nostalgia, foreclosing the path of unmanaged fears. The Hybrid lens holds, with causal linkages (static → burn plan → execution) and textural depth, and orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "hot minerals and faint resin" filtering through the android's POV. The glass-domed enclosure and desert roses pressure choices (e.g., roses responding to drought) and charge the final image of the burn, constraining tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving inner static) escalates under the Hybrid lens via the android's agency: he plans and executes the controlled burn, narrowing options and incurring cost (rose damage). The tightening is driven by his choices, with legible price in the aftermath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: containment over erasure, survival through sacrifice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "repaired ceramic" and miniaturized fears, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects the android's consciousness. Purposeful elision (e.g., fear compression) is taught and paid off, and diction remains consistent under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like repaired ceramic") is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates through the burn sequence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (android, childhood fears) with fresh specificity—controlled burn as mental survival—feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and details are irreplaceable (e.g., magnetic north shifts).</comment>
