<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maro's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion like "ache worn thin and expectantly resigned." His motivation to "listen to how it might yet change" intensifies under pressure, compelling his teaching choices. The final chord is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the students' gradual vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as Charged Poise—the tentative chord reconfigures stakes with cost legible in the "small tremor of breath" and silences. Orientation is clear within 120 words; mosaic structure (weekly rehearsals) is taught early and lands coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (velvet library, zither) charges the final image and constrains choices, e.g., the rosette "denote[s] the circle" and appears in the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "music lingered there like breath between pages."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony amid division) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases in rehearsals, driven by Maro's agency. Cost is legible in shrinking distances between chairs and "voices cracked on certain names."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning hatred emerges through particulars like the zither's "interlocking hands" and the final chord, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, e.g., "no one sang; they waited until the tremor passed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maro, with distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic prose like "traveled stillness." Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "silence held, fraught yet oddly gentle," and elision (e.g., weekly jumps) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "sound was far from perfect, but it was not a slogan; it was a question." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of music and social division feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure. Specific details like the zither's rosette and character backstories avoid tropes, and the final image recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
