<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in her defunct revolutionary status, with embodied emotions like "the sorrow that had long calcified in her chest" and micro-choices under pressure, such as agreeing to the excavation to reimagine civilization. Her internal contradiction is shown when she questions if the revolution failed due to lack of imagination, and her final choice to cover mirrors for a new purpose is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with clear orientation early, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mara covers mirrors to preserve reimagined futures, with cost legible in the final sentence. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints like the Council's opposition shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the baroque asteroid's mirrors that pool time and the sealed chambers where discoveries occur. The environment charges the final image, with sensory details like "time thickened around her fingertips" filtered through Mara's POV, ensuring purposeful integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under a hybrid lens through protagonist agency, as Mara and Elyas's excavation and poetic recordings force a stakes-deepening dispute with the Council. Cost is unmistakable in the Council's sealing order and Mara's solitary walk, narrowing options and reweighting possibilities with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as the shift from revolutionary failure to reimagined futures, with subtext in gestures like covering mirrors. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of preserved possibilities, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in Mara's POV, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "time hung in curtains thicker than breath." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision (e.g., the Hourglass myth) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, as in the climactic description of Mara's walk. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no artifacts obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of visible time, archaeological dispute, and reimagined futures, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
