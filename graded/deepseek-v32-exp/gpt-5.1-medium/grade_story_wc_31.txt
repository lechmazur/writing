<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and drives key choices; his internal conflict between hiding behind truth and making vows is embodied in scene, and his final vow is earned with visible cost, such as the "deep green ringing" against his ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens; closure is a decisive change with legible cost when Elias vows and sees sound colors, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the sunken ship library constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details like "silt floated like slow, forgiving snow" are POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elias's internal conflict; escalation is driven by his agency under the accumulative lens, from retrieving the key to making a vow, with cost legible in his transformed perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, such as luminous vows representing forgotten promises; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as Elias integrates sound and color.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "meteor hush" and "breathing sea," with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "cold closing over him like glass," and syntax varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of elements like the lamplighter and vow library; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation pays off with inevitability, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
