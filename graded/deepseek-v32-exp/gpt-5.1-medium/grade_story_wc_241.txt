<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction between probability as safety and her father's risk is embodied in micro-choices like avoiding the hospital. Final note exchange earns reconfiguration through prior causality, with cost visible in "a little sad, clover bright." No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of notes and probability deepening stakes. Closure is a conceptual repricing via the exchanged notes, reweighting their relationship with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words; transitions between library, subway, and hospital are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Settings like the "rainwashed library" and subway with "smeared comets" are vivid and pressure choices, e.g., the library as refuge constrains her delay. Sensory details (wet wool, crushed clover) are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling probability with personal risk escalates under accumulative lens through discovered note and subway scrawls. Protagonist's agency in writing back narrows options with cost legible in father's reaction. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "lucid contradictions" emerges from particulars like the note and subway messages, not statement. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through the exchanged notes, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (probability professor's lexicon). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven in hospital scene. Elision (e.g., brother's texts) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "smelled of wet wool, printer ink, and something sweetly green"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure. Read-aloud ear test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability, gambling, and familial conflict feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and note motif heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure transforms familiar material.</comment>
