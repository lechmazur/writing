<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., wiping palms on apron). Final choice to include unquantifiable costs is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the potential loss of the atrium's stories. Micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the cracked mullion, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of measuring light before change. Orientation is clear early; structure from dawn to decision coheres with one meaningful tightening. Persistent constraint of the atrium's fragility shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (mist, glass, pond) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The atrium constrains action and mirrors the shore, integrating into the protagonist's perception. No generic elements; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving intangible value vs. progress escalates under Accumulative lens through Kade's pressure and the protagonist's realization. Agency in the decision to include unquantifiable costs narrows options with visible cost. No coincidence; tension operates at multiple scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of valuing beauty in the mundane emerges through events and images, not statement; subtext in gestures like tracing the mullion. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of agreement between water and glass. No moralizing; earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and reflective, consistent under pressure. Dialogue with Kade is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "glass, too, is only sand convinced to stand still"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs; clarity and concision maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes through specific details and voice; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel earned from character choice; no derivative premise. Specificity anchors universals, as in the atrium's reflection of the town.</comment>
