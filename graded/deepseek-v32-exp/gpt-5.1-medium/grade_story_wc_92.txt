<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her calm inventiveness is embodied in actions like appraising the fort as an engine, and the final choice to activate the rods is earned by prior causality. However, minor lack of interior contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the locks forgetting inside/outside—under a causal lens, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, supported by tight because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the luminous fort and blackout constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the bottled daylight tubes tracing shadows on the sundial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewriting the fort's story—is signaled early and escalates through Iri's agency during the blackout. The cost is felt in the locks' reconfiguration, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through events and subtext, like the coded sundial message, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the locks' reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic and mechanical tones. Dialogue with Trann carries subtext and advances plot, and elision is purposeful without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor density in peak beats slightly limits clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details like the lock sentinel and silent revolution transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
