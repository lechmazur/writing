<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The final choice to nudge toward repair is earned by prior causality, such as the geode's hum and the vortex over the village, showing a credible change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the nudge toward repair reconfigures the mission. Hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds, with orientation anchored early and causality tight from geode to vortex. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating observatory and geode crystal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from discovering the vortex to rerouting processing power. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off between ruin and repair, tightening stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trauma and redemption emerges through particulars like the geode and vortex, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of personal trauma and systemic control, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes, with inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
