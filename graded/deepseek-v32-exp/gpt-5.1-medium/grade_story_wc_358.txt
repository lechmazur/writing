<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in professional duty; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as thumbing the patch as habit. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final recommendation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the realization about wind patterns reweights the premise with cost, evident in the final paragraph's call for protocol changes. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of wind shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the container labyrinth constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like wind patterns and silence are filtered through POV, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from initial survey to discovering wind's role; cost is legible in the need for redesign, and stakes tighten meaningfully with one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of foresight and convergence emerges through particulars like the patch and wind patterns, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., wind patterns) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "frozen waves" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of accident investigation with wind dynamics; risk-taking in style heightens stakes, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight with specific, grounded choices.</comment>
