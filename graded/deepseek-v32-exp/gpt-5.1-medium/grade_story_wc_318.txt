<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His "mourfully eager" trait drives actions like using leaf blowers, and the final realization of ongoing work is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a resonant reconfiguration as laughter is restored and Lysander understands his work is unfinished, with felt cost in the "uncertain chuckles." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The egg timer's shiver provides cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the echo chamber tunnel constraining choices by amplifying sound. Sensory details like "mildew from the ceiling" are POV-filtered, and recurring objects like the egg timer charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring laughter is signaled early and escalates through Lysander's agency with the leaf blowers, leading to a meaningful tightening as laughter emerges. Cost is legible in the parents' emotional release. Under accumulative lens, density increases effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tending to unspoken grief emerges through events and imagery, like the half-jokes blooming as laughter. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision is taught and paid off. Prose reflects Lysander's mind, and dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "voice cracking, fusing with the engines." No loops or scaffold issues; clarity and momentum are maintained. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept is original, synthesizing grief and unconventional sound therapy through specific details. Tropes are transformed, and risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
