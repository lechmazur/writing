<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lady Sera's motivation to understand healing through absences is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through specific actions like listening behind walls. The traveler's final realization is earned by their shared walk, foreclosing his initial task with cost felt in carrying her presence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her withdrawal not as refusal but experiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "I carried her presence like a lantern"; the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and dialogue. The orientation is anchored early with harbor cliffs and garden, and the constraint of the thread shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shadowed garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like "fountains dry, bronze nymphs crusted with leaves" filtered through POV. Environment pressures the walk where revelations occur, supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as the traveler's decision to walk with Lady Sera deepens the stake from commission to shared excursion, with cost in the redefined obituary. One meaningful tightening occurs through their conversation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence and healing emerges through particulars like the carpet thread and garden paths, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the map of absences. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "absence becomes an ache sharp enough to name." Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision like the thread's symbolism is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "like a line on a map meant for ghosts" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of obituaries for the living is fresh and transformed through specific lived detail, with risk-taking in quiet narrative heightening stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable, as the thread and absences integrate organically.</comment>
