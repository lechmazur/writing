<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrator's religious skepticism is embodied and consistent, driving micro-choices like appraising the rosary beads with "practiced chill." Evan's guilt and desperation are clear, and the narrator's internal shift at closure is earned through prior causality, though the rebalancing feels slightly rapid. No major flaws touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong from confession to tunnel exploration; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the "small rebalancing" where truth finds rest. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens remains coherent without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the tunnel's "mineral cold" and valve wheel with rosary beads shape tactics and atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's skepticism, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding truth) escalates through protagonist agency, narrowing options via discoveries like the valve wheel and phantom footfalls. Cost is visible in the narrator's internal shift, foreclosing pure skepticism under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of swallowed truth emerges through particulars like the ghost shift and rosary beads, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "rebalancing" image, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature ("religiously skeptical") with stable distance and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and any elision (e.g., radio psychics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("tunnel breathes") is coherent and purpose-driven, and peak beats maintain clarity with no register drift or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost shift concept through specific, grounded details like the valve wheel and radio psychics. Risk-taking in blending realism with ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
