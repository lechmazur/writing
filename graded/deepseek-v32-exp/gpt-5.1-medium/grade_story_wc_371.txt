<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in tracing the bread's pattern. His motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" drives key choices, and the final sharing of bread is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the adjustment of posture. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "slight adjustment in his posture" and warmth rising "defiantly." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear by ~120 words. Persistent constraint of the bread shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "cracked tiles veined with moss and mint" filtering through Elias's POV. The overgrown courtyard and tea house constrain choices and charge the final image, holding silence "as carefully as it holds the rain."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict about change escalates under accumulative lens through dialogue with the tea mistress, leading to the shared bread dissolution. Protagonist agency in bringing and sharing the bread narrows options with cost legible in the crumb dissolving "into amber."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in the ordinary emerges through images and events, not direct statement, with subtext in dialogue like "Absolution is not on the menu." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the shared warmth rising, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "braided into the cold air like a question." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes through specific details like guerrilla gardening and the bread's symbolism. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
