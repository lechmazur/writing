<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses, such as "fierce tenderness rising in her, sharp enough to cut yet careful not to pierce." Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, earning the final insight through prior causality. The client's collapsed face and unsent letters add secondary pressure without overshadowing her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the vision reveals "I was afraid," reconfiguring understanding with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly from journey to revelation, and orientation is anchored early. The gargoyle shard's pulse and the spirit interaction create coherent, motivated linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image, with phosphorescent algae and roots like ribs shaping Lysa's path. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The setting operates as a micro-setting that alters tactics, such as the condensation windows enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lysa's agency under the causal lens, from evoking spirits to the vision rewind. The cost is legible in the swallowed consonants and the brother's clenched silence. The dominant stake of finding the truth tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like unspoken apologies and the rainspout shard, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "I was afraid," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in silences and erased words, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Lysa's world. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the spirits' song tightened until it was almost a scream." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the vision sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language, such as "breathing green wounds," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the vision rewind without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cryptic medium, mangrove spirits, and a gargoyle shard feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details, like the shard veined with salt, avoid template plots and create authenticity.</comment>
