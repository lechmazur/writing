<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with interiority conveyed through embodied emotion (e.g., "ache behind my ribs"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as pruning trajectories to prevent cruelty, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—questioning whether tending the garden breaks old equations—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through patterns of light and memory. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in the final lines: "my exile will have been more than a sentimental calculation." Orientation is clear early, and the lens coherence ensures no ambiguity, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., pruning trajectories to alter orbits) and charging the final image with the nebula garden's "falling petals." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's bias. The environment actively pressures tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as glimpses of "familiar constellations" force stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the narrator's doubt: "whether I am merely extending them into a quieter register." One meaningful tightening occurs when the sonar pings feel "heavier," narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—light versus burning, generational patterns—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "teaching each newborn sun that shining is not the same as burning." Subtext operates in implication and gesture, avoiding abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("petals of ionized dust fell in slow spirals"). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., "forgotten transit") is taught and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control and diction remain consistent, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting occurs in mid-beats (e.g., "fields of ion fire arranging themselves into flowers"). Closure remains clear, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic caretaking with sentimentalism in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the calculating gear. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity make the story feel inevitable and fresh.</comment>
