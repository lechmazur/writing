<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation to uncover truth is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "breath a torn cloth." Her final choice to catalog wounds is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her fear of contamination versus desire to be scorched by the past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot coheres under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens, with the diary discovery inciting action and closure landing as a Charged Poise—Maris's whispered parley reconfigures her role with cost ("the diary was heavier"). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the obsidian lagoon and floating library constraining choices—Maris descends to the shore, and the lagoon's darkness charges the final image. Sensory details like "moonlight could not pierce its surface" reflect POV bias and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on uncovering truth, escalating through Maris's agency as she engages with the diary and debris messages. Cost is legible in the diary's weight and her commitment to catalog wounds, narrowing options under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the debris messages "KNEEL" and "WITNESS," offering a non-literal answer to truth and resistance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, with earned resonance from concrete actions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "pages fluttering without wind," and propulsion remains clear through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of floating library, encrypted diary, and retrocognition, transforming tropes through specific details.
