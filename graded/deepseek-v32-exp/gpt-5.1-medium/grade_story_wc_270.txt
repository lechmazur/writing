<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Teta Lila is consistently characterized with clear motives, and the narrator's telepathy adds depth, but the narrator's internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses in scene. The relationship serves as a crucible, driving choices, and the final unsealing is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the council's disappointment and the springs' new futures; causal lens holds tightly from discovery to unsealing. Orientation is anchored early, and the embryo's implanted destiny shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with sensory details like "steam ladders" and "sulfur pools" filtering through the narrator's perception. The hot springs constrain choice and charge the final image, evolving consistently with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of freedom vs. control escalate through the embryo's discovery, decoding, and council confrontation, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is visible in the lost opportunity for order, tightening options under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition with intent emerges through events and images, like the unsealing reweighting destiny, without moralizing. The final image of springs dreaming futures offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "leaf-thoughts were slow, like dripping resin." Telepathy colors perception, and dialogue is natural but sparse; no head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no artifacts; figurative language like "ghost ribs" enhances clarity without muddle. Information advances story consistently, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy, implanted destiny, and post-volcanic setting feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the kite script. Risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
