<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses—vulnerability and proactive resolve—shown through micro-choices like kneeling in damp soil. Her motivation to graft new meaning is consistent and intensifies under pressure, earning the closure choice with visible cost. Eli's guarded posture adds secondary pressure without flattening her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Charged Poise where Mara's shared silence with Eli reconfigures her isolation with felt cost ("slightly less alone"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the moss garden pattern teaches early, paying off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the data center's transformation into a moss garden constrains choices (e.g., moss as stepping stones) and charges the final image. Sensory details like "honeyed hush" and glowing moss are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: Mara's agency drives the deepening from passive recognition to active planting, narrowing her emotional options. Cost is legible in her "honest ache" and loosened chest pain, though the stake tightening is subtle rather than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growing through scars emerges organically via the moss metaphor and pendant's recurrence, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "small green futures," reweighting prior wounds without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's perceptual signature evident in phrases like "skinned and thin as old wiring." Dialogue is natural and subtextual ("You came"); prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "abandoned vines" coheres. Minor register drift in "protected vulnerability" feels slightly analytical, but clarity and momentum remain high, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tech decay and organic renewal feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet accumulative structure. The moss garden and pendant transform familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
