<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., reading the swan by touch). Final decision to step onto the path is earned by prior causality and reconfigures his duty with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost as the library surfaces. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of his duty shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., swan transforms room, library charges final image). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with environment constraining actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing vs. participating) escalates through protagonist agency under accumulative lens. Cost is legible when he steps onto the path, foregoing neutrality and altering the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with a non-literal answer at the end that reweights prior material. Subtext in the swan and path avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Synthesis feels inevitable, and emotional truth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
