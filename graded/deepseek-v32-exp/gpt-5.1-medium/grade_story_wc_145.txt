<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's dry-witted interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., the "subtly confident twitch" before redrawing) revealing values. Final choice to sketch the revision is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of official maps with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotional embodiment is strong in moments like the silence worrying him more than any storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from falcon's return to discovery, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change (sketching the revision) that reconfigures understanding of rivers' beginnings, with cost legible in the "quiet trouble it would bring." No outline-like sequencing; every beat advances knowledge or options through protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (iced lake limits movement, condensation guides discovery) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "beads of condensation began sketching their own map"). Rusted outpost and frozen lake pressure tactics throughout, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where rivers begin) escalates through protagonist's agency under causal lens, from message deciphering to condensation-guided discovery. Cost is visible in the revision act and heralded trouble, narrowing options away from official atlas. One meaningful tightening suffices, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings and truth versus official maps emerges organically through images (condensation map, phrasebook scrap) and closure's conceptual repricing. No moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the sketching act. Subtext operates in implication, such as the "worrying tranquility" mirroring internal tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (dry wit, professional bias in noticing maps and silence). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision (e.g., forgotten writing) is taught and paid off. No dialogue, but narration's rhythm and lexicon are consistently character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere (e.g., "the lake was a single sheet of iron"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; syntax varies purposefully. Read-aloud test passes with elegance, and closure image is undimmed by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of map-making and discovery tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in quiet climax with lyrical resonance; elements feel organic, not checklist-driven. Transformation test: story would fail with different particulars, and closure reweights prior material inevitably.</comment>
