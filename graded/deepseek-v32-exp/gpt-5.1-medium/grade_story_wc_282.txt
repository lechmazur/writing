<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like holding the fossil revealing character. The final choice to speak to the unknown is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfiguration of their role. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Iri speaks for two worlds, with cost legible in the spiral tightening and floating moment. The Accumulative drive lens holds, building through sensory layers. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the pool scene altering Iri's tactics. Sensory details like "cold brine" and "mineral tang" are purposeful and filtered through POV. The cave environment charges the final image, with spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Iri's agency under the Accumulative lens, from discovering the fossil to encountering the spiral pattern. Cost is legible in the final moment of speaking to the unknown. Stakes are dominant and tighten through density increase, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the elm leaf fossil and Iri's role, offering a non-literal answer to connection and memory. Subtext operates in gestures and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in sensory observations. Voice is lyrical and consistent, though minor ornamentation occurs. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts muddying peak beats. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax supports propulsion. Clarity is maintained even in dense descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of emotion mapping and post-human exploration, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the bone glass lantern transform familiar tropes.</comment>
