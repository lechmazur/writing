<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Potter's zen-mindedness is consistently embodied through unhurried care and concrete interiority; his motivation to understand change drives key turns, and his final choice to place clay and seeds is earned through timeline revelations, showing micro-choices under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost felt in "fragile yet enduring" knowledge, and the structure builds coherence through patterned revelations without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the oasis and lantern glass constrain tactics and charge the final image where sprouts lean phototropically, integrating sensory detail with POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under accumulative lens through fractured timelines; potter's agency in placing clay and seeds narrows options with legible cost, deepening the dominant stake of resilience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of kindness impacting resilience emerges organically from timeline contrasts; ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of sprouts and porcelain-like knowledge, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice reflects potter's mindset through controlled syntax and rhythmic variation, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language like "fractured timelines" enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of desert potter, timelines, and kindness feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and details are irreplaceable.</comment>
