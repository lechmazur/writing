<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Daniel's motivation to "plant forests of second thoughts" is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving his choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like hearing "unspoken words" and micro-choices such as cradling a leaf. Milo adds secondary pressure, and Daniel's final endurance as a "humble rebellion" earns closure with visible cost in the vote change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the council vote shifts and "unspoken words were softer." Causality is tight, from the magnetic grotto discovery to synchronized displays, leading to a decisive change. Cost is legible in the "collective second thought taking root" and the altered future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Settings like the "cobalt library in mist" and "magnetic grotto" are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices by pooling unspoken words and enabling the rebellion. Sensory details (e.g., "rustled like dry leaves") reflect POV bias, and the library charges the final image with the pawn and grove display.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the woods) escalates through Daniel's agency, from hearing fears to organizing window displays that force a "sudden awareness." Cost is felt in the council members changing votes "without quite knowing why," demonstrating a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through images like "forests of second thoughts" and the synchronized displays, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "unspoken words softer now, leaflike," reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Daniel, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "unspoken words clinging to abandoned lockers"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., hearing words before lips move) is taught and pays off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no artifacts or loops. Figurative language (e.g., "forests made of hesitations") is coherent and purposeful, and sentences advance momentum without scaffold, as in the climax where displays "knit together into a vast forest."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "humble rebellion" through synchronized window displays is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet activism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the "magnetic grotto" transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
