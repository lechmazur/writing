<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilen's motivation to tend sculpted hush is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His synesthesia enables key actions, and the final release of the note is earned by prior causality. The fear that wonder might fade adds depth, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as the note is unleashed, affirming wonder. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to the climax. Orientation is clear early, and the chisel strike triggers a coherent turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Ilen's POV. The amber music sheet and ice bells function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and description is purposefully woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) escalates through anticipation under the Accumulative lens, culminating in Ilen's agency to release the note. Cost is legible in the captured hush and storm of colors. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shared breath between sculptor and bell ringer. Subtext operates in silence and color, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, reflecting Ilen's synesthesia. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing synesthesia, silence, and art into an organic whole. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere.</comment>
