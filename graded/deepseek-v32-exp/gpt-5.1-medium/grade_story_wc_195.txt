<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calder's internal conflict is concretely embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the marionette program and rejecting the masks. His motivation shifts credibly from duty to personal choice, earned by prior causality with visible cost in his renunciation of service. Mira's mystical presence applies secondary pressure without flattening Calder's agency. The final choice to "stay but not serve" is a credible endurance foreclosing his old path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through imagery and dialogue to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Calder's allegiance is reconfigured with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the marionette theater program early signal pays off in the final unsnapping of strings. The closure lands on-page with Calder's decision, charging the orchard's role as a crucible for unpredictability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with metal trees and glowing fruit shaping Calder's tactics. Sensory details like "glass veins breathing frost" and "branches that chimed" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Calder's POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent during the entrance and mask scene, reinforcing the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation deepens through Calder's agency in dialogue with Mira and the mask vision, forcing a stance crystallization with cost legible in his "rust beneath his skin." The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully, foreclosing his duty-bound path. However, the midpoint beat with masks slightly abstracts pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the marionette program and orchard, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of freedom and duty without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mira's dialogue ("you no longer know who pulls your strings") and the final image of unsnapped strings. The ending reweights prior material through Calder's choice, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, syntax modulating under pressure (e.g., "feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as in Mira's measured revelations. Purposeful elision in Calder's reflection is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "its glass veins breathing frost" doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in a few descriptive lines prevents a higher score, but no loops or scaffold obscure closure. Figurative language remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical orchard and marionette theater feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure's conceptual repricing arises from established patterns. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in Calder's "choreography" realization.</comment>
