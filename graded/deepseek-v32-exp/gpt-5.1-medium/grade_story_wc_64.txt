<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gardener's interiority is concrete and contradictory, embodied in micro-choices like climbing the silo despite shaking hands. His realization that he is the dead man from the tapestry is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing his blithe persona to embrace his role in easing unfinished intentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where the final image of graves awaiting decisions reweights the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early, and the tapestry's revelation drives a decisive change rooted in established patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory details like "cracked glass" and "cold wind" filtered through the gardener's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as the ladder climb and thread matching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the gardener's agency under the accumulative lens, from listening to murmurs to decoding the tapestry, with cost legible in his realization that he must "cut threads, not plant wreaths." The stake in understanding echoes tightens meaningfully through his actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's imagery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and closure without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the concrete realization that the dead need decisions, not flowers, earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the gardener's professional bias. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, as in "the silo hummed like a throat clearing itself," and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds, advancing story through poetic yet clear lines like "threads nestled into their missing places." Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cemetery folklore with tapestry decoding in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, as the silo and sovereign case transform familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
