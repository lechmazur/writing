<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kerran's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices; interiority is embodied through memories of drowning and campaign failure, with micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is somewhat abstract, lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, though the final realization of impact is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages; closure is a decisive change (community survival) with felt cost (bell cracking, arches lost). Orientation is clear early; the nebula resolves conflict but is foreshadowed, minor convenience doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (arches dictate routes, bell signals messages); sensory details (mineral-ghosted glass, violet gas) are purposeful and charged in the final image of shattered bell and drifting groves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (survival) escalate through quakes and planetary shedding; agency is driven by ghost's messages leading to collective action, with cost legible in lost arches and broken bell. One meaningful tightening occurs as the nebula forms, forcing reexamination of plans.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope emerges organically from events and images (chalk messages, broken bell); subtext in "brambled hope" ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person ghost POV is stable and distinct, with poetic perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (chalk messages) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Figurative language ("luminous bruise," "discarded vertebrae") is coherent and enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost narrator, orchard planet, and nebula freshly; turns feel earned through character choice, and emotional specificity avoids templates. Risk-taking in perspective heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
