<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with interior contradictions (protected vulnerability) driving micro-choices under pressure. Her wistful pragmatism roots actions like saving cracked teacups and creating the light constellation, earning the final commitment to "make small, improbable safeties." The closure choice is motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in her whispered promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, building through imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's act redefines vulnerability as guard. Closure lands with cost in her promise and the scattering light affecting neighbors. Orientation is immediate, and the father's legacy persistently shapes tactics without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fire escape garden functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details (harbor masts, alley throat) filtered through Mara's POV. The environment pressures her realization and the constellation's creation, integrating setting into action and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, moving from passive grief to active creation, with cost legible in her foreclosed path and commitment. The dominant stake (internal conflict between vulnerability and safety) tightens meaningfully through her decision to "reflect light," supported by the quivering hush motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (bitting gauge tooth, reflective constellation) without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to safety and legacy. Subtext operates in gestures like hanging the tooth, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity in Mara's "foolish and fiercely tender" stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "masts write faint calligraphy"), and voice modulates lyrically under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., father's backstory) is anchored in present cues and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("alley's throat") is coherent and purposeful, and momentum accelerates toward closure without obscuring cause/effect in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of lockmaster lore and urban gardening, transforming grief tropes with specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
