<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Noel's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "felt his balance tilt every time he looked at it"). His final choice to write the song is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his isolation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his resistance to the woman's request before yielding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Noel writes the song, reconfiguring his relationship to the past with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with dust motes and pigeon routes deepening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single shard transition is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., attic dust dictates pigeon routes). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the skylight and trunk charging the final image. The environment constrains tactics and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increase, as the woman's arrival deepens Noel's internal conflict. Protagonist agency drives the peak choice (writing the song), with cost legible in the emotional trade-off. Stakes are signaled early and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (e.g., pigeons as carriers of lost songs), with subtext in gestures like the woman pointing to the meteorite. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to trust and memory without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "chords whose notes had slipped out of human frequency"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., dust mapping) is taught and paid off. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of grief and memory, with specific details (e.g., melody as topographical maps) feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible and transformative.</comment>
