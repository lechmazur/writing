<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is deeply rooted in his father's legacy, with clear interiority and embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, such as listening to the tower's groans and kneeling at the door, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final decision to "grow one strong enough to open stone" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the effort and risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing through the discovery of the library, reweighting the premise of truth and stories with undeniable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final realization about unfinished tales.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "rust, wet stone" and the "confessional lattice." The environment pressures the narrator's actions, and the recurring object of the lattice is integral to discovery and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the narrator's agency in listening and exploring, under the accumulative lens. The stake of freedom tightens through the discovery of the library, with cost felt in the impending discovery of bodies. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth, inheritance, and stories emerges organically through events and images, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the library of unfinished paths, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the father's story) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Lines like "the lighthouse is not only a prison; it is a throat clogged with tales" do multiple jobs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the boy who cried wolf myth with a prison-library concept. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the "confessional lattice" make it inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
