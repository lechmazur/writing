<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to offer a new bargain is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the vision of his daughter. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as remorse versus stubborn urge, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from breach of contract to feral orchard and new bargain. Closure is achieved through a conceptual repricing (deciduous vows) with felt cost in the fallen petals and vision. Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details that integrate into action, such as the orchard breathing a "green hush" and branches plunging through windows. The environment constrains choices, like using the bag contents to reach branches, and charges the final image with the watchful trunk and shimmering apple.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging generational wisdom escalates through the mender's agency, leading to a climax where he prunes and offers a new bargain. Cost is legible in the vision showing his daughter's possible future and the fallen petals, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows versus ironclad contracts emerges through events and images without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures like tying the ribbon, and earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet grounded diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Internal voice remains coherent, and purposeful elision (e.g., the vision as possibility) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and purposeful, such as "risk could grow like moss," and sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of magical realism with themes of contracts and generational wisdom, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the concept of deciduous vows heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the quartz-eye mender's unique perspective adds specificity.</comment>
