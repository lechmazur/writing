<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like carrying the telegram as evidence; healing is earned through causal events, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from dreams to discovery; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in "I finally witnessed my own healing"; orientation is anchored early and persists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and functionally pressures choices, such as the observatory dome and variable stars constraining the mapping; sensory details like "paper smelled faintly of summer" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens from personal dreams to shared historical burdens; protagonist's agency in mapping drives a meaningful tightening, with cost legible in the emotional realization of healing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the discovery of the temple as a ledger; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of witnessing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; dialogue with Aria carries subtext and advances plot; perceptual signature is consistent, e.g., "sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative with high information density; sentences multi-task without loops or scaffold, e.g., "the clocks surrendered to midnight" uses rhythmic control; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dream chronicling and celestial mapping in a non-obvious way; specific details like the daylily-pressed telegram enhance originality; emotional truth in shared burdens feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
