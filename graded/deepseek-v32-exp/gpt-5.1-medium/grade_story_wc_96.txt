<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's molting personalities and splintered hope are embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as shrugging on the weary archivist when patrol arrives. Relationship with Lio serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their state. Final renunciation of the archivist persona is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the shaking fingers and floorboard moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with closure as Charged Poise—the patrol retreat and reopening toward light reconfigure options with felt cost. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraints like the coffee tin and library shape tactics. Cost is legible in Lio's shaking fingers and the floorboard that "swell[s] slightly as if breathing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the rusted library under stars constraining choices (e.g., hiding the tin) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, such as "ink-stained fingers" and "drip of rain through the open roof." Micro-setting (coffee tin) alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resistance through words escalates under accumulative lens via patrol intrusion, narrowing options and forcing stance crystallization. Agency in shedding the archivist persona forecloses a path with cost. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance and identity emerges through particulars like the coffee tin and molting, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "reopen[ing] the fracture toward light," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., Lio's ledger of former selves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, fractured syntax reflects the narrator's state. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "splintered hope" to "weary archivist") without head-hopping. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "luminous fracture walking") does not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of penny poet, resistance, and post-prison library feels inevitable, with specific details like the coffee tin and molting trait. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
