<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotion (e.g., "tremor of certainty"). His final choice to speak and stride freely is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of silence with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in Lio's step down and the quartz's response. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, structure coheres in a single scene with clear orientation early. The ending reconfigures options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the quartz colonnade responds to footsteps and speech, charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Lio's POV, with the atrium and frozen lake mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic freedom) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Lio's agency in speaking, building a hesitant chord that deepens pressure. Cost is legible in the final image of him striding freely, with the quartz's hum affirming the shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of art vs. repression emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the dust swirling "like an audience." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lio's speech and the reconfiguration of boundaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "lantern-moth hush"). Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., past memories) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats like the final dais scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of art repression and environmental resonance, with specific details like the cloud-shadow poet and quartz colonnade. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
