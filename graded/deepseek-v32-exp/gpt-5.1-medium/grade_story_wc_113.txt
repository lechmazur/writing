<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Final acceptance of the score is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the musician's acceptance of the ghost's rebellion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks reweighting stakes. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (flooded setting) shape tactics. Cost is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV bias. The flooded opera house constrains choices (e.g., wading) and charges the final image. Micro-setting (opera program) evolves meaningfully, integrating into action and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from exploration to decoding the score, with cost legible in the acceptance of rebellion. Dominant stake (unraveling the code) tightens through density increase, foreclosing options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in water damage and music's refusal to march. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the acceptance of the score, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces ambiguity and resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by the musician's professional bias. Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose that supports accumulation. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing ghost story, political rebellion, and art with specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in setting and character. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
