<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Neris's charmed skepticism is embodied with contradictory impulses driving key choices; her final resolve to learn archiving is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her trembling and the garden's shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure via resonant reconfiguration from prisoner to archivist lands with felt cost in the garden's transformation and Neris's ghostly resolve, underpinned by consistent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Velvet garden and seashell function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Neris's POV to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Neris's agency from curiosity to self-confrontation; cost is legible in her emotional state and the reconfiguration of isolation into independence, aligning with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of quarantined memory emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Neris's archiving shift, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional pressure without head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and propulsive, especially in peak beats like the seashell vision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory quarantine and guilt transforms familiar tropes through specific particulars; risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
