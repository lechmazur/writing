<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with embodied emotion in lines like "the child was ash now." His defiance through the puppet head is a credible micro-choice that forecloses the expected path with visible cost, earning the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "the world did not end all at once." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the puppet head acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the lighthouse door requiring a spoken sequence. The broken puppet head functions as a micro-setting that constrains the climax and charges the final image facing the sea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (world's end vs. mercy) escalates through the adjuster's agency in adjusting small moments, driven by the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in "the world would still burn in places, but some rooms would now remain intact."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty and tenderness emerges through particulars like the puppet's "chipped, beautifully flawed devotion." The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting loss through the lullaby motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "mist clung to the black rocks like breath that had forgotten its owner." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision in time shifts are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "time thrumming like a trapped bird," and propulsion is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes doomsday and personal redemption with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details like the puppet head. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
