<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and prudent adventurousness are concretely embodied through micro-choices like reciting measurements under breath. Interior contradiction is vivid when walls "press like accusations" yet solitude steadies his lungs. Final descent is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in hesitation and acceptance of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as he descends the staircase, reconfiguring his rebellion against fear under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the line "every instinct clawing upward toward open sky." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and spatial mutiny's pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices at key beats, such as the corridors disagreeing with intuition, and charges the final image of the staircase "cut from compressed midnight." Sensory details like "air tasted like dust and old thunder" are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering the key escalates through protagonist's agency, like using the compass point to choose the central hall, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is felt when "the air itself might tighten until his ribs protested," and his descent forecloses escape with visible tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against spatial and internal constraints emerges through particulars like the temple's "wistful rebellion" and the final image of descent as "patient rebellion." No moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the silent music's plea and changed stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "starlight stitched a faint silver lattice." Rhythmic control under pressure, such as "walls uncoiled upward," and no head-hopping. Elision of dialogue is purposeful, focusing on interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "walking inside someone's slow, reluctant sigh" is coherent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of spatial mutiny is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the blueprint compass point transforms tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
