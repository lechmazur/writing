<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. Her motivation to confront personal grief is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned transformation. The final choice to fold cranes is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost ("Her heart feels flayed"). No significant weaknesses affect closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through vivid imagery to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is clear early, and the ritual's cost is legible on-page. The shadow's detachment incites the plot, and the basilica's role charges the ending without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral and sensory-rich, with the floating island and glass basilica constraining choices and mirroring internal states. Micro-setting elements like tools and lanterns are woven into action, charging the final image. Specificity enhances atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in internal grief escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable during memory polishing and crane folding. While purely internal, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though lack of external conflict slightly limits range.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like folding cranes, and the ending offers a non-literal reweighting of prior material. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful compression enhances clarity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, though minor purple tinge in peaks doesn't harm closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dream recording and grief transformation with fresh, inevitable specificity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates, and closure feels earned through character choice.</comment>
