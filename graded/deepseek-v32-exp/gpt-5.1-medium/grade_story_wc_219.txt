<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's "luminous skeptic" trait is consistently embodied through micro-choices like treating the pilgrimage as a question mark, and final endurance is earned. However, lacks overt contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise in the clearing, reconfiguring homecoming's meaning with cost legible in the waiting; accumulative lens holds strong via imagery and reflections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting (e.g., moss like handwriting) charges the final image of the spiral clearing, though it doesn't heavily constrain choices beyond guiding the path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding homecoming escalate through agency (following footprints, kneeling) under accumulative lens, with cost felt in the uncertain ending; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming emerges organically through motifs (fly amber, footprints) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic, reflective voice; no head-hopping and elision (e.g., footprints as equation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds; figurative language (e.g., "bronze quiet") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of first contact and pilgrimage feels inevitable, with specific details (fly amber, sculpture path) transforming tropes; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
