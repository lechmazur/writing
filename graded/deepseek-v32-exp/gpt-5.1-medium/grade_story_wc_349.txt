<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vendor's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His motivation to find where stories begin intensifies through interaction with the woman, leading to an earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the vendor's name appearing under Beginnings. The drive lens holds without contradiction, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the glass orchard library and bottled moonlight integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the shared use of bottled moonlight deepening stakes and revealing cost. The dominant stake of finding stories begin from omissions is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization that stories begin from cuts inside omissions. No moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
