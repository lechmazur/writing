<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and character-particular. Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses, such as the tension between scavenging and the ghost's critique. The final renunciation—upending pockets—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ghost absorbs the relics, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost on the page ("the ghost gathers the objects without touching them... until it is crowded with faint, overlapping selves"). Persistent constraint of eroded ambitions shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV bias (e.g., "lagoon finally remembers how to be still," "seagulls of clockwork and steam"). The kinetic lagoon constrains choices by being the site of scavenging and confrontation, and the disposable camera wheel charges the final image. Micro-setting elements like the skiff and carousel balustrades alter tactics and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with the ghost) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shift. Protagonist agency drives escalation—rowing to the center and offering relics—foreclosing options with cost legible in the ghost's rejection. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and self-negotiation emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the ghost's dialogue and the relics' symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's absorption of relics, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Diction and syntax reflect the narrator's mind state, and elision (e.g., memory jumps) is taught and paid off. Dialogue with the ghost is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "skin of mirrored gears"), with no loops, scaffold, or artifacts. Read-aloud ear test passes; clarity and momentum are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of surreal elements and emotional truth, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (e.g., ghost negotiation) are transformed through specific details and character choices. Risk-taking in abstract narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure integrates fully with the premise.</comment>
