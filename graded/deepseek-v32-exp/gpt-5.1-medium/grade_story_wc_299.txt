<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. His contradictory impulses—insulating with facts versus the jolt of recognition—act simultaneously in scene, and his final choice to write the note is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his emotional descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Eli's realization that "purpose after loss was enough." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details to reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the amp's discovery tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and amp function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the echo valley mirroring internal states and the grille cloth scrap pivotal to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the accumulative lens, from emotional insulation to the amp's discovery, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible in his resigned note, foreclosing a path with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss and purpose emerges through particulars like the amp and echo valley, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, via the final note's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature in Eli's professional bias and emotional rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and any elision (e.g., past failures) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "echo valley") enhances clarity without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the quiet ending heightening stakes. Specific lived detail (e.g., grille cloth) transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
