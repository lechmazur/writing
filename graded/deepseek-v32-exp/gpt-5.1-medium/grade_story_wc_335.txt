<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhea's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (combative tenderness, walking backwards when nervous) acting in scene; her motivation to mentor resilience is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the high-stakes choice to exile Jun reversibly. Jun's defiance and fear are vividly rendered, creating a crucible relationship that forces Rhea's final promise, earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise in Rhea's blade-like smile and guarantee, reconfiguring the stakes of exile with felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is anchored early, and the structure tightens through because/therefore linkages (Council's decree → Rhea's intervention → exile compromise) without ambiguity, culminating in a decisive change that forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library setting constrains choice through the mirror wall and tea leaves, charging the final image with atmospheric specificity; sensory details (dust glittering, shadows folding like ink) are selective and POV-filtered, evolving with the action to pressure Rhea's decisions and deepen the stakes of memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from Rhea's argument with the Council to the tea leaf reading with Jun, tightening options and legibly costing reversible exile; the dominant stake of memory banishment deepens through a meaningful turn where Rhea's promise forecloses permanent forgetting with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like reversible exile and tea leaf geometry, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and resilience without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures (Jun's snort, Rhea's touch) and the final image reweights prior material with complexity, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Rhea's lyrical yet sharp voice; dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Jun's tremor, Rhea's promise), and purposeful compression (e.g., "smiled like a drawn blade") heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence openings and no loops or artifacts; figurative language ("shadows stretching like ink in water") is coherent and purpose-driven, accelerating with scene needs without muddying peak beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of memory exile and tea leaf divination, transforming tropes with specific lived detail; risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, supported by bold character choices and conceptual integrity.</comment>
