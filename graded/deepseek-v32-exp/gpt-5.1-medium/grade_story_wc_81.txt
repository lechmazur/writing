<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the folio's revelation, reweighting the library's history.

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "water held respectfully still" constraining choices and charging the final image.
