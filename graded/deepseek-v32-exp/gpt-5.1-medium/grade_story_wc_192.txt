<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., silence "weighed on her chest like water"). Contradictory impulses act in scene through her careful bridge-burning and seeking the shadow keeper. The final choice to breathe is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the reconfiguration of her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mara's breathing moment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the sanctuary's recurring presence. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact, with the shadow keeper's revelation tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ashen charcoal sanctuary constraining choices and charging the final image (e.g., walls "arranged in broken circles" mirror Mara's internal state). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, from seeking the shadow keeper to linking scars. The dominant stake (internal conflict between drowning and breathing) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the breathing moment. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and breathing emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., linking scars) and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final bridge burning "in a different direction."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "loaded emptiness"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic variation. Purposeful elision (e.g., the shadow keeper's blurred edges) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and heightens pressure (e.g., "breath hitching in the loaded emptiness"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of internal struggle with symbolic elements like the shadow keeper and linking scars. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (e.g., "scars like dried rivers") avoid template plots.</comment>
