<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The immortal's boredom and dimensional awareness are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as pinning the amulet fragment. The final decision to redraw boundaries is earned by the prior spatial mutiny and the fragment's revelation, foreclosing endless safety with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, redefining goodbye as rearrangement with cost felt in the final image of loosening anchors. The solar storm and amulet fragment drive causality without breaks, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "knot and flare like anxious serpents" filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves with the storm, directly impacting the protagonist's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to existential risk under the Accumulative lens, driven by the protagonist's agency in engaging with the amulet and storm. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of space and the decision to permit final distance, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the spatial mutiny and the amulet's revelation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to goodbye as rearrangement. Subtext operates through images like "stretched, like skin after weight is lifted," avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "walls are at best polite suggestions." Poetic syntax and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "crown of bent nails," is purposeful and coherent, advancing story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortality with spatial concepts feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the amulet's disagreement with reality. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
