<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lan's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His internal conflict shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as trembling fingers guiding deliberate rune-writing, and the final renunciation of superstitions is earned by prior causality with visible cost in scars becoming margins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—scars rearranging into margins—under a causal lens that holds from start to end. The orientation is clear early, and the storm's patient waiting acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and charges the final image, making the cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock platform constrains choices by threatening disruption from gusts, and the crow quill charges the final image as an "inkwell of weather." Sensory details like tea steam and thunder are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lan's POV to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lan's agency under the causal lens, with each rune-writing beat deepening the stake of internal transformation. The cost is unmistakable in the rearrangement of scars, and the storm circling below maintains coherent pressure that tightens options until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming pain into strength emerges through concrete particulars like runes shaped from memory shards, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in scars becoming "margins instead of wounds," reweighting prior material through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Lan's stressed crystallization of thought. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "clear, cold shards of memory," and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, as in "the air was a breath between storms," and clarity is maintained even under lyrical pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of rune magic with psychological transformation feels inevitable and fresh, heightening stakes through specific details like the crow quill and storm. Risk-taking in the lyric style coheres with the premise, and the closure image of "luminous scars" offers a non-obvious angle on resilience.</comment>
