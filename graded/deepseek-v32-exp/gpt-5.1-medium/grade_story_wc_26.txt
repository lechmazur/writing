<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's characterization is deeply embodied, with his regret and motivation to tend lost possibilities driving his actions. His final choice to house the shadows is earned through prior causality, with visible cost when the shadow sinks into him, scorching with ache. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot under accumulative lens builds through imagery to a decisive conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible when Lio feels the "ache of it scorched him" and proposes a new protocol. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and closure reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the library and dreams constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "translucent petals of light" and "dust and magnetic tape" are purposeful and filtered through Lio's POV. The river stone object evolves in use, directly shaping the climax when the shadow winds around it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under accumulative lens through Lio's agency, from noticing the dusk change to absorbing the shadow. The dominant stake of preserving lost futures tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the "luminous regret burning through each word" as he requests the new protocol. No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hope and regret emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Lio's decision to house shadows, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the shadow pooling at his feet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in phrases like "dreams unfurling when called by name." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., Lane's backstory) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; climax beats like "the ache of it scorched him" are clear and propelled. Diction remains within Lio's lexicon, avoiding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of dream archives and unbound shadows, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific details like the river stone and video footage, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without gimmickry. Closure is bold and coherent.</comment>
