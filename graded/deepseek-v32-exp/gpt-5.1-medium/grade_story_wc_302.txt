<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict between dread and delight is embodied, and her renunciation of documentation is earned through on-page causality with visible cost when she burns the first letter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as she reconfigures her goal from documenting to embracing unresolvedness, cost legible in ink vanishing; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with patterns of silence building to climax; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges final image; library's rules pressure tactics, and misty atmosphere is woven into action with sensory specificity like "mist bead on her lashes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; she tests silence and shifts goal, with cost visible in letter burning; stakes tighten meaningfully though subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges through events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with her single sentence, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single PVO stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice controls rhythm under pressure, and elision (e.g., watch's behavior) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or artifacts in peak beats, figurative language purposeful, and sentences vary naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of library of unspoken words feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific choices.</comment>
