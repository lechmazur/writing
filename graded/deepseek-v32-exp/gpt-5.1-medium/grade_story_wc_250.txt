<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guardian's purpose ("to teach darkness the value of stars") is poetic but slightly abstract, though it drives action; dentist's guilt and change are earned through embodied micro-choices like shutter patterns and mirror use, with visible cost in his hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern escalation; closure lands with decisive change (dentist's call) and felt cost (halting words, guardian's relief), anchored early in cobalt dock setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (dock, water) constrains choices through reflections and charges closure; sensory details like "bruised glass" water and lamp gleams are purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under accumulative lens: silent communication tightens stakes, leading to dentist's call with cost (fear loosening); dominant stake (apology) is clear and tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken secrets and empathy emerges through images (light, water) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the phone call and fading constellations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV shifts between guardian and dentist are clear with section-break-like transitions; voice is distinct and poetic, though minor abstraction in guardian's motivation slightly limits perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control with no major artifacts; metaphors like "teach darkness the value of stars" are coherent and serve atmosphere without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silent empathy and non-verbal communication feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar redemption tropes.</comment>
