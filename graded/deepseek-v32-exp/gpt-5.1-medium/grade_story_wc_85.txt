<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt is concretely embodied and drives micro-choices; final decision to seek truth is earned by causal chain from watch discovery to carving realization, with cost legible in "quieter cruelty." Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and flaws complicate choices consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as decisive change from forging lies to studying truth, with cost felt in "tempered regret"; causal lens holds via because/therefore linkages (guilt → shore search → emblem match → choice). Orientation anchored early, and structure transitions cleanly from terrace to shore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (cobalt terrace, shore) and objects (watch, carvings) pressure choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "fingertips tracing each groove"). Spatial choreography from terrace to shore is coherent and mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. falsehood) escalates under causal lens via protagonist's agency—guilt drives shore visit, discovery forces reckoning. Cost is unmistakable in realization that past comfort carried "quieter cruelty," narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges through particulars (watch, carvings) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via image of gathering carvings. Subtext operates in gestures like the "sieved hush" echoing generational regret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "gap in its face gapes back at me like a tooth pulled from time"); voice is lyrical yet consistent, and elision (e.g., note's meaning) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "pulse with no beat"). Sentences advance story and character under pressure, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of black market genealogist offers fresh synthesis; turns feel earned through character-specific detail (e.g., driftwood code). Risk-taking in lyrical introspection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
