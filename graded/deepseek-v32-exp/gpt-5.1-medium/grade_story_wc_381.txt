<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "chest tightened" during the hushing, and micro-choices like placing the crane reveal his values. The tranquil blaze metaphor effectively captures his resolved yet contained purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Ilen feels "weight added to his bones" under an accumulative textural lens; orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reconfiguring silence and possibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the brook and crane constraining choices; the environment charges the final image as the "brook accepted" the light, altering the atmosphere and supporting the theme of silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start with the prophecy's threat; escalation is driven by Ilen's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his physical burden during the hushing and the unraveling of prophecy threads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the fireflies' "new patterns suggesting futures," avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm control under pressure; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision in the mapping silence method is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with good propulsion; minor overwriting in phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" but no loops or artifacts that harm closure, and figurative language enhances atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, with the method of mapping silence forming a non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with coherence, and the combination of elements feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
