<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jonas's prosopagnosia and methodical approach are deeply integrated, driving his choices and the narrative. His motivation to awaken empathy is consistent and compels high-stakes actions, with embodied emotion in lines like "stirring layers of time."

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon and painting, offering a non-literal answer on justice through empathy without moralizing.

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold.
