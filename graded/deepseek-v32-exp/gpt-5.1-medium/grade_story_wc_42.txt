<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilias's interiority is concrete and embodied under pressure, with micro-choices like overriding locks revealing his hierarchy of values. His motivation, rooted in Alma's teachings, intensifies compellingly to risk the equipment for capturing the stellar death. The final choice to hold the configuration steady is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the quake's danger and legacy stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—Ilias's success in capturing the data amid the quake, sealing it with "stolen clarity." The Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, driven by the stellar event and quake linked to his actions. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the shaking foundations shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting pressures choices, with the quake and tools like the trembling array constraining Ilias's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional bias, such as "micrometeorites ticking against the hull." The environment charges the final image by mirroring internal stakes—risk versus ephemeral capture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the stellar death escalates under the Hybrid lens through Ilias's agency—overriding protocols and restructuring circuitry—amid the quake's pressure. Cost is legible in the risk to equipment and survival, with one meaningful tightening as he bypasses filters to secure the data. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral emerges through events and Alma's voice, not direct statement, with subtext in images like the "raw, burning stream" of data. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sealed archive, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity arises from the tension between risk and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, professional lexicon reflecting Ilias's expertise. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., syntax tightens during the quake. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., Alma's backstory) is anchored in present cues and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "trembling like teeth in an old jaw" is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; propulsion remains clear through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of sci-fi and philosophical themes, with specific details like the "clock hand that won't stop spinning" transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from established pattern. Non-obvious angle on ephemeral capture and legacy.</comment>
