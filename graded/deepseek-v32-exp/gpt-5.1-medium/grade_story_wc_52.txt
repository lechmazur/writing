<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through concrete actions like whitening knuckles around the carving blank, with internal conflict between stasis and creation dramatized in micro-choices. Her final decision to carve arises from earned causality—Luca's practicality reframing grief—with visible cost in the closure image. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels authentic and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, with sensory and memory density escalating to a Charged Poise closure as Mara draws the first line. Cost is legible in the final sentence's reconfiguration of absence into utility. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; structure's two-shard design (present reflection → past memory) teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft and ash wood blank function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image—the skylight softens memory, the blank demands a future form. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., steam clouding glass "softening the gray sky into memory"). Spatial choreography remains clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grieving versus creating tightens through accumulative density, culminating in Mara's agency to carve. Escalation is driven by her reflections on Luca's practicality, forcing a trade-off between stasis and utility. Cost is unmistakable in the final beat's "opening the wood so something useful can stay," foreclosing passive mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief through practicality emerges organically from particulars—Luca's checked latches, Mara's carving—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the carving's first line, reweighting prior motifs of pauses and wildness. Subtext operates in gestures like containing the blank's smoothness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet precise, reflecting Mara's circus-honed attention. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure (e.g., short clauses in peak beats). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., Luca's death) is taught and paid off in the closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a small mute animal") is coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image is sharp; read-aloud ear test passes with natural momentum and no register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of circus grit and literary grief, transforming the widow trope through specific, grounded details like ash wood's forgiveness. Risk-taking in quiet intensity heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
