<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nari's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her loss of Haru, with embodied emotions like pressing the amber bead to her lips. Her decision to unweave the tapestry is an earned sacrifice, foreclosing a path with visible cost, and her internal conflict is dramatized in scene. The characterization avoids stock phrasing and shows micro-choices under pressure, such as trading wool for the puzzle, which aligns with her consistent traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages: Nari's desire to reach Haru drives her to the puzzle, leading to the sacrificial unweaving. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as footsteps turn in the puzzle, reconfiguring possibilities with cost legible in the bare loom. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, supporting the ending's felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard and bamboo forest filtering through Nari's POV to pressure choices, such as solitude making "the threads listen." Sensory details like "frost silvered the fallen apples" are selective and integrated into action. The puzzle and loom function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reaching Haru escalates under the causal lens through Nari's agency: finding the puzzle, fitting pieces, and sacrificing the tapestry. This tightening forecloses options with visible cost (the unwove tapestry) and alters knowledge, as the puzzle reveals Haru's figure. Pressure coheres without coincidence, and the cost is unmistakable in the orchard feeling "abruptly older."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the amber bead and unweaving, exploring memory and sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., hanging the bead on the puzzle) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the footsteps, reweighting prior material. The emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Nari's lyrical voice filters the world through her wistful perspective. Prose rhythm and syntax reflect her state, such as the compressed diction in peak beats ("she unwove her tapestry"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., the puzzle's mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "the loom stood bare and skeletal" is coherent and voice-motivated. No register drift or artifact issues; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes weaving and puzzles in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like the amber bead and raveling silence creating an organic whole. Risk-taking in the lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation of tropes through character-driven choices feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
