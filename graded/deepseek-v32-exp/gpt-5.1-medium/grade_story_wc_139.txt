<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., unpicking stitches) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final decision to split the equation is earned by prior causality and embodied emotion, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from discovery to decision. Closure is a decisive change (splitting the equation) with felt cost on the page, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (funeral home prep room) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "formaldehyde and whispers" integrated into action. The ink pot and body function as micro-settings that pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (asylum vs. moral balance) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with a tightening choice (using the ink) that narrows options and carries cost in the breach decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "fair trade" emerges through particulars like the equation and ink, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication, e.g., "a living imbalance that favors the broken."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., the equation's symbols) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "numbers no longer cliffs but rivers" is coherent and heightens peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of con artistry, funeral work, and mathematical redemption feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and moral calculus heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor universals.</comment>
