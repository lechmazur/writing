<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority, such as "boots sinking into hot sand as if wading through years," and her final choice to graft stories with the coin earns its cost through prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she carries both her father's and chief's voices, driving her agency under pressure. The easing inside at closure shows a credible endurance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maris's action reconfigures her past legacy, felt in "something quiet inside finally ease." The hybrid causal-textural lens holds, with events linked by because/therefore logic, such as her father's history shaping her response to the boy. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand constrict choices, charging the final image where "kelp-drift peace curling" mirrors Maris's internal shift. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "salt clung to the smoke," integrating environment with action. Micro-setting elements pressure tactics, as the fire's approach to the lagoon forces Maris's decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maris's agency under the hybrid lens, as the fire "inching toward his skinny ankles" tightens options, compelling her to turn her back on flames. Cost is unmistakable when "heat kiss the back of her neck" and her emotional ease signals a trade-off. The dominant stake of internal vs. external conflict deepens through a single meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, such as the boy's curse mirroring Maris's father, leading to a non-literal answer in her advice to "return it together." Subtext operates in gestures like the jar and coin grafting stories, resisting moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity about compassion and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Maris's perceptual signature evident in professional calculus like "run the numbers in her head." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as the boy's explanation of the curse carries subtext. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control in phrases like "gracefully alert to every crackle."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, such as "lagoon waited like an unblinking eye," is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the crisis, maintaining clarity and momentum through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of an arsonist's daughter firefighter offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the black sand and coin. Emotional truth arises from grounded choices, such as Maris's reply to her father's legacy, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in hybrid structure and lyric resonance heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
