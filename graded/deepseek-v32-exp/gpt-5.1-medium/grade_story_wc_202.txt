<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final realization and acceptance of the lighthouse lens fragment are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shame over past translations. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between professional neutrality and the desire to honor overlooked histories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the lighthouse lens fragment, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost (shame). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with the meeting and gift flowing naturally from the protagonist's quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, such as the "creaking boards" and "dangling glass," and constrains choices (e.g., the market's outer rail guiding the protagonist's path). The environment charges the final image, with the lighthouse lens fragment acting as a micro-setting object that deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency, culminating in the acceptance of the fragment with visible cost. The deepening changes knowledge and options, foreclosing past neutrality with a felt price in the shame realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars like the lighthouse lens fragment and painted details, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the "footnotes of the lost," and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the translator's worldview. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the painter's cryptic dialogue) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains character-bound and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the shame realization. Momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of concepts (e.g., the alchemist's market and anchors of intuition), transformed via specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
