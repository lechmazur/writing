<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leila's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like brushing the sundial base. Her final choice to stay traces a circle instead of a line is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fragile continuity felt. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her conflict between observer and restorer roles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sundial alignment brings fragile continuity, with cost legible in Leila's breathing "as if for the first time." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building patterns to this moment. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the catacomb orchard and sundial base constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "fermenting fruit, rainstone" are filtered through Leila's POV, and the environment shapes tactics, such as the trench collapse revealing the pattern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leila's agency under the accumulative lens, from her curiosity to proposing the garden, with cost unmistakable in the disruption and alignment. The dominant stake of restoring faith tightens through meaningful turns, and the resolution is earned with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and faith emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with the final image of the circle offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like Rafi's trembling hands, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Leila's bias. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Rafi's cautious enchantment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "roots curling around skulls like protective hands," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the sundial alignment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the specific synthesis of diaspora, faith, and time through the catacomb orchard and sundial, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through grounded details.</comment>
