<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., "lungs burned," "fear panting"). Internal conflict shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final descent is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara descends, with memories forming steps and the star answering; cost is legible in the confrontation of past failures. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "mist held the harbor," "wooden walkway slick with mist"), with sensory details that pressure choices. The environment constrains the journey, and recurring objects like the ticket punch charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's internal conflict between fear and courage; escalation is driven by her agency (running, knocking, descending). Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with memory steps, and cost is legible in the final hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of courage and self-discovery emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in dialogue and gesture; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., ferry guides' lines). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of internal journey with ferry mythos; specific details (ticket punch, star stamp) feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
