<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to graft onto community is clear and intensifies through the search; his internal conflict between solitude and connection is embodied in micro-choices, such as settling beside Mira, and his final decision to create a participatory sculpture is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing through the final image of the sculpture braiding voices, reweighing belonging with cost legible in "luminescent ache"; the Accumulative lens holds, with pattern taught early and orientation anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "glittering dust" and "cooled night" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elian's agency in the shared search, deepening stakes to kinship webs; cost is unmistakable in his decision to forge community through art, narrowing options with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through particulars like Siltghost's tag and the sculpture concept; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "webs of kinship" without moralizing, reweighting prior material through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "hands permanently greened with sap"; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and dialogue with Mira carries subtext and goal-driven rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "luminescent ache" is cohesive and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mundane and magical elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific detail like crystal pears and marsh reeds.</comment>
