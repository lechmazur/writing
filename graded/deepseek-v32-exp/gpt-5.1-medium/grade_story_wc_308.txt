<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final choice of stillness is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing physical movement. Micro-choices under pressure, like skimming stones and aligning with the bone tower, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the final stillness. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by pattern and echo. Orientation is clear early, and the pulse constraint shapes tactics, culminating in "he finally knew where he was."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (sound of echoes, sight of bone towers) that constrains choice and charges the final image. The canyon and bone towers pressure the protagonist's actions, altering tactics through sound mapping and hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (skimming stones, reading birds), leading to a deepening that reweights the stake of navigation. Cost is legible in the renunciation of physical movement for internal stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigation through stillness emerges from events and images without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization that the pulse is collective memory, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and pattern. Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and closure is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of navigation, memory, and echoes feels inevitable. Specific details (stone skimming, pulse) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
