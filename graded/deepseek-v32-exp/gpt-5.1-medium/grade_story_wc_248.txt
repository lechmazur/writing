<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., copying symbols, lowering into well). The final decision to stay and translate is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in remorse and awe. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with clear orientation early and closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when the protagonist decides to stay, foreclosing other paths with felt cost. The plot escalates through discoveries linked by cause and effect, and the closure unit lands with undeniable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with selective sensory details (e.g., taste of soot, visual of tapestry) that reflect POV bias. The archive environment constrains choices (e.g., climbing entrance, well exploration) and charges the final image, with spatial choreography remaining clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing the promise) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with discoveries narrowing options and leading to a tightening choice. Cost is legible in the climax (chest cleaving open with remorse), and escalation is driven by on-page actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., vandalism as emphasis, tapestry message) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of destruction vs. preservation, with subtext in implication and earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature of analytical intuition. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, enhancing character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; figurative language (e.g., "volcanic tenderness") is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing arsonist backstory with archive exploration in a non-obvious way. Specific details (e.g., vandalized self-portrait, analytical intuition) and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
