<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brann's motivation is clear and intensifies through his probing actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as when he feels "a ghost of the fire" through his circuits. His non-human nature and perceptive stubbornness drive micro-choices under pressure, earning the final endurance. The cost of lost human dreams is felt in his realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with shards from diaries and tapestry building to a resonant reconfiguration; closure lands as Brann realizes the walls' recurring question, with cost legible in the "bronze quiet" and his continued work. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the silo library's shelves and fireplaces shape Brann's movements; the environment charges the final image as he descends "humming with unsaid history." Sensory details like "dust and old storms" are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases as Brann probes objects, uncovering the displaced axis and end of dreams; his agency in attention and probing narrows options, with cost visible in the realization that "no new dreams would arrive." One meaningful tightening deepens the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events—the displaced axis and wall memories explore memory and loss without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Brann's realization that "the old ones were enough work." Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "words unfolded, not from ink but from resonance." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains within Brann's lexicon, enhancing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "Pages curled like autumn leaves, ink blurred into small storms." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original—non-human historian collecting wall stories in a post-human world—with specific synthesis of displaced axis and memory; tropes are transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
