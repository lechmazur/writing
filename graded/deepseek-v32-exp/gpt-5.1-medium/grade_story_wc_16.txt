<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of cowardice and regret; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like fear prickling and cautious exuberance. Micro-choices under pressure, such as dipping the pen and inscribing vows, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final change—vow settling in his throat—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost as the vow changes his breath and limits half-truths, legible in "I felt the vow settle into my throat." Orientation is clear within 120 words (who, where, when). Persistent constraint of the vow shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (dust, light like a patient eye) and constrains choice—the archive supplies the Arithene method that enables the apology. The ink well recurs and charges the final image with its tremor. Sensory selection reflects urgency, filtered through POV bias as a linguist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust) escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency—seeking and applying the Arithene method. Cost is unmistakable in the vow's structural impossibility of lying, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs as the vows interconnect, foreclosing evasion with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and silence emerges through events and images (e.g., ink well as talisman, vows as lattice), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "a new music learning how to be a symphony of truth," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, linguist-filtered observations like "shelves curved like fossilized ribs." Rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "My heart hammered a frantic rhythm, but beneath it something steadier rose." No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., Liora's off-page presence) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("symphonies of truth," "ossuary of speech") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the vow's completion, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of extinct linguistics and emotional apology feels inevitable; the "symphonies of truth" concept transforms the trope through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reconfigures meaning with cost.</comment>
