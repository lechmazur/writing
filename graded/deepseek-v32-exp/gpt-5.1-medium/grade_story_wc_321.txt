<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eli's ardent devotion and secret motivation to merge timelines are consistently shown through micro-choices like tuning the radio and humming, with his final decision to "choose home" earned by prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hope versus the tingling teeth warning, and cost is legible in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Eli "chose home," reweighting the premise with undeniable cost under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The orientation is clear early, and causality holds from radio patterns to grotto appearance, with the final image making cost felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the closure: the ferry's reality-shifting and the spectral grotto with overlain subway routes pressure Eli's decision. Sensory details like "wet moonlight" and "static like metal bees" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eli's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the Hybrid lens, from tuning the radio to aiming the note at absence, with cost unmistakable in his choice to forego other possibilities. The dominant stake of merging timelines tightens through the ferry's shift and grotto revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of permanence versus transience emerges through particulars like the empty hourglass and overlapping ferries, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "chose home" that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, e.g., "clocks run sideways," and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision in radio patterns is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "braided melody" is coherent and purposeful, and syntax varies naturally to support momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes a fresh, non-obvious premise of a vanishing ferry with specific details like the sandless hourglass, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical surrealism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept is fully committed.</comment>
