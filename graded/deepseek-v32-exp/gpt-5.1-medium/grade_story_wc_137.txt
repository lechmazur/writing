<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's sympathetic skepticism is consistently embodied, with internal conflict between doubt and wonder driving micro-choices like touching the tile and transcribing. The final earned reconfiguration—doubt growing spacious enough to hold wonder—lands with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where doubt transforms, with cost legible in the final sentence. Orientation is clear early, and the tile's persistent constraint shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower and tile function as micro-setting that constrains choice (transcription on parapet) and charges the final image with fog and whales. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of memories and whale song, driven by protagonist's agency in transcription. Cost is unmistakable as doubt reconfigures without breaking, foreclosing pure skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of skepticism versus wonder emerges organically through particulars like the tile and whales, with the ending offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—reflective, skeptical, yet moved—evident in rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory shifts) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "unheard symphony") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skepticism, entangled memories, and quiet reflection feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric climax heightening stakes. Specific details (tile, whales) avoid derivative premises, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
