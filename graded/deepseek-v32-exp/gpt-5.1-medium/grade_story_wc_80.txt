<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply layered with contradictory impulses—her official duty versus her secret archive—embodied in micro-choices like placing notes. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned stance of endurance with visible cost in the final image. The trait "stoically sensitive" constrains actions, avoiding label-only mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in "absence, properly mapped, can burn," under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres through a single scene transition to the pavilion, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the submerged pavilion and inkwell constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details like "salt light" and "slick steps" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as repeated note-placing deepens the stake against forgetting. Cost is legible in her labor and the final image of "hidden sentences," though the conflict remains internal without external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through particulars like the boy on the seawall and grandfather's inkwell, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "hushed blaze," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in phrases like "echo the tide leaves behind." Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits flawless rhythm and high information density, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "drowned lantern" is consistent and purposeful, accelerating pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of surveyor and archaeologist of dreams, with specific details like the inkwell feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
