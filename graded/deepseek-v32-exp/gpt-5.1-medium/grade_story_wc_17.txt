<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "hands slick with rust"). Final choice to stay and listen is earned by prior causality with visible cost (legacy's burden). Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hesitation versus commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as narrator decides to stay, with cost legible in "Legacy's burden pressed down." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layers of sound and memory. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight from inciting incident to discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., ivy-veiled passage and blackened room shape discoveries). Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered ("air tasted like wet stone and forgotten ink"). Micro-setting (diaries, film strip) actively influences the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, from humming to discovering diaries, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the burden of legacy and decision to stay. Dominant stake (discovering past) tightens meaningfully with each beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges organically from particulars like echoes and diaries, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the narrator's commitment to listen. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature ("hearing layers of conversation the way others read palimpsests"). Voice modulation under pressure is controlled, and elision (e.g., Mara's backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "pages charred at the edges like petals touched by frost"). Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build-up to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing echo cartography with climate shifts into an organic whole. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel earned and inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to the concept.</comment>
