<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingers smelled of walnut ink and salt"). The final choice to write is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the haunted euphoria. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between preserving memory and confronting loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where writing reconfigures memory's weight with felt cost ("heart steeped in that same haunted euphoria"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in imagery escalating to the final image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the covenant's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (e.g., "barnacle roses opening into slick mouths"). The jetty and ledger constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memory escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases (e.g., Mara's appearance). Protagonist agency in writing drives deepening, with cost legible in the euphoria. Pressure coheres and tightens, foreclosing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and regeneration emerges through particulars like the locket and covenant, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the heavy paper image. Subtext operates in gestures and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "paper that can bruise"). Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue, though minimal, carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven (e.g., "sea curled upward like a page"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes memory and magic realism with specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., archivist role). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
