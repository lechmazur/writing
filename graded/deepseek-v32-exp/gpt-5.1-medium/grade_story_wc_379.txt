<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling the intrusion "pricking under her skin" and hosting dawn circles. Her final action with the locket is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the mailbox opening and document discovery, reconfiguring the stakes under a causal lens; cost is legible in the community's emotional weight and the courtyard's salvation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the locked mailbox as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "bougainvillea spilled like open veins" and the courtyard constraining choices by hosting circles and mailboxes. The environment charges the final image, as the mailbox resolution directly impacts the outcome, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the courtyard escalates through Mara's agency, from hosting circles to solving the mystery, with cost unmistakable in the collective effort and revealed document. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the causal lens, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges organically from events and images, such as the locket's "click" and story circles, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the document saving the courtyard. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic, character-specific perception like "sandstorm calm" and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "metal shutters yawned," is purposeful and coherent, and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh and specific, synthesizing community storytelling with a mystery in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
