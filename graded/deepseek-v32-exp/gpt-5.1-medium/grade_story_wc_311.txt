<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His shift from harvester to namer is earned by the child sacrifice backstory, and his enduring stasis carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the reaper listening to nameless songs, reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost. The Accumulative lens holds, reinforced by ritual repetition. Orientation is clear early, and the method constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the observatory, lantern, and phonograph constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the reaper's POV, enhancing tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the reaper's agency in repeating the ritual, deepening the emotional weight and cost of his regret. The dominant stake of naming fears tightens through each crystallization, with visible price in the crystallized shards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice, memory, and naming fears emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the ongoing work, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., scattered light method) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied syntax and strong rhythm advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, transforming the reaper trope through specific choices in character and ritual. Emotional truth and risk-taking in poetic style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
