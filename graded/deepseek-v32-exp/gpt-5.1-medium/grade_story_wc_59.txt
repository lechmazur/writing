<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prince's internal conflict is vividly embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values; his shift from duty to custodianship is earned by the egg's discovery and memory of wings, with visible cost in rejecting syndicates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the prince commits to protecting the egg, foreclosing his prior path with felt cost; causal lens holds strong from discovery to vigil, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the suspended palace and mechanical world constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "damp, a bedraggled prince of rust" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of beauty vs. efficiency escalate through the prince's agency, tightening with the egg's discovery; his decision to assemble resources carries visible cost in defying the syndicates and philosophers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reawakening beauty emerges through concrete events and images like the egg and flawed genesis, with subtext in the contrast between artificial and natural worlds; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction reflecting the prince's perception; dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language like "egg the color of old moonlight" enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is freshly synthesized, transforming tropes through specific details like the Continuum Engine and egg; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
