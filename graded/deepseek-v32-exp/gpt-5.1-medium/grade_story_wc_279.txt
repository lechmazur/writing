<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's characterization is concrete with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; her skepticism and socially perceptive eye drive key turns, and her final choice to draw is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she kneels, showing a credible change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in Lark's realization that "she could never again pretend her art was harmless" and her kneeling to draw; the lens holds without ambiguity, and the tile flake constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, pressuring choices through the mist and mandala; the tile flake and sand mandala recur as micro-settings that constrain Lark's actions and charge the final image with her drawing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lark's agency under the Accumulative lens, from picking up the tile flake to interjecting with the boy; cost is unmistakable in her frightened realization and decision to draw, foreclosing her prior innocence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the mandala's destruction and Lark's drawing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about framing chaos without moralizing, supported by subtext in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet consistent, and the minimal dialogue carries subtext without head-hopping, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "lilac unease" is purposeful and clear, and syntax accelerates with scene needs, avoiding obscurity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of chalk art with spiritual ritual, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like the tile flake transform familiar tropes.</comment>
