<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, embodied in her role shift from translator to confessor. Her micro-choice to read the cast despite surgical urgency reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final act of taking the coral is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her neutral stance with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mara's pocketing of the coral and blurred reflection, reconfiguring meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in "blurred but undeniably afraid." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending charges prior imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the atrium's mist and glass frame the tension, while the brain coral and cast function as micro-settings that dictate Mara's actions. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "jungle hush" and "plaster grayed by camp dust," avoiding ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her decision to decrypt the cast and lie about the message tightens the stakes around shared humanity. Cost is unmistakable in the mother's choked sob and Mara's fear, reweighting the dominant stake of meaning versus medical procedure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coral and cast messages, culminating in a non-literal answer: "proof that our fear meant we were still human." Subtext operates in gestures (mother pressing the coral) and lies, resisting moralizing while offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature; Mara's voice blends lyrical reflection ("sedimentary scars") with crisis narrowing. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "shrewdly innocent," and any elision (e.g., the unparsed message) is taught and paid off in the lie.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("lotus-hearted ache") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence propulsion varies naturally with the Accumulative lens, and peak beats avoid muddle, sustaining momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of conflict-zone realism with lyric meditation on translation. The coral-as-shrapnel concept transforms a trope through specific, grounded choices, and risk-taking in voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
