<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The janitor's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His shift from cleaning to witnessing is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his emotional ache and whispered promise. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his comfort with mops yet listening for something beneath silence, motivating his final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the janitor's realization and promise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and imagery to a final image that reweights meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lantern glass inciting incident triggers coherent escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail (dust like crushed nebulae, ozone tang) that reflects POV bias. The station and lantern glass constrain choices and charge the final image, as projections reshape the janitor's perception and agency. Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal search for meaning) escalates under the Accumulative lens through the lantern glass's revelations, deepening the janitor's knowledge. Agency in his decision to witness forecloses his prior invisibility with visible cost in his chest ache and spacious hurt. Pressure coheres and tightens once meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and vulnerability emerges organically through events and images, such as the falling stars as questions and the final promise. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the broom as a staff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, filtering setting through the janitor's priorities. Purposeful elision (e.g., his unnamedness) is taught and pays off in closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("white scars across the black," "marrow bare") is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of cosmic and mundane, with the janitor's role transformed through specific, grounded choices. The lantern glass and flourishing stillness concept offer a non-obvious angle, and risks in lyrical prose heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
