<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's phobias and internal conflict are embodied and concrete; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. The shift from fear to empowerment is earned through the child's interaction, with visible cost in the resolve to confront the studio. Minor hairline slip: epiphany feels slightly rapid but anchored in on-page cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (protagonist's resolve to weaponize vulnerability) with felt cost under causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words; linkages are logical from betrayal to child's cipher to final stance. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of identity loss shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains choices and charges the final image through decay and isolation. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "metal ribs gone orange," seashell hiss). Micro-setting (child's cast) functions as environment that alters tactics, supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity and agency escalates under causal lens via protagonist's agency (decision to rewrite purpose after decrypting the cast). Cost is legible in the trembling certainty to confront the studio. One meaningful tightening forecloses passive endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through particulars (seashell, cast codes) without moralizing. Ending offers non-literal answer via protagonist's resolve; subtext in gestures (child's grin, shell's whisper). Earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (phobia-ridden observations). Voice modulates under pressure ("shaking quiet" to "steady" resolve). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "body kinked like a wire"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with climax; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of stunt double's identity crisis synthesizes fresh, non-obvious angle on betrayal. Specific details (seashell, cast codes) transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
