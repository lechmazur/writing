<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mareh's motives are clear and rooted in exile and memory preservation, with interiority shown through embodied emotion. The final choice to inscribe the stranger is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in memory loss. Contradictory impulses act in scene when exile trembles, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (memory loss) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reconfiguring the garden from exile to rebellion. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight with gaps aligning. The persistent constraint of observed gaps shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the garden and lagoon constraining choices (e.g., dancing in mirrored paths). Sensory details are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image. Micro-setting elements like the black glass roots integrate into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the stranger's arrival increasing risk and leading to the inscribed act. Cost is legible in memory loss, and stakes are clear and felt. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rebellion emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the memory loss, and the final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., gaps) is taught and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports pressure, with clear propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dystopia and poetic elements, with tropes transformed through specific details like tide dancing. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the ending feels inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
