<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tammuz's frugality and encrypted devotion are consistently embodied through micro-choices like tracing the tile and adjusting lights, with his final acceptance of doubt earned by prior causality and visible cost—years of work foreclosing certainty. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution demonstrates credible endurance with a felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost—"a quiet, usable doubt" reweights his pursuit—under the Accumulative/Textural lens, which holds throughout via density increase. Orientation is clear early; causality is tight, with the experiment driving the climax. The persistent constraint of his devotion shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The palace setting pressures choices by enabling the projection experiment, with sensory details like "incense, dust, and low electrical hum" filtered through Tammuz's POV. The courtyard and tile function as micro-settings that charge the final alignment scene. Specificity is purposeful and constrains action, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase—from setup to stellar alignments—driven by Tammuz's agency, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. The dominant stake (validating the magic square) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of doubt is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the magic square and alignment, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final question "he could never exhaust." Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Tammuz's astronomical focus—e.g., "stars wandered close to one hovering junction." Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off, such as in the closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "beams rose like invisible columns" advancing multiple roles without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion, passing the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes astronomy and ancient artifact in a fresh, non-obvious way, transformed through Tammuz's specific devotion. Risk-taking in the quiet, doubt-based closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
