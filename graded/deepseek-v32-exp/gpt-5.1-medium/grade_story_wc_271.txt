<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariam's characterization is deeply embodied, with tremors and freezing responses conveying trauma without diagnostic speak. Her micro-choices, like folding the photograph, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final resilience feels earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her somatic markers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory details and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration in the "pearl of stillness." Closure lands on-page with felt cost as she folds the photograph and walks steadily. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lighthouse keeper's absence persistently shapes the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is vividly specific, with salt fog and grinding waves pressuring Mariam's introspection. The fig leaf tracing directly constraints choice by echoing her past henna work, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internalized around coping with trauma, escalating through somatic responses like freezing at gull dives. Agency in endurance and notebook writing forecloses paths with cost legible in her trembling. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through particulars like the pearl metaphor and sea lavender, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the "pearl of stillness," reweighting prior wreckage without tidy resolution. Subtext operates in gestures like folding the photograph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending lyrical prose with trauma-filtered observation. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the ocean kept its own counsel." No head-hopping; elision in memory flashes is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "memory came uninvited, like smoke under a door," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats, clarity untouched in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drone strike survivor, somatic trauma, and arboretum setting feels inevitable in hindsight. The "pearl of stillness" concept transforms familiar resilience tropes through specific, grounded imagery. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
