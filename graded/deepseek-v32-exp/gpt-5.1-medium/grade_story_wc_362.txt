<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to report to the town is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is dramatized, such as the sigh when sent back to town, showing contradictory impulses. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the final line, reweighting the premise through the protagonist's actions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the quartz arbor to frost pattern linkage is coherent. Cost is legible in the town's attentive hush and the protagonist's truthful lies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cold column" and "frost feathered" filtering through POV. The quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally, such as the mist carrying unspoken arguments. Economy of detail supports momentum without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens through protagonist agency, from quarry visit to frost reading and door-to-door reporting. Cost is legible in the town's shifted attention and the protagonist's acknowledgment of scientific dismissal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prism refracts memories, deepening options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as the frost patterns holding emotions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final line. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the mirror flashing relief. No moralizing or thematic echo; complexity arises from particulars, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "listening so carefully that even furniture seemed to clear its throat." Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. No head-hopping; diction stays within the mystic's lexicon, and elision (e.g., the diner incident) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "bones the mountain had decided to wear" are coherent and purposeful. Syntax accelerates with pressure, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, such as the frost reading scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of magic realism and emotional theory, transformed through specific details like the quartz arbor and frost patterns. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. No template plots; authenticity stems from the protagonist's unique stance and the town's reconfiguration.</comment>
