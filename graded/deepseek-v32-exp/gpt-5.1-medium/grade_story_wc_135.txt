<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to compile fragments is clear and consistently drives her actions, with concrete interiority like "the words tasting both official and broken." Her reactive visionary trait shapes micro-choices, such as placing the valve to invite response, earning the climax. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the "unsure music" allows absences to navigate toward meaning, with cost legible in the tremulous note. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned intervals; orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of absences shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, e.g., "ivory harbor after rain gleamed like a polished bone," with sensory detail integrated into action. The harbor and valve constrain choices and charge the final image, avoiding generic description. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of compiling fragments is signaled early; escalation is driven by Mara's agency in placing the valve and speaking, tightening under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in Caven's "thin, tremulous note." No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absences and meaning emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the silent valve. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the hovering note, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm, e.g., "through staggered intervals of walking, listening, and writing." Voice modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "hope was just another kind of fragment." Read-aloud test passes; clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-exile recovery through an archivist's lens, with fresh angle on fragments and absences. Tropes are transformed via specific details like the trumpet valve. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
