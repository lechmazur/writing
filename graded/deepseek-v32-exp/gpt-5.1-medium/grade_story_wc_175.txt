<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Erin's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., adjusting structures) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her motivation to honor overlooked histories drives key turns, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the butterfly's transient arrival. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by patterns of migration and building. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of transience shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains choices and supplies resources for Erin's signals, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "ferns exhaling mist"), with spatial choreography coherent and tone supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Erin's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her building and adjustments. The dominant stake (honoring history) tightens through pattern shifts, though the escalation is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., the moth wing, temporary structures), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing, and reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflected in rhythmic control and poetic diction. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure, enhancing pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of transience and memory, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., grotto, butterfly) feel inevitable in hindsight, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
