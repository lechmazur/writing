<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eren's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like counting absences. His "respectfully rebellious" nature is embodied in micro-choices, such as bowing at checkpoints while smuggling, and the final stance on the storm is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with Mara's decision to uncork the storm, reconfiguring options with cost legible in the final line. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and dialogue. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of the border shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the arcade's failing lights and drone-ignored space enable the trade, while the bottle's presence alters the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eren's POV. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from Eren's delivery to Mara's risk assessment, with cost unmistakable in the storm's potential damage. Dominant stake of healing through broken promises tightens meaningfully. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of broken promises and healing emerges through particulars like linked absences and the storm bottle, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as Mara's nod as ritual. No moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Eren's poetic, observant voice remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Mara. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "bruised cobalt sky" mirrors conflict. Sentences advance story without momentum loss; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of mailman in disputed territory with magical realism (thunderstorm in a bottle). Tropes are transformed through specific details like smuggling drones and linking absences. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
