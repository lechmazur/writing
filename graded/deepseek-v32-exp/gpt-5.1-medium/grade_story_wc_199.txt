<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to decode leaves is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like "coolness seep up the arm, mossy delight tingling in veins." The final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of mere listening with visible cost. Internal conflict between sorting and planting is dramatized, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lio planting seeds, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in "the valley felt a new story beginning," and the structure coheres with no orientation debt. The voice interaction tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "smell of wet stone and sap" and micro-setting elements like seeds and leaves shaping Lio's actions. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and the environment pressures tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lio's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the moonstone leaf and voice interaction deepening stakes. The dominant stake of decoding messages tightens into planting, foreclosing options with cost. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as monuments to forgotten things, with subtext in Lio's shift from listening to speaking. The ending offers a non-literal answer through planting seeds, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "leaves loosened from the arbor's upper boughs and spiraled inward like slow green comets." POV is stable and single, with dialogue (the voice) natural and goal-driven. Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "shimmered with a pale sheen," and propulsion advances story without obscuring clarity. Peak beats remain clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing folklore and transformation through specific details like the moonstone speck. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
