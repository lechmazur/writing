<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marla's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices, such as her unavoidable answer to the riddle, with embodied emotion ("her throat tightened") and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to conditionally wake the city is earned by prior causality, showcasing internal conflict between duty and wonder, with visible cost in her envious thought of liars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Marla's statement reweights the city's awakening with a cost—remembering astonishment—legible in the tower's flare and drone resurgence. The hybrid drive lens (causal and textural) holds from blackout to resolution, with orientation clear within 120 words and persistent constraint (her truthfulness) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "nectar dusk" and the lightning tower, which constrains the climax by forcing Marla's choice. The toll booth and bridge act as micro-settings that charge the final image, integrating environment into action and theme without ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal duty to city-wide awakening, driven by Marla's agency in answering the riddle under her truthful trait. Cost is unmistakable in her conditional statement and the resulting glow, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses other paths under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. routine emerges through images like the riddle and tower, with subtext in Granddad's lesson. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Marla's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing, and earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("tasted like nectar dusk") and perceptual signature filtering through Marla's bias. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping, supporting closure coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "drone beehives" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the riddle's reveal, and no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of truth curses, drone beehives, and lightning collection, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the hybrid structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor emotional truth.</comment>
