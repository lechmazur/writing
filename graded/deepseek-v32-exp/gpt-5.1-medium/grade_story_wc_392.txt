<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with clear motives rooted in professional conflict and personal integrity. The final choice to break free and report the truth is earned by the buildup of entangled memories and supervisor pressure, with visible cost in job risk. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as duty versus truth, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the protagonist's nod and apology, signaling a change in stance toward truth-telling, foreclosing compliance with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong, driven by lantern-induced memories and supervisor influence. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, like the "pinged" rails and "wet concrete walls," that pressure choices and charge the final image. The lantern functions as a micro-setting, constraining perception and catalyzing the climax, making it indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of truth versus job security escalate through the protagonist's agency, as memories and apparitions force a reckoning. Under the causal lens, escalation is driven by because/therefore linkages, culminating in a decision with unmistakable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory, truth, and control emerges organically from events and images, such as the lantern's "fingerprints in the light." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the protagonist's apology, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in phrases like "watchfully calm" and the rhythm under pressure. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "throat clearing itself," is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, maintaining propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of preventable death investigation, historical haunting, and ethical dilemma feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking with supernatural elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
