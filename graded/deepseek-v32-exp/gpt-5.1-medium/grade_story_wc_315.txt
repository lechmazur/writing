<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as anger flaring "bright as nearby lightning." The final choice to file the report is earned by prior causality and training, with visible cost in the burden carried. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "bearing the watcher's burden." Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory details and holding through closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is intact with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., seat sways, instruments respond to hands) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The parachute buckle and arbor function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from detecting static to unraveling a false promise. Cost is legible in hesitation and the weight of choice. Dominant stake (preserving trust) tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust and duty emerges through events and imagery, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, such as the "soundless echo" under ribs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet coherent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs, and syntax varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing watcher tropes with unique elements like the arbor and lightning scars. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
