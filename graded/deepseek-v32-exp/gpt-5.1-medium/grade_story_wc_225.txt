<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elior's characterization is deeply rooted in his guilt and exile, with embodied emotions like fidgeting with the pawn. His motivation to forgive himself is dramatized through on-page choices, and the final resolution feels earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain under the inferred Causal lens, with Elior's decoding actions directly leading to the closure. Orientation is established early, and the decisive change (time resuming) occurs on-page with felt cost. The tapestry's constraints shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like suspended raindrops and the platinum tower. The frozen village pressures Elior's choices, and the tapestry as a key object constrains actions and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (unfreezing the village) and escalate through Elior's agency under the Causal lens. Each decoding attempt narrows options with visible cost (tapestry darkening, bells trembling). The resolution is earned by his altered motives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and self-forgiveness emerges organically from Elior's struggle, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of time resuming, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflecting Elior's chess-tutor mindset. Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, and any elision (e.g., mayor's truncated speech) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes chess strategy with frozen time in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the woven tapestry. Emotional truth and risk-taking in structure heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
