<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma; interiority is embodied and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to share the glass is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the chest ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the shared glow reweights meaning, with cost legible in the "ache" and memory. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the grotto and sea glass constrain choices and charge the final image. Details are filtered through POV, integrating action and memory without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) escalates under accumulative lens through polishing and memory; agency drives deepening, with cost felt in the chest ache and foreclosed paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from images and events without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shared glow, reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, with propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized through specific details; emotional truth avoids templates. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
