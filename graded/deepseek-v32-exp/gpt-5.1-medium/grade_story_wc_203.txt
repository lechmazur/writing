<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., analyzing dust, engaging the mainspring). The final choice to engage is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost as the ceiling breaches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with strong linkage from call to breach. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost on-page (ceiling gives way to inverted room, reconfiguring reality). Persistent constraint of hidden realities shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., dust patterns, fluorescent buzz) filtered through POV. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, as the ceiling breach reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what ceilings hide) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency (analyzing dust, engaging mainspring). Cost is legible in the structural breach of reality, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reality as an agreement emerges through events and imagery (e.g., ceilings as thin treaties). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the breach, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (professional observation of dust, ghosts). Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure (e.g., "bulge pulsed"), and closure is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-seeing technician and cosmic horror in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risk-taking in the ceiling breach heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight with bold closure.</comment>
