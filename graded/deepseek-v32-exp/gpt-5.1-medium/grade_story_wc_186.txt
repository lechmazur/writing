<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his past, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His retrocognition and persistence drive the narrative, and the final release of his childhood message is earned through years of effort, foreclosing despair with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as the prism releases the message, rekindling Keeper's hope. The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, from retrocognition to comet alignment, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and broken prism constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "vibrating softly with radio ghosts" and "comet's pale roar" that reflect Keeper's POV and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled—proving meaning in coincidences—and escalate through Keeper's agency in tracking stars and seizing the comet opportunity. The cost of his endurance is legible in the message's release, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Keeper's quest, with the shard of hush and released message offering a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning in chaos. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, controlled syntax, and perceptual signature filtered through Keeper's retrocognition. Elevation diction fits the tone, and elision is purposeful, teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "dusk bleed through the cracks" is coherent and enhances pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic, mystical, and emotional elements uniquely, with the shard of hush and retrocognition transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
