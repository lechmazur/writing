<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's curiosity is consistently embodied through micro-choices like studying the hopscotch board and confronting Orvan, with the final risk-taking earned by prior diligence; interiority avoids stock phrasing, and the resolution forecloses safety with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens, with the corridor opening reconfiguring mapping concepts; cost is legible in Orvan's skepticism and the uncharted risk, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting that constrains Lio's choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "dust wavered along the lines" are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lio's agency under the accumulative lens, from idle observation to commanding the ship's course; stakes tighten with the risk of disaster, and cost is felt in Orvan's conditional approval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the hopscotch sequence and starling patterns, with the final image offering a non-literal answer to mapping the unseen; no moralizing, subtext operates in light imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic perceptual signatures like "animated ink correcting the mistakes of the sunset"; elision in pattern-noting is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language like "old librarian wandering shifting shelves" serving purpose; no loops or artifacts, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapping, light, and play feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure and conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry, grounded in specific details like the phrasebook.</comment>
