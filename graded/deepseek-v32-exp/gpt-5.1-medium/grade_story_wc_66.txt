<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a copyist, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., turning down the radio) revealing her values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her "secretly luminous" hope mirroring the dial glow. The boy's arrival introduces a secondary character without choreography issues, and Lina's endurance is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Lina and the boy lean into listening, with cost legible in their shared witness and hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and the broadcast's guidance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the ember alcove and mist pressuring choices (e.g., as a listening chamber) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "ash still drifted" and "dial glow," filtered through Lina's POV to reflect urgency and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching dust to prevent famine) escalates under the accumulative lens through the broadcast's instructions and the boy's arrival, showing the method works. Lina's agency drives the escalation, with cost legible in the risk of discovery and the shared hope at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images—memory, resistance, and hope—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shared listening, reweighting prior material like dust and music. Subtext operates in the broadcast's elusive lyrics and Lina's actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control (e.g., "thistled calm"). Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., the broadcast's content) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the boy's whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "ash still drifted from the old libraries, sifting down like gray snow." Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with clarity and momentum sustained to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis of post-famine resilience, music, and dust, with specific details making it inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is fully committed to, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
