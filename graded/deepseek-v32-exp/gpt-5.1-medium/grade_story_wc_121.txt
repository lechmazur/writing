<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and rooted in internal conflict, with contradictory impulses shown through the fractured timelines. His final choice to retrace paths is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as gravity returns. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lio emerges simplified, discarding the tablet; the accumulative/textural lens holds. Orientation is anchored early, and the hinge between drop and ripple charges the final image. The structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is vivid and selective, influencing mood and action with sensory detail. The tablet and environment constrain choices, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and details are filtered through Lio's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquering self) escalates through Lio's agency in retracing paths, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible as he loses floatation and futures extinguish. One meaningful deepening occurs with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrating possible lives emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the maze and tablet, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic prose is voice-motivated, and elision (e.g., timeline fractures) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of fractured timelines and procedural generation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
