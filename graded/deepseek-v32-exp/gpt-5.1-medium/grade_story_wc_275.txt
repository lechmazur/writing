<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives and contradictions; her pacifism clashes with her inheritance, embodied in micro-choices like repurposing tools. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her sheathed talent and transformed violence. Interiority is concrete and sensory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Mara walking among the roses, the engraved quiet breathing through her; cost is legible in the transformation of inheritance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and thematic density. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and structure coheres in a single POV scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the cracked dome and roses constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "smelled faintly of rust and faraway storms") are filtered through Mara's POV, and the micro-setting of the roses directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (weaving continuity through chaos) escalate under the Accumulative lens via density increases—encounters with hunters and raiders—driven by Mara's agency. Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of violence and the tangible influence of the roses on visitors, tightening the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like engraved values and repurposed tools, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of Mara among the roses, reweighting prior material without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmic, with a perceptual signature tied to Mara's senselessly perceptive calm. POV is stable and third-person, and diction remains within her lexicon. Experimental lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "tranquil blaze"), and sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly. Closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of pacifism, botany, and post-apocalyptic themes, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
