<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied, with trauma responses like flinches and heart stutters driving micro-choices; interior contradiction shown through simultaneous fear and agency; final choice to step into frame earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot coheres under causal lens with clear orientation by 120 words; closure lands as decisive change when protagonist enters frame, reconfiguring options with cost ("my pain began to factor"); persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is not just scenery but interface that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with environment pressuring decisions through light equations and humming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency under causal lens; choice to enter frame tightens options with unmistakable cost ("cold and familiar straps"); pressure coheres from initial disorientation to peak decision, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy and trauma emerges through events and images like the forest interface and frame; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice consistent under pressure, using patterned elision taught early; no head-hopping; diction reflects character's mind and trauma.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without muddle; rhythm varies naturally; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language coherent and purposeful, advancing story with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise fresh, combining trauma with sci-fi in non-obvious synthesis; tropes transformed through specific choices like proprioceptive enhancement; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
