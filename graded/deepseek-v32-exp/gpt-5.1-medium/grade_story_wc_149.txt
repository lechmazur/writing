<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure; micro-choices like accepting the bead and swearing the vow reveal a hierarchy of values. Lady Veil's motivation is clear and intensifies stakes, though her "lovingly venomous" trait could be more dramatized in action. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the greenhouse's response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the vow and the orchard's "solemn joy." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the bead's revelation tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the greenhouse's "glass ribs" and "endless night" filter through POV with sensory specificity. The orchard as a "covenant" actively pressures the protagonist's decisions, elevating it beyond atmosphere to narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency: the bead's introduction and the debt revelation deepen stakes, forcing the vow. Cost is legible in the "inexorable" rooting of terms and the greenhouse's stirred remembrance, narrowing options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of debt and transmutation emerge organically through particulars like the "resonant awakenings" and the bead's sigils. Ending offers a non-literal answer via the vow, reweighting prior material without moralizing; subtext in Lady Veil's "sorrowful and sharp" smile lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetically consistent, modulating under pressure. Dialogue (ghost's speech) is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., forgotten memories) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language ("veil smoked gently") serves atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the revelation, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost bride and alchemical orchard feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the "carved stone bead" and "resonant awakenings." Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is uniquely grounded.</comment>
