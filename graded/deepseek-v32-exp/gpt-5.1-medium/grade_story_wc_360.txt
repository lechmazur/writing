<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to understand emotion mathematics is clear and drives the story; Mara's borrowed personalities add depth. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "My chest tightened." Change is earned through the transposed empathy experience with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in "the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building sensory details to the climax. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the topaz workshop and halo fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "glowing like a buried sun" are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by narrator's agency in choosing a feeling and pressing the lever, leading to the immersive empathy experience. Cost is legible in the disorientation and reconfiguration of grief under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and empathy emerges through events and images, not statement. Subtext in Mara's borrowed personalities and the transposed empathy offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "the sky revised itself." Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., ambiguity) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language like "like a pond refusing to admit it was ice" is purposeful and clear, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of transposed empathy and mathematics of emotion is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with character-driven stakes. Risk-taking in structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
