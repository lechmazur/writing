<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses (practical disbelief vs. emotional urge) acting in scene. His final choice to engage with the letters is earned by prior causality, such as rearranging the stones and feeling the "luminescent ache," with visible cost in his trembling fingers and decision to write back.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Elias redefining his role from observer to participant. The cost is legible in the "fragile beacon" image, and the lens holds without contradiction, shaped by persistent constraints like the dark lighthouse and anonymous letters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices, such as Elias finding the letters and placing the sea glass. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "black water and white foam slicing around him," charging the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the discovery of letters that deepen the stake of protection. The cost is unmistakable in Elias's decision to write back, foreclosing his passive role and redefining options with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the stone messages and sea glass, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to protection and connection without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through Elias's unsigned letter, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Elias's "warmly observant" filtering of details like creaks and drafts. Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision (e.g., the letters' origins) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "a sharp, cold vacancy under his own skin," is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the climax in the lantern room.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse tropes through specific details like the fisherfolk code and letter chain. Risk-taking in the quiet, emotional resolution feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
