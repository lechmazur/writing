<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through curiosity and the satchel as a "second heart"; final choice to accept the vortex inheritance is earned by prior causality and visible cost in paying years, with micro-choices like tingling fingers and matched breathing under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from letter to decision; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the warmth rush and memory threading, reopening the atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the icebound atrium forces the central decision; recurring objects like the egg and acorn cap charge the final image; sensory details like "frosting the air" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake is signaled early (reopening the atrium); escalation is driven by protagonist's agency in feeling the vortex and deciding under Myra's pressure; cost is unmistakable in the agreement to pay years and feel stolen days.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time and preservation emerges through events and images like the acorn cap; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting borrowed time as seeds, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction; dialogue is natural and goal-driven; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the tidal breathing match.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "storm humming itself to sleep" is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed saving with time vortex feels inevitable; specific details like the acorn cap and risk-taking in surreal elements heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
