<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aurek's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his counter-clockwise nature, with micro-choices like reassembling the yoyo revealing his values. Interiority is concrete, such as feeling "some thin seam between fear and resolve" yield, and his final action is earned by prior causality. However, some emotional beats lean slightly abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with coherent linkages: Aurek's arrival, yoyo puzzle-solving, and hunger stone activation lead to closure. Orientation is anchored early, and the ending delivers a decisive change with cost in the "bleak exhilaration" and trembling lighthouse, under a consistent lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, like the lighthouse door requiring counter-clockwise turning and the hunger stone jutting from the crack. Sensory details (e.g., "basalt shining with a faint, latent radiance") are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (stepping beyond fate), and escalation is driven by Aurek's agency, such as solving the yoyo and casting it over the crack. The cost is legible in the "bleak exhilaration" and trembling, foreclosing options with felt price, though it lacks multiple beats of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of countering fate emerges through images and events, like the yoyo representing "the falling that returns," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lighthouse's response, but some subtext remains slightly elusive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm (e.g., "the sea withdraw like a held breath"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the builder's sketches) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "the slow exhale of low tide," and propulsion remains clear through peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of counter-clockwise time, hunger stone, and yoyo mechanism, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style and conceptual depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
