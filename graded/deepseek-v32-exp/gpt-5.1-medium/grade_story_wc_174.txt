<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in past failures, with interiority shown through embodied emotion ("ink dries fastest when people below are on fire"). The final choice to swap perspectives is earned by prior causality and conflicts, with visible cost in the stomach judgment. Lily and Marcus provide secondary pressure, but the narrator's flaws and micro-choices under pressure are consistently dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where stories orbit together, reconfiguring ethical storytelling with felt cost in the stomach judgment. The causal lens holds from argument to swap, with clear orientation early. The dome's role as a persistent constraint charges the final image, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dome setting constrains choices and charges the final image ("the retired radar dome listened"), with sensory details like "meteor hush" being selective and purposeful. Micro-setting elements (campfire stick) are integrated into action, and spatial choreography is coherent, supporting the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in ethical storytelling escalates through protagonist agency from argument to story swap, with cost legible in the stomach judgment. Pressure tightens under the causal lens, and the resolution forecloses paths with visible trade-offs, driven by character choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through stories orbiting, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through character conflicts and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic diction ("meteor hush"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentence-level craft supports the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dome as school, calligrapher, and puppet shows with non-obvious ingenuity. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors universals without derivative echoes.</comment>
