<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is vividly embodied through micro-choices like signing in pockets, and motivation to translate silence is clear and intensifies under pressure. The whispering advisor adds credible secondary pressure without overshadowing her agency. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws and contradictions are dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Lena's laugh harmonizes with silence, with felt cost in emotional release. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and structure builds through patterned density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harbor setting is luminous and specific, constraining choices at the breakwater edge and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV, with no generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes in translating silence escalate through Lena's signing and the advisor's guidance, driven by agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and ragged laugh, foreclosing prior isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and communication emerges naturally through images and actions, with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Lena's focus on silence and signs. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports momentum. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion enhances emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sign language, camera, and advisor offers a fresh take on internal conflict. Risk in accumulative structure pays off with heightened stakes and coherence, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
