<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His final choice to delve is earned by prior causality, though lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in the decision to enter the cave; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early and cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., cave mouth smell, lagoon mirroring internal state) and charging the final image with sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency with the compass and visions, tightening under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in his delving action, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in implication; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the hinged awakening concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is coherent and rhythmic, though no dialogue is present to test distinction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of petrichor collection and psychometry, with risk-taking in accumulative structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
