<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingertips still buzzing"), and his final choice to redirect the memory is earned by prior causality. Naya's affectionate skepticism provides crucial pressure, and their relationship forces micro-choices under stress, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Eli redirects the memory, altering his and others' paths with felt cost (buzzing settles). Causal lens holds strong from static shock to resolution, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio constrains choices and supplies resources, while the muscovite geode sliver charges the final image with fractally precise reflections. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Eli's sleep disruption) escalates through protagonist agency to a meaningful tightening where he redirects the memory, with cost legible in the settled buzz. Driven by causal linkages under the inferred lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring technology and memory through subtext and image (e.g., geode as fragile memory). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Eli, with distinct perceptual signature ("willowglass hope"). Voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy pill and static shock feels inevitable, with risk-taking in concept that heightens stakes. Turns are earned through character choice, and specificity avoids template plots.</comment>
