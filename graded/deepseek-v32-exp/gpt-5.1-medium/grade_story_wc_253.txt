<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The performer and Mara are richly characterized with embodied emotions and clear motivations. The performer's internal conflict between duty and rebellion is shown through micro-choices like whittling, and Mara's slight easing feels earned. Their relationship serves as a crucible, forcing a quiet but decisive change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the hush is carried like contraband, with cost legible in Mara's eased numbness. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with causality driven by the performer's actions. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the turbines' thudding and the wooden figure, which constrains choices and charges the final image. The farmhouse and turbines act as micro-setting that pressures the characters, integrating environment with internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the performer's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in emotional freedom versus state control. The whittling and narration deepen pressure, leading to a legible cost in Mara's easing and the risk of sedition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges organically from events and objects like the wooden hybrid, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, embracing complexity in grief and resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in the rich, dramatic narration. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and prose rhythm modulates with pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "slow comet" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes, and the emotional truth in grief feels inevitable and transformative.</comment>
