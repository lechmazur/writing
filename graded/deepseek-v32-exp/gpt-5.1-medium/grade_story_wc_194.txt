<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurel's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like pressing hands on the ledger. Interior contradiction is shown in his role as both executor and ghost custodian, and the final revelation is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via the queen's recorded voice, reweighting the dynasty's collapse with cost in the final image of "a tiny crest of possibility." Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with orientation anchored early. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the sepia reading room and gramophone charge the final revelation. Sensory details like "dust hung like mute constellations" are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the gramophone as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates under Accumulative lens through Aurel's agency with the gramophone, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of his understanding. No coincidental resolution; pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence ending dynasties emerges through subtext in the queen's words and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; epiphany is earned through concrete particulars like the standing waves concept. Emotional aftereffect lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, poetic prose. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., Mara's idea) is taught and paid off. Dialogue in the recorded voice is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "metal flower" is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story without momentum loss; clarity and concision are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of standing waves with historical collapse feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking with scientific concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative premises; closure is bold and coherent.</comment>
