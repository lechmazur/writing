<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing contradictory impulses. The final decision to go inland is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the renunciation of the sea-centric life. Lysa is less developed but serves as a sufficient crucible for the conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the decision to leave the coast. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the pause deepening through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly sensory and selective, filtering through the protagonist's POV to constrain choices and charge the final image. The tidal pool and stars are integrated into action and theme, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of the relationship decision escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in reflection and object use. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in the trade-off between sea and inland life. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically through particulars like the jade cicada and tidal pools, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in silence and imagery, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Lyrical prose is voice-motivated, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of tidal-pool chronicling with personal transition, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through grounded detail.</comment>
