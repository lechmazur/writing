<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's motivation for coherence is concretely dramatized through her actions and reflections, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to send the message is earned by prior causality, showing internal conflict between fear and resolve. The trait "awkwardly confident" constrains her movement, adding depth. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies weaken the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora sends the message, with cost legible in her trembling fingers and the stones' hum. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building through imagery and mood. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights options without exposition. Persistent constraints like the rebellion's lull shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the spaceport repair bay and stone circle pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cold deck plating" and "faintly vibrating deck" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's POV. The environment constrains her actions, such as using the opera glasses and standing barefoot. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the rebellion's lull, escalating through Liora's internal realization and decision to act, driven by agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her fear folding and the uncertainty of reigniting. One meaningful tightening occurs as she shifts from indecision to action, narrowing options. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in chaos emerges through particulars like the opera glasses and stone circle, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her message, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images and implications, such as "sparks" failing and catching. Emotional aftereffect lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulations, like "thunderous serenity," are consistent and purpose-driven. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Internal thought formatting is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "cathedral arches," is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, but no clarity loss at closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural acceleration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spaceport, stones, and rebellion feels organic and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise offers a fresh angle on rebellion, anchored in Liora's peculiar perspective. No derivative echoes or hedging.</comment>
