<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to discover what trees witness is clear and drives the narrative; his interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as taking the sextant despite protocol. The final choice to record the trees' sorrow is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ledger entry, showing a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure is achieved through a conceptual repricing where Milo's recording reweights sorrow toward forgiveness, with cost legible in the final image. The structure is coherent, with the pin drop as inciting incident and orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral to choices, such as the stormlit tower influencing mood and the sextant healing in moonlight. The labyrinth and rooftop garden act as micro-settings that constrain and enable actions, charging the final image with atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Milo's quest to understand trees, escalating under accumulative lens through the sextant's discovery and use, which deepens knowledge and narrows options. Agency is clear in his decision to use the sextant, with cost felt in the dawn recording that forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quantified sorrow and forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like the sextant's history and trees' memories, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of sorrow bending toward forgiveness, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Milo, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature that reflects his role; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, such as in the description of the labyrinth inhaling. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language, like "the tower sounded hollow, like a seashell," is consistent and purposeful, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow and labyrinth maintenance, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specific details like the sextant's transformation avoid template plots.</comment>
