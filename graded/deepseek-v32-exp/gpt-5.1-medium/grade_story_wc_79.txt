<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keth's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, driving his actions consistently. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "the pull sat in his chest like a grain of sand." His final choice to blow the whistle is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in risking change. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with the turtles turning, a decisive change under the causal lens, cost legible in the risk undertaken. Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The ending reconfigures options with felt pressure, satisfying the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the city on turtles and rusted gate pressuring choices. Sensory details like "salt light glazed the roofs" are selective and purposeful. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image, as the shells' patterns drive the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Keth's agency under the causal lens, from investigating shells to blowing the whistle. Dominant stake of survival tightens through his choices, with cost visible in the final act. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like guilt and duty, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as the turtles turn, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in silence and implication, such as the silent watchers, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Keth, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose like "barnacled continents sighing." Voice modulates under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "dread kept spinning its own shell." Sentence-level propulsion advances story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, with city on turtles and spiral-shell cartographer. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
