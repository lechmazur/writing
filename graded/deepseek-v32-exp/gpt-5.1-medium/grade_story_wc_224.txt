<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "ache behind my ribs"), and the final choice to speak the buried language is earned with visible cost (cracking open sealed rooms). Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (language redefining home), under an accumulative/textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of buried language shapes the final image. Cost is legible in the final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (lanterns with stained pages) that constrain choices (moving map, reordering aisles). The lost language stone as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency (seeking the stone, deciding to speak), with cost unmistakable in the climax (cracking open sealed rooms). Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (stone, thunder), with subtext in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the realization about language and home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, reflective); voice remains consistent under pressure, and dialogue with the seer is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "books fluttering like uneasy birds") and clear in peak beats, maintaining momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (bookstore as absences in stone, lost language stone), with emotional truth in family dialect. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
