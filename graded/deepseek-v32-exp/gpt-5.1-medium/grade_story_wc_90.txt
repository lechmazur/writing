<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's pacifism and emotional gravity shifts are deeply integrated into choices and stakes, with embodied contradictions during memory immersions. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a decisive change where the dimension yields—cost is legible in the "slow, aching sound" and weightless surge. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of memory access tightens coherently toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and Kwan Yin's Tear function as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., weight changes affecting ship stability) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking the dimension) escalates through protagonist agency in metabolizing memories, with cost visible in weight shifts that alter ship navigation. One meaningful tightening occurs as joy and sorrow directly enable progress under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shadow work and compassion, resisting moralizing; the final image of planting trees reweights prior suffering with hope without stating a thesis. Subtext operates through implication in gestures and memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet precise, reflecting the caretaker's role. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure, and any elision (e.g., memory mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("sighed each time it completed another orbit") serves momentum and clarity, even in peak beats like the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes shadow work, quantum memory, and post-human pacifism into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in structure (memory immersions) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels earned through specifics.</comment>
