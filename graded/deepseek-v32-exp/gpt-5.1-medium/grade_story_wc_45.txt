<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and forgiveness are consistently embodied, driving her investigation and final choice to rescue the boy. Internal conflict between doubt and yearning is dramatized in scene, and her bone-setting expertise culminates in the climactic realignment. The final step through the doorway is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara rescues the boy and the substitute body crumbles, reconfiguring doubt with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the garden and tooth shaping tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with selective sensory details like "glass instruments hummed with borrowed starlight." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from doubting the body to discovering the tooth and rescuing the boy. The dominant stake of certainty versus doubt tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the doorway step and bone realignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the changeling's tooth and Tomas's plan, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to doubt and forgiveness without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication in images and gestures, such as the crumbling body.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains coherent through peaks, and purposeful elision (e.g., the doorway) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated, as in "doubt felt almost bearable," and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm and emphasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes fantasy and literary elements with originality, transforming changeling tropes through specific character choices and setting. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
