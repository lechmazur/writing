<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent reflective traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like studying reflection angles. Micro-choices, such as adding a mirror instead of replacing the spring, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of direct looking in favor of peripheral vision is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the restored timer crowds the silence with echoes, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of light and sound building cohesively. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is intact, driven by the locksmith's agency. The final image of the "softly luminous" silence charges the ending with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the marble cavern and timer constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "moist air" and "mineral veins" are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment actively shapes tactics, such as using mirrors for sound reflection. The cavern's resonance in the climax reweights the stake with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the locksmith's agency under the Accumulative lens, from studying reflections to realizing the timer's purpose, deepening the stake of storing wonder. Pressure coheres and tightens through a meaningful turn when he understands the "wounded season" is time itself. Cost is legible in the effort to restore echoes and the emotional weight of forgotten moments. The resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring memory, wonder, and time through concrete particulars like the timer and echoes. Subtext operates in implication, such as the timer as a "wounded bird." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the crowded silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the locksmith's peripheral focus. Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic syntax that heightens pressure, e.g., "gears clicked weakly, teeth skipping like a stuttered sentence." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "teeth skipping like a stuttered sentence," and does not muddle peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained throughout. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar concepts like time and memory with a fresh, non-obvious angle through the harvest of echoes and reverse-engineering. Tropes are transformed via specific choices, such as the locksmith's trade and the cavern setting. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
