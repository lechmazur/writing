<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in family tradition, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as stepping to the compass edge. Interiority is concrete, and his final renunciation of fixed north is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting distortion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where Elian redefines true north, with cost felt in his acceptance of temporal uncertainty; the time dilation scar persistently shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the compass rose and time dilation deck constraining choices and charging the finale. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "recycled dust" and starfield distortion, mirroring internal states without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's agency in sketching the warped stars, under accumulative lens; cost is legible in his renunciation of fixed constellations, narrowing options and deepening thematic weight without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of true north as direction emerges through particulars like sketching and dilation, with a non-literal, resonant answer at closure that reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic rhythm, and controlled elision; voice remains coherent under pressure, and minimal dialogue serves subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent, and momentum supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation and personal ritual transforms tropes through specific details; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
