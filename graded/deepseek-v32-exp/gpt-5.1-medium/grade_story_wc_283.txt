<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her disillusionment with the Council's ordered obedience. Interiority is concrete, such as feeling the cliffs' hum in memory, and her final choice to release the echo is earned through prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through action and perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as the echo spills, redefining shared wisdom with "endless raw possibility." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and pattern. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the cliffs' silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "dust floated like slow constellations" filtering through Mara's POV. The amber warehouse and button mapping constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting elements (buttons, jar) alter tactics and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shared wisdom vs. order escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in Mara's agency. Her decision to release the echo forecloses the Council's path with cost legible in the "unearthed silence" and reweighted possibilities. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as the echo's tangled voices contrasting with linear prophecy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own," without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "buttons hummed their quiet geometry." Voice is poetic and controlled, modulating with pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the button mapping is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "slow constellations," enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo, prophecy, and shared wisdom feels inevitable, with specific details like button cataloging transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure reweights prior material with ingenuity.</comment>
