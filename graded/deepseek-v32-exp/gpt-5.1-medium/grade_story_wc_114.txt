<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and contradictory impulses under pressure, such as her shivering skin and paced certainty. Her motivation to find the "weight of a swallowed truth" drives the narrative, and her final renunciation is earned through prior causality with visible cost. The oracle's fault-tolerant nature adds secondary pressure, enriching the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence under a Hybrid lens (accumulative textural with causal links) is strong; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as the truth "settled low in her chest." Causality is tight, from Mara's fevered confession to the oracle's retention, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the weather station and Feverwhisper illustration constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "green auroral sorrow" and "rime crusted the railings" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under the Hybrid lens through Mara's agency, from hypothesis revelation to the realization the valley was targeted, narrowing options with legible cost. The dominant stake (truth about storms) tightens meaningfully, and the final admission forecloses a path with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the Feverwhisper extinction and oracle's fault tolerance, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth and complicity without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, such as the oracle's cool reply deepening the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable in Mara's POV, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with the oracle is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext that advances plot without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "swaying certainties" is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally to support atmosphere and momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of the fault-tolerant oracle and swallowed truth concept, transforming tropes with specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
