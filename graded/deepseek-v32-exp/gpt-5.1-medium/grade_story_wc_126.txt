<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elio's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as his playing style that refuses resolution. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, rooted in his backstory and acoustic perception, with visible cost in leaving the mendicant's bowl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Elio's shift from asking to listening, reinforced by the upside-down bowl. The Accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and resonance, with orientation clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "glass ribs" and "bruised light" filtered through Elio's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elio's agency under the Accumulative lens, from playing for coins to his decision with Mara, with cost legible in his emptied bowl. The dominant stake of finding beauty tightens through a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges through particulars like Elio's unbinding notes and the saplings' growth, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in rhythmic control and selective attention to echoes. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "chronic hush fattens," is coherent and purposeful, supporting clarity and propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic, musical, and ecological elements, with risk-taking in lyrical style. The premise feels inevitable and transforms familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
