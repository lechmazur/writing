<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like hovering over the SUB BASS knob. Her final interference feels earned by prior causality, though the cost is more implied than visceral, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the Void's response steadies Mara, reconfiguring the dynamic under the causal lens. Causality is strong, but the cost is subtle, anchored in the rattling glass and breathing rather than explicit consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the transmitter tower and radio equipment enable Mara's broadcast, charging the final image with the window glass rattling. Sensory details like "subsonic insistence she felt in her teeth" are purposefully filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, as her decision to interfere tightens stakes and invites the Void's response. The cost is legible in the risk taken, though it remains more conceptual than sharply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the Void mirroring human power plays, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the steadying response. Subtext operates in the signal's changes and Mara's manifesto-like broadcast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature like "sky thinking aloud" that remains consistent under pressure. Experimental elements like subsonic frequency descriptions are taught and legible, enhancing the ethereal tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density, such as "compressing the waveform like a held breath," and rhythmic control. Minor figurative stacking in peaks prevents a higher score, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signals with campus politics feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical premise heightening stakes. Specific details like the astronomical charts and subsonic methods avoid template plots, supporting a singular artistic stance.</comment>
