<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete actions like decoding the logbook and testing distances. The final renunciation of crossing the threshold is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "sacred ache" line. Interiority is embodied and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the protagonist accepts the necessary distance, with cost legible in "feeling the sacred ache." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of imagery and concepts. Orientation is clear early with the terrace and maze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the drifting terrace and corn maze directly pressure the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "cornfields looked like fingerprints" and "air thickened" during distance tests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, such as decoding the logbook and testing distances, leading to the tilt into the maze. Cost is unmistakable in the room tilt and the final uncrossed step, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the final threshold offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the father tapping wood and the protagonist's stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in poetic observations like "cornfields looked like fingerprints." Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "fractured hush" and "peeling myself out like a husk," enhancing clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements like the butterfly effect and prism terrace into an organic whole, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes. The concept of necessary distances feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
