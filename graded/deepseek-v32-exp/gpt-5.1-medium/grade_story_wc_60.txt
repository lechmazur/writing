<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is consistently embodied through micro-choices like reaching into the fountain, and her final renunciation of skepticism is earned with visible cost ("painfully luminous from the inside out"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, aligning with her realistically imaginative trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Lira's loss of doubt and the city's renewal) under a causal lens, cost is legible in her "painfully luminous" state, and the stained glass box's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., the fountain's suspended water forces Lira's action) and charges the final image with the city "breathing through its fountains." Sensory details like "fingers burning with the cold" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from following anomalies to shattering the box, with cost unmistakable in her forfeiture of skepticism. Stakes tighten meaningfully through each beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events (e.g., the box shattering reweights memory and doubt) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "hopeful silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature filtered through Lira's skepticism ("doubts shone brighter"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "water rose straight up, then halted in midair."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "constellations learning to walk") is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats like the box shattering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory and magic, transformed through specific details like the stained glass box; risk-taking in poetic diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
