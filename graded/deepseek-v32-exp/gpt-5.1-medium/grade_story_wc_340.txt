<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Etta's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like clutching the key and using goggles. Her internal conflict between stated and true reasons drives the narrative, and the final change—carrying the diary's method—is earned through prior causality, with cost in her reconfigured perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Etta's new lens for reading suffering, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the goggles and diary constraining tactics and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like frost and light filtering through POV. The icebound spire and observatory door pressure choices, and the goggles function as micro-setting that charges the closure by enabling the diary's decryption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, and escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Etta's agency in using the goggles and interacting with the door. Cost is legible in the conceptual shift at closure, though it lacks a tangible price, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Etta's journey and the diary's revelations, with subtext in gestures like murmuring apologies to the door. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to seeking joy beneath anguish without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Etta's curiosity. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in the diary's encryption is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though slightly purple in peaks, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes familiar elements with fresh specificity, transforming the trope through Etta's emotional journey. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
