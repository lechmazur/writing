<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with contradictory impulses (control vs. envy of plants) acting simultaneously in scene. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, such as the lightning-struck tree and her circuitous detours, with visible cost in the "fear that tasted like iron." Micro-choices like pocketing the linden leaf reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through imagery and reflection to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands with cost in Mara's kneeling and the "sustaining transformation," foreclosing her path of rigid control. The linden tree's burning and the trellis's attention create a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the nursery, trellis, and storm season pressuring choices and charging the final image. The linden leaf and mossy trellis function as micro-settings that constrain Mara's actions and mirror her internal state. Sensory details like "water still jeweled the wire" are filtered through her POV and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of control vs. change escalates under the accumulative lens through the storm's unscheduled arrivals and the tree's burning, deepening Mara's knowledge and narrowing her options. Agency in her decision to kneel and surrender drives the escalation, with cost legible in her fear and the "reluctant metamorphosis." No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of releasing control emerges organically through particulars like the linden leaf's reconstruction and the trellis's attention, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "sustaining transformation," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and gestures, such as the leaf's heat and the green hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's professional yet poetic noticing. Voice modulates with pressure, using compressed diction in peaks like "kneeled in the mud" without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in reflection is taught and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "ghost of sky") does not harm closure or cause muddle. No loops or scaffold artifacts; syntax varies naturally with the emotional rhythm. Closure image remains sharp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of internal metamorphosis with horticultural detail, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, avoiding template plots.</comment>
