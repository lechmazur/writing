<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with concrete interiority. The final choice to redirect the signal is earned by prior causality, showing agency under pressure. However, emotional depth lacks intense internal contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the interpreter redirects the signal, promising transformation with visible cost (risk of harm versus unsatisfied echo). Orientation is clear early, and the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "creaking softly" and "slick with moonlight" that constrain choices and charge the final image. The radio tower city actively pressures the protagonist's actions and deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from detection to understanding the tower's wish, driven by protagonist agency in using tools and making a compromise. Cost is legible in the risk of collapse versus eternal echo, aligning with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the tower's rehearsed disappearance. The ending offers a non-literal answer through redirection, avoiding moralizing while resonating deeply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "moon swelled like a silver lantern." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., discarding assumptions) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and advances story, e.g., "towers began to speak in thin multitudes," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized organically, with tools like the shard of hush transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
