<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and rooted in internal conflict between duty and family, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His final choice to return is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his sob. Micro-choices under pressure, such as laying his hand over the child's outline, reveal his values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Lysander turns back, reconfiguring his priorities with felt cost ("sob that hurt like swallowing glass"). Accumulative drive lens holds through imagery and emotional depth. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of lost time shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the midnight glade and clouds constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "midnight pooled in the grass like ink" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment pressures Lysander's realization and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of lost time and family is signaled early and escalates through the card readings, driven by Lysander's agency. Cost is legible in his realization and decision to return. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lost time and repentance emerges through particulars like the cards and mementos, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lysander's turn back, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, e.g., "sea of clouds shone faintly." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "clouds below surged upward like a tide of luminous ash." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy, lost time, and cloudbound repentance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the onyx-ink deck and family custom create freshness.</comment>
