Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the woman's decision to expose the truth reweights the premise with cost, seen in her frozen tears and the glacier's creak. The causal lens holds tightly from Marek's past to the dream interpretation, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine constrains choices by isolating the dream analysis, and the melted snow globe charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Sensory details like "candlelight trembled like uncertain stars" are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marek's agency in interpreting dreams, leading to the woman's realization and decision to expose the truth. The cost is legible in her tears and the implied familial guilt, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges through concrete images like the snow globe and dreams, not direct statement.

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream analysis, wreck-diving, and corporate negligence feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.
