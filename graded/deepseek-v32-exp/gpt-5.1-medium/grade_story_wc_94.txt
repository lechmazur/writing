<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation rooted in past censorship and desire to understand scars; interiority concrete with embodied emotion like "old absence stir in his throat"; micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to look through telescope, reveal hierarchy of values; final choice earned by causality with visible cost in rarefied air.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is Conceptual Repricing with poet's realization reweighting prior imagery; orientation clear by ~120 words; cost legible in "air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth"; persistent constraint of storm and timer shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful, with stormlit observatory constraining choice via timer and dome; sensory detail selective and POV-filtered, like "smelled of dust, hot metal"; environment charges final image of auroral wounds; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding censorship scars escalates under accumulative lens through dialogue and timer; poet's agency in looking through telescope deepens knowledge with cost in grief and wonder; one meaningful tightening forecloses option of ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silenced voices emerges through events and images like "cartography of scars"; subtext in dialogue and final image offers resonant answer without moralizing; earned wisdom from concrete particulars, e.g., poet's banned verses spiking detectors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice poetic and rhythmic under pressure, e.g., "wind read its own unruly poem"; dialogue natural and goal-driven with subtext; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats like "storm-kissed wonder" does not harm clarity; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise fresh with non-obvious synthesis of censorship and celestial phenomena; tropes transformed through specific details like auroral wounds; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
