<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's prosopagnosia and motivation to preserve her art are deeply integrated, with embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., memorizing the grain, painting the book). The final renunciation—accepting limits as frames—is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the compression of the sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via Mara's realization that "some limits were not failures but frames," reweighting her art and condition with undeniable cost. The Accumulative lens holds, with pattern taught early and orientation clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tree trunk library constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (dust motes, engines ticking) filtered through Mara's POV. The coin and book safe function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as the countdown horns tighten pressure and her choice to paint the book forecloses options with visible cost in the compressed sky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—Mara's face blindness, the compressed sky—offering a resonant, non-literal answer on limits without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Mara's focus on light over faces). Poetic syntax and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the painting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face blindness and magical realism with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in quiet tone pays off with inevitable closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
