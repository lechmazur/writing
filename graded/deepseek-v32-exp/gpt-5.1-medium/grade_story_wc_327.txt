<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation to translate texture into sound is clear and consistent, driving his choices. His interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like tracing copper veins and using the diamond. The final choice to merge with the echoes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his voice being braided into the canyon's language. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his acceptance of the diamond's curse, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as the storyteller sings a new language into being, with cost legible in the braiding of his voice and the shedding of bone dust. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory details and patterns. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure from arrival to tunnel action coheres without causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the dying language shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the towers of bone and tunnel of echoes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the walls pulsing with syllables and the diamond catching darkness. The environment directly influences the protagonist's decisions, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as he actively uses the diamond and his voice to engage with the echoes. The dominant stake of preserving the dying language tightens through a meaningful deepening, with cost visible in the merging and bone dust shedding. No coincidence resolves the conflict; instead, his choices narrow options and reconfigure meaning. The cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the flawed diamond and echoes, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the creation of a new language, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, like the curse showing truth too clearly. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature that reflects the storyteller's articulate and poetic mind. Voice is consistent, modulated under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping; diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, enhancing rhythm. The prose's texture aligns with character, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; syntax propels the narrative smoothly. Read-aloud test passes, and closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements uniquely, with a fresh angle on language preservation through specific details like the copper veins and flawed diamond. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes is grounded in character and world logic. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, showcasing conceptual integrity.</comment>
