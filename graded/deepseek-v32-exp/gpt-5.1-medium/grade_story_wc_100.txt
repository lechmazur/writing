<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and stubborn duty are concretely embodied through micro-choices like rowing out alone; his final realization that he "revitalizes what the world thinks finished" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the paused stillness. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias steps into the library, reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost in the "chased stillness finally paused." The Hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., "sea opened like an eye") charge the final image; the underwater library constrains choice and tactics, with environment shaping the climax. Specificity is filtered through POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Hybrid lens is driven by Elias's agency—rowing out and engaging with the librarian—tightening the stake of "giving rest a permanent address" with cost legible in his acceptance of a new duty. Pressure coheres without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest and revitalization emerges organically from events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose and purposeful elision. Dialogue (brief) carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker mythos with surreal underwater library feels inevitable; risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise offers a fresh angle on familiar themes.</comment>
