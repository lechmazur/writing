<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Laleh's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives; her steel arms and gentle radicalism are embodied in micro-choices, such as cradling empathy and renaming the fire, earning the final hinge moment with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing. The only minor slip is a slight over-reliance on thematic labels like "gentle radical" in narration, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing as the city's tension uncoils, driven by Laleh's agency under an accumulative/textural lens. The retrocognitive trapping and tessera use create coherent causality, with cost legible in the softened air and people stepping into mercy. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic stepping stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "iron and rain" and "hollow spine" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Laleh's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as using the stepping stone patterns to guide her renaming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Laleh's agency under the accumulative lens, from using the tessera to renaming, which tightens stakes and forecloses options with cost seen in the altered atmosphere. The dominant stake of freeing the city from retrocognitive trapping deepens through her actions, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as steel arms cradling empathy and renaming as invitation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the tessera blazing, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm and controlled compression, such as "warm coldness" and "double exposure," under pressure. POV is stable and single, with elision taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within Laleh's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "flickering through the present like double exposure" is coherent and purposeful. No scaffolding or redundancy; closure image remains sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of retrocognitive trapping, aberrant mercy, and renaming, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept is fully committed to, with specific details like the tessera and steel arms avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
