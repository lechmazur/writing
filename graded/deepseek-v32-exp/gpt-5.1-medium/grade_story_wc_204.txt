<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ilen's motive to compress eternity is clear and drives the plot, with micro-choices like uncorking the whisper under pressure. However, interiority lacks deep embodied emotion, and contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as treaties rewrite and reality negotiates, under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from frost patterns to the final page, with the whisper key shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass orchard library constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. The setting's instability pressures Ilen's experiments, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ilen's agency under the Hybrid lens, from the frost deadline to uncorking the whisper, with cost legible in the library's shudder. However, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of eternity and reality negotiation emerges through events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via folded timelines. Subtext in frost patterns and whisper avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue from librarians is natural and goal-driven. However, minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in climax, supporting clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original with a fresh synthesis of concepts, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration of elements feels inevitable and transformative.</comment>
