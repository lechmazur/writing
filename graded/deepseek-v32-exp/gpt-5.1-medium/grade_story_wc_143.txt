<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ilya's contradictory impulses (duty vs. preservation) are embodied in micro-choices like pressing his glove into the dust and using the amber vial, with final renunciation earned by prior causality and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the unused red vial and amber glow; accumulative/textural lens holds, and the time constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., harvesters' lights, crater rim) and charges the final image; sensory details like "glassy pan of basalt" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Ilya's agency (photographing, using vials), narrowing options with cost legible in the foreclosed path of saving the grain; dominant stake of preservation vs. progress tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transience emerges through particulars like the grain and vials, with ending offering a non-literal answer via the amber glow that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic diction reflects Ilya's state, and any elision (e.g., daughter's off-page presence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "stranded iceberg" is coherent, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi tropes through specific details (grain N-0, vials) and emotional specificity; risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
