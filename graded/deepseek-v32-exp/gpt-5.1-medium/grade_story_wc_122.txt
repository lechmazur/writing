<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and drives the plot; her deafness is integral, not ornamental. Students like Jorin show embodied emotional shifts under pressure, with contradictions (laughter then sobs) earned in scene. The final choice to use the filament is rooted in prior causality, and cost is visible in students' tears and thinning numbness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (silence becoming music) with felt cost on-page (tears, laughter). Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density. Orientation is clear early—Eira in the drum maker's cavern with students—and the filament mechanism leads coherently to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constrains choice: the cavern and drums pressure the action, charging the final image. Sensory details (dust, muted light) are selective and POV-filtered. The drums as micro-setting alter tactics and are indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional numbness) escalates under accumulative lens through Eira's agency with the filament. Cost is legible in students' emotional releases (e.g., Jorin sobbing). One meaningful tightening—the drums awakening—reweights options and forecloses numbness with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, not statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer (silence as music) that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures (hands on drums) and implication, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Eira, with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "audibly muted light"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure; elision (e.g., filament mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sleeping heart" drums) is coherent and purposeful. No register drift or artifacts in peak beats; closure image is clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative: deaf teacher using silence as music synthesizes familiar tropes with specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable, with originality rooted in character and setting.</comment>
