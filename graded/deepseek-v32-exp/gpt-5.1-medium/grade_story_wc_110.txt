<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The registrar's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to investigate the tickets and later approach the hooded figure is rooted in consistent traits of curiosity and isolation, intensifying to compel higher-stakes choices. The final choice to break her silence is earned by prior causality with visible cost (heart pounding, shared intention).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkages; closure is a decisive change (approach and shared silence) that reconfigures options with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The ending image legibly shows cost through "heart pounding" and "mistrust cracked."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystal whispering forecourt and archives constraining choices (e.g., using the lens, attending the concert). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The environment pressures tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection vs. mistrust escalates through protagonist agency (investigating tickets, using lens, attending concert). Pressure tightens under the causal lens, with a meaningful turn when she decides to approach the figure, and cost is legible in her emotional risk and the shared moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communication and trust emerges through events and images (doodles, silence, lens) without direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shared paper and silence, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., cryptic doodles) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion advances story clearly, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of contraband memories, silent communication, and cryptic art. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
