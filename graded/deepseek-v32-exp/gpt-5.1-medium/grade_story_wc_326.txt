<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority like heartbeat counting. Micro-choices under pressure, such as spilling tea and frantic coding, reveal values and drive the narrative. Final choice to embrace nonlinear reconstruction is earned by prior causality and embodied cost of past failures. No slips touching closure; emotional progression is realistic and contradictory impulses are dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Lian's voice emerging and the realization they are writing her future, costing the protagonist's acceptance of his failures. Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building via patterns like heartbeats and ink. Orientation is clear early, and the ink pattern insight provides a meaningful turn. Persistent constraints (digital ghost, heartbeat counting) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the creaking observatory and freezing snowflakes that reflect POV bias. Micro-setting elements (porcelain shard, ink spill) constrain choices and charge the final image by triggering the protagonist's insight. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action without stalling momentum. Environment actively pressures decisions and supports the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting Lian escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases (deadline, ink spill, static) and a pattern break. Protagonist's agency in changing his coding approach based on the ink pattern drives a meaningful tightening that forecloses linear methods. Cost is legible in his acceptance of past failures and the transformed relationship. Escalation is coherent and reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief, nonlinear resurrection, and learning from failure emerges organically through events and images like the porcelain shard and ink patterns. Subtext operates in gestures and implication, avoiding direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Earned through specific struggle and concrete particulars, with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, introspective voice reflected in diction like "checksum scars" and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific and selective. Lian's dialogue at the end feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot. No head-hopping; purposeful elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, or atmosphere seamlessly. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. No artifacts like paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise of digital ghost resurrection with death certificate error offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like heartbeat counting and ink patterns. Risk-taking in nonlinear narrative and poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and closure commits fully to the premise.</comment>
