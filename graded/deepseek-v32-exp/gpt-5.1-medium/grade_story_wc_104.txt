<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and strategic micro-choices. Her final guidance of the Overseer is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mara guides the Overseer away from ruin, reconfiguring options under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (e.g., piano bench, arrow) and charging the final image with vivid sensory details like "popcorn oil and cheap plastic."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with the seed vault, escalation is driven by Mara's agency to impede, and cost is legible in the risk of explosion, tightening under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and resilience emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in Mara's actions. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic yet controlled diction and rhythmic precision under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion without artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "chain-links rasping like reluctant applause," and clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes with specific details like the seed vault in a carnival; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
