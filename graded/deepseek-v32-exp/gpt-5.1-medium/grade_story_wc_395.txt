<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying as pressure rises. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing 713 and spoofing the audit. The final choice to follow 713 is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the discovery of the hidden subnet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, from noticing 713 to discovering the hidden subnet. Closure is a decisive change on-page, reconfiguring knowledge with felt cost in the final image of "who chooses to stay." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, such as "humming cathedral of obsolete lives," and pressures choices throughout. The patch object constrains a choice and charges the final image, while the archive's environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding truth escalates under the causal lens through protagonist agency, such as tracing 713 and querying silence. Cost is legible in the risk taken to access Deep Cold and the emotional weight of the discovery, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the patch and hidden subnet, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of deletion and escape, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "choir forced to sing commercial jingles," and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of corporate dystopia and mystery, transformed through specific details like the 713 pattern and patch. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
