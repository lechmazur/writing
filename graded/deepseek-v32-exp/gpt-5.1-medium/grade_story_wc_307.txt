<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's backwards aging and Mora's anticipation are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., Mora's trembling and gaze softening). The final renunciation—Mora's realization of what can be lost—is earned by the trance experience, with visible cost in her "painful and bright" return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mora feels the "shape of a self that might choose not to return," with cost legible in the memory rush. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the grotto's resonance and ring patterns, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: the magnetic grotto hums, aligning ripples, and the floating platform sways, charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "water drawn upward," "sycamore hush") are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning vanishing) escalates under accumulative lens through the stone-drop trance, driven by Mora's agency in obeying Elian. Cost is unmistakable in her moment of erasure and return, foreclosing options with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the lesson on withholding and vanishing, with subtext in Elian's refusal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"decide what deserves to remain"—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited (Mora's perspective), with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Elian's "I withhold" explanation), and elision (e.g., trance duration) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "silence lengthened into shape") is consistent and purposeful, and closure image remains clear despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes backwards aging and vanishing teaching with non-obvious depth, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
