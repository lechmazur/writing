<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear and consistent, driving choices like visiting the shed and interacting with Mara. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "gaze at its stained panels until colors pulsed like slow bees." Final renunciation to keep the box as witness is earned with visible cost in the dense hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the covenant shifts to between silence and meaning, with cost legible in "the grain of unsaid things." Accumulative lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with apiary and ghosts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the stained glass box and apiary pressure the narrator's actions. Sensory details like "wind hissed through warped frames" are selective and purposeful. Micro-setting of the shed functions as a crucible for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the covenant escalates under accumulative lens through Mara's appearance and the box's revelation. Agency in opening the box and accepting the task forecloses options with cost in "the task was mine alone." One meaningful tightening deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and meaning emerges through particulars like the covenant scroll and Mara's gestures, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the true covenant: between silence and meaning." Subtext operates in implication and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "read their intentions not from their mouths but through contextual clues." Rhythmic control under pressure, like "a hush so dense I could almost feel its grain." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "Light bent strangely through her, as if the covenant were a lens." No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghosts, covenant, and beekeeping feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet climax. Specific details like the stained glass box transform tropes through character and stakes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
