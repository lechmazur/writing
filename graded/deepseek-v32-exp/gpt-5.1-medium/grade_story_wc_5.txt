<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in slow, deliberate actions. However, lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses, which limits depth. The final endurance is earned but feels somewhat one-note for high literary standards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the map is completed and accepted, with cost legible in the world's fading heartbeat. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of the dying world shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard and crater pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the "thin, colorless ribs" of snow and the "frozen geometry" of trees.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the alchemist's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in preserving the world's heartbeat deepening through map creation. Cost is visible in the planetary pulse fading, and one meaningful tightening occurs as the map coalesces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like starlight vials and heartbeats, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's sufficiency, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose like "exhausted metronomes." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "grind time itself into powder," and propulsion is maintained without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of alchemy, cartography, and ecological mourning. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
