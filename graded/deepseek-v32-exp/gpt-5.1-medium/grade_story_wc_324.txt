<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eren's persistent curiosity is concretely embodied in micro-choices like brushing the photograph and deciding to call Deniz, compelling higher-stakes actions under pressure. His internal conflict between protocol and personal mission is shown simultaneously in scene, not summarized, with emotions filtered through specific perceptions (e.g., "the room tilt, not physically but in meaning"). The final renunciation of protocol to deliver the message is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the woman's cry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "a woman began to cry, sound thin as tracing paper, yet louder than the whole mist-wrapped city." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterned details (hearing aid pulses, photograph) to reconfigure meaning. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words with "mist-clad atrium at twilight," and the single-POV, two-shard structure (atrium to apartment) maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices: the hearing aid "twitched whenever an unsent message searched for a receiver" constrains Eren's investigation, and the photograph charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "mist smeared the glass roof, turning streetlights into slow, underwater lanterns"). The apartment's "boiled cabbage and laundry soap" odor reflects character survival, not generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Eren's agency: his curiosity narrows options from logging the death to actively calling Deniz, with cost legible in the emotional weight of the delivered message. The dominant stake (protecting voices versus protocol) tightens through a single meaningful deepening when he assembles Lale's unsent plea, forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges through particulars like the hearing aid's pulses and Lale's forgiveness, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to communication beyond death via the image of the crying woman, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., "hand clutching a photograph") and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward auditory and emotional nuances (e.g., "the hearing aid buzzed with a shy tick"). Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, from lyrical expanses to compressed beats. Elision (e.g., Lale's backstory) is taught early and pays off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and propulsion, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "Her unsent plea, assembled from those faint pulses, was simple: Tell her I forgave her first"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm supports accumulative tension. Minor overwriting in "reeling hush" repetition is offset by clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" synthesizes mystical and bureaucratic elements into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in lyric atmosphere heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable from Eren's established curiosity. Specific details (e.g., the switchboard operator's hearing aid) anchor universals with authenticity.</comment>
