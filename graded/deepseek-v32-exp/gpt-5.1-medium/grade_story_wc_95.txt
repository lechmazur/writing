<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Darius's characterization is deeply integrated with his philosophical dueling and mechanical arm, driving key choices. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like studying light rays and opening the tin, with micro-choices under pressure. The clients are briefly sketched but serve immediate pressure. Final agency in drawing the blade is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as the hidden overture begins, reconfiguring options with felt cost under the causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality tightens through Darius's realizations and actions. The sundial and tin constraints shape tactics, and cost is legible in the "poised, dignified chaos."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the atrium, brook, and sundial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like light rays and sounds are filtered through Darius's POV, integrating into action and theme. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Darius's agency under the causal lens, from waiting to realizing the tin-sundial connection and preparing for debate. Stakes around "ownership of tomorrow" intensify meaningfully, with cost felt in the final chaos. One tightening forecloses options through protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of turning questions into destinations emerges organically through particulars like dueling as argument and hidden overtures. Subtext operates in gesture and image, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the beginning overture, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Darius, with a distinct philosophical voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., past debates) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with purposeful figurative language and no loops or artifacts. Momentum is maintained through concrete action and image, though minor density in peak beats slightly tempers score. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Story synthesizes dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, and hidden overtures with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
