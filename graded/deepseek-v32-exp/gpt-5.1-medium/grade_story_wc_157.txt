<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as unrolling the map and negotiating permits. The final stance of working while the city sleeps is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk of defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with events linked by because/therefore logic. Closure is a decisive change when the entomologist joins, reconfiguring their options with felt cost in the shared risk. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like beetles clicking and terrariums glowing. The greenhouse constrains choices by providing cover and resources, charging the final image of rebellion rooting beneath the surface.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defiance escalates through protagonist agency, such as planning garden messages and warping paper trails. Cost is legible in the risk of tax audits, narrowing options and forcing trade-offs under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges organically from events and images, like the garden patterns and taxed dreams.

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "beetles click like impatient typewriters," is coherent and purposeful, advancing momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of taxable thoughts and garden messages is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with specific details. Risk-taking in structural choices, like the secret club, heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
