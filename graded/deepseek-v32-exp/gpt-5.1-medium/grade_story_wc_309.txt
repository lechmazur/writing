<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orren's characterization is deeply embodied with consistent traits and micro-choices under pressure; his final decision to step into mist is earned by prior causality and visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test with contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost (leaving safety for the unknown), under a clear accumulative/textural lens; orientation is anchored early, and the keystone's influence shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire and keystone constrict choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment pressuring Orren's actions throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Orren's agency under the accumulative lens, from passive observation to active rebellion; cost is legible when he unstraps and steps into mist, foregoing safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity emerges through events and images like the keystone's tag; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, melancholic tone; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., mist walking) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity, and propulsion is maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes automation and magic with specificity; risk-taking in the lyrical ending heightens stakes, and emotional truth avoids cliché, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
