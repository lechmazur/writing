<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to sketch absence instead of capturing an echo is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost. Micro-choices, like using the pendant, reveal values, but the lie about drawing feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the decision not to cage the echo reweights the premise with cost legible in "I brought back drawings, not chains." Under the accumulative/textural lens, pattern holds; orientation is clear early. The pendant's role shapes tactics, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with rooftop canals and giant's breathing constraining choices (e.g., canal keeper's stop). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV; the environment charges the final image. Micro-setting (pendant) alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding echoes' birthplace) escalates through protagonist's agency using the pendant, narrowing options. Under accumulative lens, density increases with time-borrowing; cost is visible in renunciation at climax. One meaningful tightening forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creation vs. control emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "drawings, not chains." Subtext in lies and choices; earned wisdom from specifics avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (illustrator's observational style). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; prose reflects character's mind under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in time manipulation is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language serves the story without muddle. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs. Closure image is clear and uncompromised by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing echoes, time sculpting, and moral choice. Risks in structure heighten stakes; transformation through specific details feels inevitable. No derivative elements; originality integrates fully with character and closure.</comment>
