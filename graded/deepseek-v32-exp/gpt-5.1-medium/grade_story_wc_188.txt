<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in defiance against despair, with embodied interiority shown through chants and sensory details. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as rhymes stumbling but persistence in design, and the final choice to ignite the fireworks is earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure, like tying the rag knot, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the fireworks hand image reweighting hope, and cost is legible in "catching hearts before they fall." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through imagery and stakes. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of the siege shapes tactics without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp earth and bruised petals" filtering through POV to pressure choices. The blooming fortress and rag knot constrict actions and charge the final image, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defying despair escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, such as designing the mosaic and using the rag knot. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional impact and risk of the spectacle. One meaningful tightening occurs as the fireworks assemble, narrowing options and deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the hand symbolizing "You are still held" without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to hopelessness through the fireworks display. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingers through particulars like the rag knot's reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "whispering his walking chant" during tension. Experimental elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "building a ladder from sparks." Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of spectacle and siege, transforming tropes through specific details like the blooming fortress and ambient awareness. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth arises from character complexity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
