<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving her choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "Grief sharpened within her, clean as the night air." The final renunciation—accepting the canyon as witness—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: Liora's realization that the canyon "only kept what remained" reconfigures her understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with orientation clear by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the final image of her steadier song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the canyon and seashell constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "wind shuffled down the ravine" are selective and purposeful, reflecting Liora's POV. The environment pressures her actions and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Liora's agency—singing, listening, questioning—leading to a deepening realization. The cost is legible in her grief and acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs as the echoes progress, foreclosing her initial quest with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the echoes and shell, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through Liora's acceptance, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in silences and implications, e.g., the "almost voice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Liora's poetic, grief-sharpened observations. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, e.g., "Sound swelled, folding over itself." Any elision in progressive disclosure is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "Her voice slid along the stone, a reed-blown melancholy." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity is maintained even in dense passages. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of grief and memory through the echo concept, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the seashell and canyon are irreplaceable, avoiding template plots.</comment>
