<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of shyness and desire to articulate unspoken needs. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "throat tight, feeling every unsung verse in him lean forward to listen." The final choice to let the ghost use him is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the city's sigh of relief. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "the city sighing in relief" and "thunder finally rolled, low and astonished." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and pattern. Orientation is clear early with "courtyard floated above the clouds" and Lio's presence. Persistent constraint of the wall's code shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the misty courtyard and wall constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "silver mist that caught every lantern-glow" and "damp stone." The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting, altering tactics and resonating at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs escalates under accumulative lens through Lio's agency, such as using the flower press and offering himself. Cost is unmistakable in "each sentence appeared, Lio felt a matching knot loosen in some unseen chest below." Escalation is driven by protagonist choices, narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of communication and silence emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "syllables that had found their shapes at last," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the wall's messages and Lio's internal struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lio, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose like "the hour between lightning and thunder." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Voice modulates with pressure, maintaining coherence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "trembling breath" and "falling sparks," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in non-obvious synthesis of ghost in code, graffiti, and unspoken needs, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
