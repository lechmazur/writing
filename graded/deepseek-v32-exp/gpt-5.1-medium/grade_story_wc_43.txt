<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's serene kindness and Mr. Alvarez's acceptance are embodied through specific micro-choices, such as her decision not to read the lab results and his request for the mundane song. Contradictory impulses are shown in Mira's thought about "executing a flawless goodbye," and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the reunification moment. No diagnostic label-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "full, not empty" silence, under an accumulative/textural lens. The vinyl fragment acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details like the "radiant haven above the clouds" and the cologne scent are sensory and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV. The broken vinyl record functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image by symbolizing shattered beauty and constraining choice when given to Mr. Alvarez.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening from the blood work result to the song and reunification. Cost is legible in Mr. Alvarez's acceptance and the final silence, foreclosing other paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of holiness in the mundane emerges through particulars like the song about trash day and the vinyl fragment, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the reunification image, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited from Mira's perspective, with a distinct perceptual signature in lines like "pulsing stillness." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (e.g., Mr. Alvarez's softened Spanish vowels). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "obedient ghost"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of hospice care, broken vinyl, and mundane holiness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, emotional resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
