<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Erasmus's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices like seed selection revealing his values. Interiority is concrete, though passivity in ritual slightly limits intense internal conflict. Final endurance is earned, with cost in ongoing effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in the final image of seeds carried by tides. Orientation is clear early, and structure builds pattern toward resonant reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the jetty and flowers constraining choices (e.g., seed release based on currents). Environment charges the final image, and specificity integrates seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through repeated rituals, deepening the healing theme. Erasmus's agency in fertilizing forecloses other paths with visible cost in gradual growth. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in bird communications. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and complexity lingers through particulars like the reef's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose reflects Erasmus's mind. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., bird languages) is taught and paid off. Voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing dead languages, bird communication, and ecological renewal with specificity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
