<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final choice to trade grief for sight is earned by prior causality, and her internal conflict between familiar darkness and overwhelming light is dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (wilted plants, tears), redefining beauty through imperfections under an accumulative/textural lens. The phoenix's aftermath and trade sequence create coherent causality, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard constrains choices with residual heat and glass shards, charging the final image of broken beauty. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the reed and plants functioning as micro-settings that pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeing true vs. imperfect beauty) escalates through Mira's agency in the trade, forcing a sacrifice with visible cost. Pressure tightens under the accumulative lens via the negotiation and awakening, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically from Mira's realization, with subtext in the plant arrangement and final painting plan. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by colorblindness; voice modulates under pressure with poetic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the exchange with Theo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the awakening scene, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of bartered awakenings offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through character-specific details like the reed and colorblindness. Risk-taking in lyric prose and quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
