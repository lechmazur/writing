<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. However, lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher score despite strong interiority and micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in "aching legs and a full heart," under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) is effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald lighthouse and its lens constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her physical state and prophecies. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in prophecies and light language. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is strong, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language enhances clarity and propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with risk-taking in poetic style that heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific details feels inevitable.</comment>
