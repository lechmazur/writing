<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" is clear and intensifies under pressure, shown through micro-choices like casting coins and interpreting static. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "quietly enthusiastic" and "stellar doubt" acting simultaneously. The final alignment is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with visible cost in dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—Mira's acceptance of dissolution reweights the premise, legible in "the amber began to glow." Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern builds through coin castings and static bursts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the contracting universe as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the ambered observatory and foreign coins constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "crystalline resin that caught light from dying stars." The coins' spiral mirrors the galaxy's collapse, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of alignment escalates through Mira's agency in coin castings and message translations, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her acceptance of dissolution, with a meaningful tightening in the final casting where "every coin landed on edge."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of un-becoming emerges through particulars like the backwards prophecy and coin patterns, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "trusting that un-happening was just another way of becoming," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, controlled syntax. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "static bursts had resolved into a single clear tone." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "the universe speaking its final words first." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build, and closure is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing backwards prophecy and cosmic contraction with specific details like coin divination. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth emerges through Mira's journey, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
