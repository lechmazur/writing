<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion in sorrow units. Her final choice to maintain the balance is earned through prior causality, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Maren reconfigures her purpose, under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is clear early, and the sextant's healing drives causal linkage to the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the stormlit tower and trees constraining choices. The final image of leaves holding storm and moonlight charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maren's agency with the sextant, leading to a legible cost in released grief. Under Hybrid lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though one minor tightening limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed grief emerges organically through trees and dreams, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext in arboreal memory deepens reflection.</comment>
