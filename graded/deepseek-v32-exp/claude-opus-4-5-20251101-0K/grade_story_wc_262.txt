<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; her final choice to release the love is earned through psychometry, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like threading the film strip. Contradictory impulses (seeking vs. releasing) act in scene, and cost is visible in tears and the planting metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: unused love is for planting, not retrieval, with cost in tears and hushed thunder softening to rain. Accumulative lens holds, orientation is early, and persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly detailed with sensory specificity; the projection booth and projector constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating into action and theme through details like cork walls and dust motes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Vera's agency in psychometry reading to realization; cost is legible in emotional release and the seeding metaphor, under accumulative lens with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of seeds in shadow, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with pressure through phrases like "nitrate dreams" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts, with figurative language like "hushed thunder" serving clarity and closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis of psychometry and unused love feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
