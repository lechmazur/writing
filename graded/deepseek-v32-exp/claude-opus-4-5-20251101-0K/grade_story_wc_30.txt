<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with her titan-gear exoskeleton and moon-phase fluctuations concretely shaping her actions and interiority. Her motivation to preserve wonder in routine is dramatized through micro-choices like smelting documents, and her final acceptance of contradictions earns its cost through prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict about identity migrates authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of "finding beauty in the impossible persistence of memory." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pattern and density through the fisherman's visit and Mira's reflections. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the tidal atrium pressures choices (tides rising, moon phases affecting strength) and charges the final image through sensory details like "wintersun pale and gentle." Specificity is high and filtered through Mira's POV, with the environment constraining tactics and mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases—the fisherman's question and rising tides deepen Mira's commitment to preserving wonder. Agency is in her renunciation of singular truth, foreclosing a path with cost legible in her embrace of contradictions. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: migrating identities and acceptance of contradictions are explored through concrete actions like smelting documents. Subtext operates in gestures and images, with the final offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters details through Mira's worldview. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with the fisherman. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, e.g., "yesterday that stretched behind like an ocean floor." Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of temporal collapse, migrating identities, and lunar mechanics, all serving character and conflict. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
