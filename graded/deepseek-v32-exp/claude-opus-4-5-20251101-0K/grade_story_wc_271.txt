<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mariam's characterization is deeply rooted in her trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as the freeze response to the hawk and the use of somatic markers. Her final renunciation to find stillness is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the ongoing struggle. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mariam accepts the "pearl of stillness," with felt cost in her enduring trauma. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to a decisive change in stance. Orientation is clear early, and the lighthouse keeper's ghost subtly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choices (e.g., salt-blasted soil requiring specific gardening tactics) and charges the closure image of cultivated beauty above indifferent ocean. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mariam's POV, with the environment actively shaping her actions and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the hawk incident triggers a freeze response that Mariam manages through somatic markers, narrowing her options and demonstrating cost. The dominant stake of internal conflict between trauma and healing tightens meaningfully, with visible price in the panic and recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the photograph and earrings, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing through the "pearl of stillness" concept. Subtext operates in gesture and image, resisting moralizing and embracing complexity without confusion, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mariam's lyrical, trauma-filtered observations. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., compressed diction during freeze response), and any elision (e.g., wedding details) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and character seamlessly, even in peak beats like the hawk incident. Varied syntax and concrete imagery support momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma survivor, arboretum setting, and somatic markers feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, internal narrative heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform familiar tropes, and the closure reweights prior material with originality.</comment>
