<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply embodied, with trauma responses translating into data, and her final choice to bury the mask is earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and internal conflict is shown through simultaneous physical and emotional sensations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elena redefines mercy, felt cost in burying the mask; accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern taught early and orientation clear within 120 words. The ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elena's POV. Bioluminescent bark and mathematical patterns are integral to tactics and closure, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the accumulative lens, as enhanced perception reveals mathematical truths, narrowing options. Cost is legible in her physical trembling and the burial of the mask, foreclosing her past path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the mathematics of mercy offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery like the mask burial, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, prose rhythm modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in trauma memories is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "seismograph of suffering" is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of trauma and mathematics, transforming tropes with specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
