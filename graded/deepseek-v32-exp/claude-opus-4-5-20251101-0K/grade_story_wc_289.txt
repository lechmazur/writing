<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., unwrapping the nest, writing her own letter). Her final choice to return with renewed purpose is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost in her lighter hands and renewed practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira's realization reconfigures her purpose, with cost legible in "lighter hands" and the dissolution of her secret. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with imagery and reflection tightening meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV (e.g., "translucent spheres drifting among the lotus flowers"). The temple and pond constrain choices, and the nest object charges the final image, supporting the theme of connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over purpose) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's reflection and the art installation, leading to her agency in writing and releasing the letter. Cost is unmistakable in her renewed commitment, foreclosing her prior emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through motifs (nest, spheres) without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to connection and practice. Subtext in imagery (e.g., "the nest must hold") deepens the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., reflection interleaved with action) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "architecture that seemed too delicate to endure"), and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of love letter ghostwriter, thrush's nest, and public art installation feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet reflection heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., "twig spiral") avoid template plots, and closure integrates elements organically.</comment>
