<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to bind the community is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like Yusuf's "sullenness masked something more fragile." Her intergenerational support drive is consistent, and Yusuf's growth with the bell shows credible endurance. The final choice to continue is earned by prior causality, with cost in ongoing exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens, as the photograph and bell ringing reconfigure hope with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The anonymous donation twist deepens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the terra-cotta arbor and salt winds filtering through Mira's POV. The arbor constrains gatherings, and the bell charges the final image. Sensory details like "rationed candlelight" reflect urgency without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival escalates through midnight food runs and anonymous donations, driven by Mira's agency. Cost is legible in risks taken during patrols. Under accumulative lens, pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening when Yusuf examines the bell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational support emerges through particulars like the bell and bread-making, not statement. Subtext operates in Yusuf's silent bell examination. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the photograph, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "moon hung low and silver." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Yusuf's question about the bell. Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "architecture of survival" is purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exile tropes through specific details like the bell and sanctions. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
