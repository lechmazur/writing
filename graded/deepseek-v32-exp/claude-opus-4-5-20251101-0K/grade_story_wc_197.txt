<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of quiet resistance; her interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like clutching the key. The final choice to continue fighting is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her risk-taking and endurance. However, minor diagnostic label-speak in peaks (e.g., "carefully resourceful" as a trait label) slightly reduces embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (truth disseminated) with felt cost in Mira's ongoing struggle. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The decoy explosion is a minor convenience but does not break causality or closure cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the auric lagoon and reflections constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, such as using the lagoon's glow for navigation. The environment shapes tactics and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth) escalates under causal lens via Mira's agency, driven by the raid threat. Her actions (uploading files, triggering decoy) narrow options with visible cost in risk and continued resistance. One meaningful tightening occurs, though the decoy resolves a problem it didn't create, slightly softening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of contested history emerges through particulars like the key and documents, with subtext in gestures and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Mira's resolve. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., reflection method) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is absent, but internal narration remains coherent. Minor register drift in peaks (e.g., "coded freedom") doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and no major artifacts. Sentences advance momentum, though minor template cadence occurs in action sequences (e.g., "She knelt... She found..."). Figurative language is purposeful and doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes through specific details like puddle reflections and phone booth key. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious angle on resistance feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
