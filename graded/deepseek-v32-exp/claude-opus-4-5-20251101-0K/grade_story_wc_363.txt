<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied emotions (calloused fingers, understanding raveling silence) and micro-choices under pressure (arranging puzzle pieces, placing the bead). The final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost as she unravels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (Mei vanishes, leaving a pattern), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds throughout. The orchard's transformation and golden thread vanishing provide a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (bamboo forest, orchard with sensory details like creaking bamboo and light fragments), constraining choices as the orchard remembers itself. The amber bead and puzzle pieces as micro-setting charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering the message) escalates under Accumulative lens through Mei's agency (recommencing work, unraveling), with cost legible in her sacrifice. One meaningful tightening deepens the stakes without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of love, sacrifice, and connection emerges through events and imagery (weaving, silence), with a resonant, non-literal answer in the reunited weavers. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice, weaving metaphors, and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present (Mei's call across years).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and clarity without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "stoically sparkling" light, enhancing momentum without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of weaving, time-crossing, and family legacy, transformed through specific details (puzzle edges, amber bead). Risk-taking with lyrical style pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
