<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's influence, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her hesitation before taking the fragment. The final choice is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is shown in scene. No major flaws affect closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkage from inciting incident to closure, where Mira's decision to take the fragment results in a decisive change with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Closure lands on-page with cost proof in the image of overlapping worlds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with selective sensory details (e.g., phosphorescent lanterns, swaying bridges) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The market constrains tactics and integrates with action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring overlooked histories escalates through Mira's agency, with one meaningful tightening when she unfastens the fragment, forcing a trade-off with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, and the choice forecloses a path with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the painting's hidden details, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of layered worlds, avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, reflected in poetic yet precise prose. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., intuitive pulls) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the fragment's revelation. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of concepts like the between-worlds translator and alchemist's market, transformed via specific details and character-driven stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens coherence, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
