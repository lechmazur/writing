<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply interior and consistent, with her spiritual curiosity and evolution from ambition to finding strength in vulnerability embodied through specific actions like tracing stars. Her final stance of Earned Stasis is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitude and aging. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira's acceptance of her role reweights meaning with felt cost in the final image of the station's "ancient peace." Orientation is clear early; structure is a single scene with one meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in her joint aches and smiled resignation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Mira's POV, with sensory details like "stardust" and "cold metal railing" that constrain choice (e.g., lantern glass transforms perception). The observatory environment charges the final image of the "yellow lantern glass" glowing at dawn, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in Mira's insights, driven by her agency in tracing stars and using the lantern. Dominant stake—internal conflict between vulnerability and strength—tightens with cost legible in her aged body and solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks a dramatic turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "flourishing stillness" emerges organically through particulars like the lantern glass transforming "falling into flying," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the cosmos's "eternal dance" mirroring Mira's ritual, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, reflective voice that modulates under pressure (e.g., "primal elegance" of dawn). Perceptual signature is character-specific, noticing "stardust" and "ancient loneliness." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue absent, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "bloom" for meteors is consistent and purposeful. No register drift or artifacts in peak beats; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a cosmic janitor finding meaning in stillness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis, transformed through specific details like the yellow lantern glass. Emotional truth avoids templates; risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
