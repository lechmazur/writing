Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Marta decides to walk east, reconfiguring her purpose from finding bodies to following the living, with felt cost in her courage and the wild hush. The causal drive lens holds strong, with events linked through because/therefore progression from riddle to discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the scrapyard settlement and compost pit constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding Sera escalates through protagonist agency, as Marta's solving of the riddle and digging for the box narrow options and change knowledge.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature in phrases like "her graying muzzle twitching at dust instead of death."

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of a bloodhound's post-apocalyptic quest, transforming tropes through specific details like the phonograph encoding.
