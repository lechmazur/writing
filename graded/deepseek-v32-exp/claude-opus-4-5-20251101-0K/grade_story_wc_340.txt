<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her warmly inquisitive nature drives key choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as clutching the case and the goggles' warmth. The final choice to release the memories is earned by prior causality and the diary's revelations, with visible cost in Lady Vesper's tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with each floor deepening stakes through diary entries. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira releases the light, transforming grief with cost legible in Lady Vesper's gasp and tears. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (goggles, diary) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the icebound spire pressures choices via the elevator's constrained ascent. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the "frosted window" and "ice crystals." The environment constrains choice and charges the final image with the observatory's jars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking joy beneath anguish escalates through Mira's agency in decoding the diary and ascending. Under accumulative lens, density increases with each floor, culminating in a legible cost when light scatters and touches Lady Vesper. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the diary's metaphor of joy as "heavier coat" and the act of releasing light. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, like Lady Vesper's distant affection. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Mira's voice is rhythmic and purposefully compressed, as in "The ascending servant had finally reached the top." No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, like "grief is merely joy wearing a heavier coat." Read-aloud test passes; closure image is sharp and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements—elevator ascent, encrypted diary, goggles—feels inevitable and fresh. Emotional specificity avoids tropes; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes with unique character-driven arc.</comment>
