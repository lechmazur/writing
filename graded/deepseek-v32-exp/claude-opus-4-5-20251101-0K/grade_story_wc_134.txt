<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and credible internal conflict. Her final renunciation of future-seeing for present appreciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her weeping. The change forecloses her old path with felt emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with cost in Vera's realization, reweighting her life's premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation anchored early. The pilgrim's death incites causal linkage, and the cave's challenges tighten options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal cave constrains choices through shadows and song, charging the final image with sensory specificity. Details are filtered through Vera's POV, integrating environment with action. The setting pressures tactics and supports theme cohesively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Vera's quest escalates under accumulative lens through cave descent and shadow encounters.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of everyday magic emerges from particulars like the cave pearl and visions, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control.

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts.
