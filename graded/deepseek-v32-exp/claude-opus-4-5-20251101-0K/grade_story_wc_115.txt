<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority that is concrete and character-particular. His emotional progression is realistic, embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as trembling fingers while appraising the beads. The final renunciation and commitment to action are earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he touches the amber bead and decides to "make them count."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus's realization reweights the premise of erased truths, with felt cost legible in the image of him touching the bead and turning back. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from discoveries to his decisive change. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the tunnel and valve room pressure Marcus's investigation and the beaded wheel becomes a pivotal object. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV, such as "dust-thick air" and "rusted track switches." The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, as his appraising of the beads narrows options and deepens knowledge, leading to the climax. The cost is unmistakable when he understands the ghost shift's memorial and commits to action, foreclosing his prior skepticism. Stakes are braided and tighten meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erased truths and commemoration emerges through particulars like the beads and Clara's calls, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marcus's realization and decision, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the valve wheel's memorial meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's skeptical, goal-driven voice. Prose rhythm varies naturally under pressure, and elision (e.g., Clara's calls) is taught and pays off at closure. Dialogue, though minimal in earbuds, carries subtext and advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "tunnel mouth gaped like a confession," is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs, and diction remains within Marcus's lexicon, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "ghost shift" concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific details like the bead memorial. Risk-taking in structure, such as interweaving radio calls, heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth is specific and avoids generic templates.</comment>
