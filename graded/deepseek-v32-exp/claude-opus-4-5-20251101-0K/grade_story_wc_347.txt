<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's reluctance and acceptance are embodied through specific actions like carrying the nut and responding to dreams, with internal conflict shown in her repeated returns to the orchard. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with clear closure: the birds' restored song and Maren's return to the orchard form a decisive change with cost legible in her acceptance of the caretaker role. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks or teleporting props occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., icy paths, bird patrols) and charges the final image of the "graceless beauty" valley. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action, with coherent spatial choreography and POV-filtered description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding travelers escalates through the impending frost and bird reactions, driven by Maren's agency in using the nut. Cost is visible in her renewed commitment to the orchard, and pressure tightens meaningfully under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of burden and purpose emerges from particulars like the nut's use and orchard's curse, with subtext in Maren's actions. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature, lyrical prose, and natural dialogue that advances plot. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression in descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story efficiently, and clarity is maintained in peak beats without overwriting or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mechanical birds, cursed orchard, and impression-leaving nuts feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements seamlessly.</comment>
