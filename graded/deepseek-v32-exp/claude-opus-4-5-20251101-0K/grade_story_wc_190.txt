<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eris's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting cables and opening the vial. Her final action feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Eris's intervention reconfigures the terrace's silence, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. The storm glass vial's dissolution catalyzes a conceptual repricing, with cost legible in the final image of comfort. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the prism terrace and storm glass vial constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures Eris's actions, such as navigating sound pockets, and details are woven through action with purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early in Eris's purpose, escalating under the accumulative lens through her monitoring and the vial's dissolution. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost felt in the transformation of silence. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and comfort emerges through particulars like the vial and terrace, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the dissolving crystals, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Eris's sound-based worldview. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, such in the description of silence "opening, like a door." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language, like "dust made of light," is purposeful and clear. Minor scaffold in repetitive sensory focus prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of grief, sound, and silence, with a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core premise is transformed through specific details like the storm glass, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
