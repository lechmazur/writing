<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens, with the reservoir's recession triggering Martha's investigation through photographs, leading to the closure of her discovering her father's abandonment. Closure is a decisive change—her acceptance and decision to share the truth—with felt cost in the tears and laughter. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of the resurfacing town shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like the "copper tubes" of the wind chime and "dripping" train station, filtered through Martha's POV.

Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, such as the ridgeway providing a vantage point for reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory, truth, and control emerges organically through images like the wind chime's silence and resurfacing town, without direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a stable single POV and perceptual signature biased by Martha's role as levee warden.
