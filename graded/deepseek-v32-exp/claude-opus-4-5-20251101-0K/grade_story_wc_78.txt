<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied micro-choices under pressure, but lacks significant internal contradiction or flaws that compound; final endurance is earned with visible cost in isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "smiled into the gathering dark" and prophecy of more debris; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., wreckage alters tactics) and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost in endless cycle; stake in transforming obstacles tightens through hull assessment and cloud reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges from particulars without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through image of "dubbing destruction into creation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "sky's rough draft") but no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts; specific details (floating orchard, musical wreckage) feel inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
