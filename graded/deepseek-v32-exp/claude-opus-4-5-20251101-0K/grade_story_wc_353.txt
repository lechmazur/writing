<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing stress cracks. Her final choice to play the instrument is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. Minor hairline slip in lacking overt internal conflict, but embodied emotion and credible endurance are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as Maren's internal music and plan to teach others reconfigure meaning with felt cost in the silence. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction. The stress-crack analysis drives causality, and cost is legible in the vibration felt "inside her bones."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "whisper of sap" filtering through Maren's POV. The alder grove and sculpture constrain choices and charge the final image, as roots "drink the vibrations." Economy of detail supports momentum, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating music in silence escalates through Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in the internal vibration and hedgehog's response. One meaningful tightening occurs when she strums the instrument, narrowing options and foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and adaptation emerges organically from events like analyzing stress cracks, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of music "finding a new way home," avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Maren's "symphonically minded" thoughts shape narration. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with purposeful compression in peaks. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "silence... profound as prayer" is consistent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without sluggishness, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes silence, music, and empathy in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specifics like stress-crack analysis feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
