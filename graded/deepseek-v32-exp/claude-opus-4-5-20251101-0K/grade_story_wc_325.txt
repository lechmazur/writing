<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia and motivation to remember the unremembered are consistently embodied through physical reactions and micro-choices under pressure, such as forcing herself to breathe in tight spaces. Her internal conflict between fear and duty drives the narrative, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost. The characterization avoids stock phrasing and demonstrates contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with Mira writing the names, reweighting the theme of remembrance with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and emotional weight. The tidal window constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early with anchors like the flooded elevator shaft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting pressures choices through enclosed spaces and the tidal timeframe, while the codex with gold flecks charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "water that had turned the color of weak tea." The environment constrains Mira's actions and enhances atmosphere without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through claustrophobia and the narrowing tidal window. Cost is legible in her physical struggle and the urgency of documentation. The dominant stake of remembrance is signaled early and deepens with each body found.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the codex and Mira's witness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to remembrance without moralizing. Subtext operates in images such as "gold flecks like small preserved stars." The ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost tied to memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "The crashing hush of the deep pressed against her suit." Mira's perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "drowned cathedral." Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of claustrophobic exploration with witness theme, transformed through specific details like undersea cables and phase transitions. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable and memorable.</comment>
