The final luminous change is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her altered perspective, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, building through imagery and reflection to a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on-page with cost in Mira's realization, reweighting the premise of homecoming. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the amber object persistently shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding the alien message, escalating through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens via density increase in reflection and revelation.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure.
