<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. Her final choice to release the memories rather than take them shows contradictory impulses in scene, with visible cost in forfeiting proof for personal witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "the lonesome splendor of having touched something that could not be proven." Orientation is clear early, and the persistent oxygen constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the underwater temple and crystal vial constraining choices and charging the final image. The environment pressures actions through depth, oxygen limits, and the temple's design, integrated seamlessly with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative/Textural lens through density of memory encounters and oxygen depletion, driven by Marina's agency in unsnarling and releasing memories. Cost is unmistakable in her ascent with an empty vial, foreclosing her original goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and witness emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the empty vial and carried memory. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory and exploration tropes, transformed through specific details like the crystal vial and gathered hush. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
