<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's charming rogue scholar persona is consistently embodied through micro-choices like calculating angles and smiling to recruit Sofia. Sofia's understanding "bloomed across her face" shows earned internal shift. Their status dynamics under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, with no diagnostic label-speak. Final choice to teach the language is motivated by prior causality and defiance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from discovery to recruitment to charged poise closure. Orientation anchors who, where, when by line 3. Closure unit lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "slow patient work of planting something the taxmen couldn't touch," reconfiguring options without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting constrains choice by housing the seed and enabling secret meeting, with sensory details like "glass walls that sweated with humidity" filtering through Marcus's POV. Recurring insect imagery charges the final image as "secret songs." Micro-setting of gourd seed actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of thought freedom escalates through protagonist agency: Marcus's recruitment of Sofia narrows options by leveraging her garden infrastructure. Cost is felt in the risk of defiance, with one meaningful tightening from discovery to plan execution under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges through particulars like gourd seeds as punctuation and garden patterns, not statement. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer with "virus of hope" image. Subtext operates in Sofia's glove removal and seed reach, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marcus, with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "converging chaos of wings and legs." Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, e.g., "You're candidly cryptic." Minor register elevation in "mandibles clicking like a chorus of tiny conspirators" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "Time is the one thing they haven't figured out how to tax yet." No paraphrase loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "bloomed with rebellion" is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of taxing thoughts synthesized freshly with secret garden language, transforming resistance tropes through specific details like gourd rattle seeds. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
