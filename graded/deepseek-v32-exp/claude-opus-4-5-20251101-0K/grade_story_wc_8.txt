<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like hesitating to burn the letter. Her final decision to upload evidence is earned by prior causality and internal conflict, showing credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (uploading files) and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no breaks. The persistent constraint of truth versus lies shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific with sensory details like "ivy crawled up Victorian brickwork," but it doesn't directly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, capping the score despite strong tone and integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the causal lens, from internal debate to uploading evidence, with cost legible in "It would not be painless." The dominant stake of truth versus noble lies tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, like "carrying truth like a torch," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Vera's hesitation enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose texture, e.g., "green fire frozen in time," supports pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story efficiently, e.g., the closure image propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of noble lies and historical forgery, transformed through specific details like the illuminated letter; risk-taking in thematic depth feels inevitable and coherent.</comment>
