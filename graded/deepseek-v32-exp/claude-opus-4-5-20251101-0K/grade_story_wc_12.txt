<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in Elena's trembling and tears. The final renunciation is earned through rhetorical questioning, though Elena's passivity during possession slightly limits interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elena's freedom, cost legible in her scream and laugh. Causal lens holds tightly from Marcus's questions to resolution, and the three-minute timeframe constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors the cathedral and dimensional anchor, which pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like cold stone and hum are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early and escalate through Marcus's rhetorical devices, driven by his agency under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in Elena's emotional release and the conceptual shift about doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of doubt vs. certainty emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in silence and questions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision in the acoustic void is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism with rhetorical devices and dimensional elements feels inevitable. Risk-taking with abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific details.</comment>
