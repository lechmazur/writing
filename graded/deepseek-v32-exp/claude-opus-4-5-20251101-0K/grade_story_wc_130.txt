<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her brother's disappearance, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned through prior causality, and internal conflict is shown in scene, such as when she traces the mosaic with fingertips. The closure choice to map her own loss rather than find Theo has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where Mira realizes she must solve for herself, not Theo. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in her acceptance of absence. The mosaic pattern and equations build density that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the dripping water sustaining the orchard and influencing Mira's calculations. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image with the brighter orchard after her realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's quest to understand grief, escalating through her agency in using the glass eyes and equations. Under accumulative lens, density increases with the apparition's emergence, and cost is legible in her shifted focus to surviving absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and self-mapping emerges organically from events and images, like the glass eyes and mosaic. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's acceptance, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and selective attention to the orchard. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in the whispered dialogue with the apparition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, e.g., "the mathematics of emotion." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conjuring, taxidermy, and emotional mathematics feels inevitable and organic. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific detail.</comment>
