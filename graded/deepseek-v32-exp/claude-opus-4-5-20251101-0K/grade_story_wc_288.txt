<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her isolation and reincarnation memory, with embodied emotion like "calcified around her heart." Her final choice to cultivate new life is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between grief and duty. Micro-choices under pressure, such as descending to the stone circle, reveal her values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Mira shifts from preservation to cultivation, costing her grief but welcoming new life. The causal drive lens holds, with the reincarnation memory and sundial use creating because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and constraints like the stone circle shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "atomically reflective surfaces" and "cloud tides" filtered through Mira's POV. The tidal library and stone circle constrain choices and charge the final image by enabling the birth of new creatures, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as she uses the sundial to birth new life, narrowing options from isolation to connection. Cost is legible in her tears and shifted purpose, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses her path of mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as isolation transforming into strength through the sundial's use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Not to mourn what was lost, but to welcome what was coming," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature like "manuscripts that arrived on mist currents." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "calcified around her heart" is purposeful and clear. Syntax varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of concepts like tidal library and reincarnation memory, transformed by specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
