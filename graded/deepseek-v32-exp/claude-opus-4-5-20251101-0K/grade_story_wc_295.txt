<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and duty, with embodied emotion like "eyes burning with exhaustion and unshed tears." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as charting stars and translating inscriptions, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final decision to share burdens is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira decides to publish, sharing the burden, with felt cost in her tears and brother's memory. The causal drive lens holds strong, with steps like telescope alignment and cross-referencing leading logically to revelation. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints like family legacy shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, e.g., "cold embrace" of the dome and "faintly fragrant" daylily, charging the final image of dawn and solace. The observatory and stars enable discovery but do not strongly constrain choices; however, specificity supports atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding and sharing burdens escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency in charting stars and translating inscriptions. Cost is unmistakable in emotional realization and foreclosed isolation, with one meaningful tightening at the translation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from events and imagery, like the variable stars and telegram, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "light enough to bear," reweighting prior material with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature reflective of Mira's profession and grief. Rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "When understanding dawns...," and no head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, e.g., "heartbeat across light-years," and clarity persists through peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars, and temple inscriptions feels fresh and inevitable, with emotional specificity avoiding tropes. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, though it leans on familiar themes of burden and legacy.</comment>
