<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her genuine tears and altered professional stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the amber grotto and blotter petal buildup cohere, and orientation is anchored early. The final image of leaving the petal reweights options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (amber light, pine resin) filtered through POV; the grotto constrains choice by enabling the transformation and charges the final image through static electricity and residual emotions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the Accumulative lens, from inhaling the petal to subsuming her defenses; cost is legible in her tears and decision to change her approach, narrowing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (blotter petal, grotto) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to authenticity vs. counterfeit, reweighting prior material through Vera's transformation and the petal's gift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature ("sensing through static electricity") and rhythmic control under pressure; elision is taught and paid off, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats slightly tempers score. Propulsion remains clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing emotion dealing with sensory magic; turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
