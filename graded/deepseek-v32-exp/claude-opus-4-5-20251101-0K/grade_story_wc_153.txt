<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like tracing the shard. The final choice to speak is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her cracked silence and steady hands. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. love) act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Celeste speaks her apology, reconfigured by the spirits' song, with felt cost in the whispered word and transformed hands. Causal lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early in the mangrove setting. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the mangrove labyrinth constraining choice (she waits rather than navigates) and charging the final image through moonlight and spirits. Sensory details are selective and integrated, such as the spirits' song threading through branches, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in apologizing escalates under causal lens through spirit interactions and revelations about the fire. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost legible in the cracked silence and steady hands. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and forecloses the path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and unsent messages emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the shard's warmth. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the mother's response, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic rhythm, and controlled elision. Voice modulates under pressure, such as the shift to condensation spelling words, without head-hopping. Diction remains character-bound and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "silver through dark water," and propulsion is clear even in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, mediumship, and magical elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, with specific details like moonlight healing transforming familiar tropes. Closure recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
