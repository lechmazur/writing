<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final decision to expose the truth is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible social cost. The ghost's desire for acknowledgment adds depth, avoiding stock resolutions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elise steps through, reconfigured by Mira's agency under a causal lens. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the harbormaster's inherited guilt. The structure tightens logically from investigation to revelation, with no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ice shrine and candles constrain Mira's choices by thinning the veil between worlds, charging the final image with frozen memory. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "candle flames that painted the glacier walls in amber and shadow," integrating setting into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dream analysis to exposing a murder, driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens. The cost is felt in the village's disrupted foundations and Elise's absolution. One meaningful tightening—the discovery of the lighthouse sabotage—narrows options and forces a moral choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the snow globe and "windows of connection," exploring memory and truth without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to salvaging purity from wreckage, with subtext in gestures like Elise clutching the globe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's role. Compression, such as "ghosts haunted moments," is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent under pressure, enhancing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "borrowed starlight," serves clarity and momentum. Every sentence advances character or atmosphere, and the closure image is sharp and cost-loaded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ghost-whispering and dream analysis with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded details like the melted snow globe. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
