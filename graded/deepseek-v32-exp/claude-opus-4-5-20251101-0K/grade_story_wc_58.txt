<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through her obituary-writing practice. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown in micro-choices like winding the thread. The final renunciation—carrying absence as precious—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the grooves on her finger and stiff joints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the final image of the thread worn into grooves. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed garden and crimson weft thread constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory detail purposeful and POV-filtered. The thread evolves in use, from loosening to winding into her braid, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, through the intimate act of projecting presence and writing. Cost is unmistakable in the physical wear on her finger and the dawn arrival, foreclosing the path of unresolved grief with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the weft thread and obituaries, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the thread as a promise, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the projection of presence, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the obituary writing. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of a traveler writing obituaries for the living is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the integration of elements is organic and specific.</comment>
