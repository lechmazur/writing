<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her exploration and choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when she presses her palm against the cave wall to sense temperature gradients. The final choice to communicate with the lights is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in her commitment to mapping. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent accumulative/textural lens, building pattern through sensory details to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is clear early, and the elm leaf fossil serves as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Closure lands with cost as Vera bridges epochs, felt in her voice echoing as an answer. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like damp limestone and bioluminescent lights, filtered through Vera's POV. The cave network constrains choices, narrowing passages and guiding her to the river chamber. Environment charges the final image, where the floating lights and fossil reconfigure meaning. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping and communication escalates through Vera's agency, from discovering the fossil to engaging with the lights. Under accumulative lens, density increases with emotional topography, and cost is legible in her prolonged effort. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lights respond, narrowing options. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inter-species communication emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the fossil as a transitional object. Subtext operates in gestures like offering the leaf, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the child's goodbye echoed in Vera's actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and sensory bias. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as when describing the fossil's warmth. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven when Vera speaks to the lights. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "silence had settled over the world like sediment" are purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of a sensory map maker in a post-hibernation world is fresh and specific, with the elm leaf fossil and bioluminescent entities forming a non-obvious synthesis. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative premise.</comment>
