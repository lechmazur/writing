<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with interiority shown through deliberate actions and dance. However, emotional depth occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, such as in the realization about fear, which slightly undermines embodiment. The final choice to carry the legacy is earned, but contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina understands her grandmother's message and ascends, with cost felt in the emotional weight of "encrypted courage." The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, building through discoveries and dance. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "green-gray light" and "marine growth," constraining choices as Marina navigates the lab. The sunken laboratory and objects like the journal charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with POV bias and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering legacy escalates through Marina's agency in decoding and dancing, leading to a cost-laden realization. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the escalation is more internal than external, slightly limiting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming vulnerability into strength emerges organically through images and events, such as the dance decoding and final ascent. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext deeply woven into the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that filters details through Marina's expertise. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression in the dance sequences enhances rhythm without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with vivid metaphors like "spider spinning its web" serving multiple roles. No loops or scaffold issues; sentence-level propulsion is strong, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of code-breaking, dance, and legacy, with tropes transformed through specific details. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
