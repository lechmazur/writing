<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority (heartbeat counting) and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of counting heartbeats is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her reclaimed wholeness. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("heavier and lighter at once"), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early (opal observatory, snow, Mira's purpose). The lens holds without ambiguity, and the porcelain shard constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (shimmering walls, muffling snow) filtered through Mira's POV. The opal observatory and ink patterns constrain choice and charge the final image, integrating environment with internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in defragmenting her ghost, under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible as she reclaims failures ("heavier and lighter"). Dominant stake (wisdom from failure) tightens through pattern density, foreclosing prior avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (porcelain shard, ink patterns), offering a resonant, non-literal answer to failure and wisdom. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, with no moralizing; the final image reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ink patterns) is taught and pays off at closure. Voice coherence enhances emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or overwriting. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats (e.g., "wisdom lived in the wreckage"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes digital ghost and defragmentation with emotional specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation through lived detail (porcelain shard) avoids derivative templates.</comment>
