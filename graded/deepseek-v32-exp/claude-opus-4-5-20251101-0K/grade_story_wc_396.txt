<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's characterization is deeply embodied, with internal conflict shown through her shadow-laced presence and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization—to include herself in empathy—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the shadows transform from chains to loyal hounds. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly, with Kira's summons and the mirror glimpses leading to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: the crystal whole, shadows reconfigured. Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraints (shadows, crystal) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful—the lighthouse orchard and ice floes pressure choices, while the vintage store mirrors constrain the climax by revealing past acts. Sensory details (salt spray, groaning ice) are filtered through Kira's POV and charge the final image of dawn and shifting ice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kira's internal conflict over self-empathy) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, via mirror glimpses that narrow options. Cost is legible in the crystal's glow and shadow transformation. One meaningful tightening forecloses her neglect of self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and self-compassion emerges organically through concrete particulars—mirrors, crystal, shadows—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the compass image, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., keeper's revelations). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., crystal's warmth) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a prayer refusing to be forgotten") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. No register drift or artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements—shadow peacekeeper, broken oracle fragment, mirror glimpses—feels inevitable and transforms tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure remains legible.</comment>
