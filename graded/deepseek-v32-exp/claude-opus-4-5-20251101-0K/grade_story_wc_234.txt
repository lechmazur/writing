<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown in moments like her voice cracking and the pocket-sun flaring. Her internal conflict between capturing and participating in presence is dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of her initial goal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional exchange with Theo. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in Mira's realization and the pocket-sun dimming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through emotional density rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear early with the ember nexus and characters anchored. A persistent constraint (the nautilus shell) shapes tactics and the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the "amber corona" and "geothermal whispers" filtered through Mira's POV. The ember nexus and objects like the pocket-sun constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with heat shimmers and shadows guiding movement. Environment pressures choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence) escalates through Theo's challenge, leading to Mira's agency in redefining her goal. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases via dialogue and emotional shifts, with cost felt in their interaction. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency, but the turn is more conceptual than action-based, slightly limiting peak intensity. Cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the nautilus shell and pocket-sun, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about presence and attention. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Theo's smile holding "the density of seven years." Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending scientific precision and romantic longing. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Theo's revelations. Voice modulates under pressure, as seen in Mira's cracked voice and the prose rhythm. No head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "palette of resolve" slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; propulsion is clear. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, science, and emotional inquiry feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the nautilus shell and pocket-sun transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry. A non-obvious angle on capturing time adds originality, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
