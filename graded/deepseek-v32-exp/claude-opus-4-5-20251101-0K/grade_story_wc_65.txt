<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her profession and philosophy, with internal conflict between terror and duty shown through concrete micro-choices. Her final decision to write "invitation" rather than prophecy is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of certainty with visible cost in her humility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira's humility reconfigures the act of prediction, with cost legible in the final image of the "unwritten future." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the spire's ascent tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the obsidian spire and frozen lake pressure Mira's isolation, while the kingfisher quill evolves from tool to symbol. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under causal lens is driven by Mira's agency—from terror to grounded calculation—culminating in a decisive choice that narrows options. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of certainty, aligning with the dominant stake of honest future-mapping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira's arc, exploring humility in prediction without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "invitations," reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends poetic observation and professional precision. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the "liminal space" contemplation) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("like a black tooth") is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ignorance cartography and predictive modeling into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
