<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique perception, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of transactional connection is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her changed ringing. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her weeping at the fifth station, revealing genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, with closure as a conceptual repricing where Mira's realization about connection reweights prior material with felt cost. The artificial pilgrimage structure is coherent, and orientation is anchored early. The final image of ringing bells without expectation lands with undeniable cost, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the laboratory and carbide lens constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, such as the "golden light" and "phonograph horns," evolving with her journey. The environment pressures her tactics and deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's listening stations, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, with each beat deepening her understanding. Cost is legible in her weeping and final realization, foreclosing her prior assumptions. The dominant stake of connection tightens meaningfully, and resolution is earned through alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the mother's call and whale song, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as the final bells symbolize trust in resonance. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Mira's sound-color synesthesia. Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, such as the lens focusing her question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with clear propulsion, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "vibration a thread thrown into the vast loom." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional beats. Information density is high, advancing story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of sound, pilgrimage, and connection, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through specific details like the carbide lens and dying languages, avoiding template plots.</comment>
