<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's molting personalities are a consistent and embodied trait that drives her actions, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. Her relationship with Ezra forces choices that alter their state, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mosaic structure with past and present shards teaches its pattern early, and closure lands with a conceptual repricing in the final image of resistance blooming in fractures, with felt cost in the enduring hope. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "stars poured through the gaps" filtered through Mira's POV. The setting evolves causally with events, such as welding shelves from scrap, and alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding and smuggling, with cost legible in risks taken. The dominant stake of resistance tightens through accumulated acts, but the escalation lacks a single decisive turn, slightly limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through beauty in fragmentation emerges from particulars like the false-bottomed tin and molting personalities, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with dialogue natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "fractured light through broken glass" is coherent and purposeful, and closure is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of resistance through library rebuilding and personality molting is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed to.</comment>
