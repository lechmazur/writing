<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a budding rune scholar, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like tracing runes, and her final choice to close loops is earned by prior causality. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, and her competence slightly outweighs struggle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as shadows begin returning, underpinned by a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in Mira's relearning and the precision required, with orientation anchored early. The automaton's guidance and Mira's actions create a because/therefore linkage that tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the observatory's machinery enabling the automaton's awakening. Sensory details like "clouds that glowed faintly with borrowed starlight" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The floating isle and twilight atmosphere pressure tactics without postcard generality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens from seeking answers to actively closing loops, driven by Mira's agency. The cost is visible in her relearning and the automaton's corrections, narrowing options. However, the escalation lacks a major reversal, relying on a single meaningful tightening, which limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from relearning and closing loops, with subtext in images like shadows as "outlines of everything that ever stood in sunlight." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, it leans slightly toward tidy resolution, missing deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction like "voice like chimes in distant wind" reflecting Mira's perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision in rune learning is taught and paid off. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "unfolding like a flower remembering spring," is coherent and advances atmosphere. Information density is high, and closure beats remain clear without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reality bending and shadow lore with specificity, transforming tropes through Mira's relearning arc. Emotional truth anchors originality, and risk-taking in the automaton's awakening heightens stakes. However, the concept isn't fully groundbreaking, limiting the score.</comment>
