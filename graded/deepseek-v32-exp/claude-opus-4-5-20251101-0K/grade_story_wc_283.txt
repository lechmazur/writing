<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and an earned shift from preventing the end to enabling a new beginning. Her methodical patience and the cost of responsibility are concretely shown, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("weight of responsibility"), under an accumulative/textural lens reinforced by pattern recognition. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight from buttons to jar to wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details (e.g., "stalactites of crystallized resin like frozen tears") filtered through Marlowe's POV. Micro-setting elements like buttons and jar actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marlowe's agency in cataloging buttons, leading to a reweighting of the prophecy from prevention to rebuilding. Cost is legible in her carried responsibility, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like buttons and the echo jar, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and renewal without moralizing. Subtext is rich in imagery and realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "fossilized crates that once held honey"). Rhythm and diction control under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "silence settled like a held breath"), and propulsion is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes (e.g., prophecy as instruction manual) feels inevitable, with specific details like hourglass turning and amber warehouse. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
