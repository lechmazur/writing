<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal her values. The "perpetually surprised" trait feels slightly diagnostic but is embodied in key moments. Her final choice to continue the journey is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though the pilgrim's role is functional but not deeply crucible-like.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight because/therefore linkages, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (continuation over closure) with felt cost on-page. Orientation is anchored early, and the dome mechanism payoff is earned. Closure lands decisively with the map revelation, shaping Mira's new path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the observatory and dusk environment constraining choices (e.g., dome alignment) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating seamlessly with action to enhance stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully under the causal lens through Mira's agency, with the chip discovery and lever pull narrowing options. Cost is legible in her renunciation of closure for continuation. One tightening is sufficient, though the pilgrim's arrival slightly relies on coincidence that complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically through particulars like the star trails and chips, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the map of human connection, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. Elision in the star trail method is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language like "sun bled its last copper light" is purposeful. Minor scaffold in repetitive "star trail" phrasing but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a frequency of belonging is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending sci-fi and literary elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image transforms tropes through specific detail.</comment>
