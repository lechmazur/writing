<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies through methodical hope; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., crying, warmth in chest). Final choice to continue painting is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in insomnia transformed into gift. Contradictory impulses of grief and hope act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya realizes kindness echoes and commits to painting; cost is felt in insomnia's revaluation. Accumulative lens holds via daydreams and connections. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows from brush use to email proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: greenhouse as sanctuary contrasts smog-choked city, moonlight triggers daydreams. Sensory details (condensation, amber pigments) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness is remembered) escalates under accumulative lens via daydreams, painting, and email confirmation; agency drives tightening, with cost in emotional transformation. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events: kindness transcends lost languages, answered non-literally in final image of continued painting. Subtext in brush and portraits; no moralizing. Ending reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, observant). Voice modulates under pressure; elision (daydream mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "smog pressed like a living thing") is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of inheritance, insomnia, and lost languages through specific details; transforms tropes with grounded choices. Risk in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
