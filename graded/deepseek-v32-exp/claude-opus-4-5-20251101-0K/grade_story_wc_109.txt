<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oracle's quiet obsession is embodied and drives the climax; her bleeding fingers and final smile show earned endurance with cost, though interior contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via conceptual repricing (void as navigable) with cost in star's death and her effort; orientation clear and structure tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid setting (fort, storm) pressures ascent; booklet and star charge the final map-making with sensory precision, constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally as stars dim; her agency in mapping the void leads to legible cost and reconfiguration under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding paths in silence emerges through action; ending image of glowing booklet offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable POV with lyrical, rhythmic prose; perceptual signature distinct and consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegant, dense prose without loops; figurative language enhances clarity and momentum in peak beats, with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle and void-mapping; specific details like flaking gold leaf feel organic and indispensable, with risk in silence summarization.</comment>
