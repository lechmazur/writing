<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's characterization is deeply embodied, with interior contradictions shown through her carving as a container for grief. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The quick test is satisfied with contradictory impulses acting in scene and a visible cost in her acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing in the final image of steam and light. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "Perhaps this had always been enough." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights prior material with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the rain-beaded skylight and loft environment constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, and the micro-setting of the carving tool and wood alters tactics. The quick test is met with environment shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal grief escalates through accumulative deepening via carving and reflection. Protagonist agency in endurance and attention forecloses paths with visible cost, such as in the crystallization of moments. Under the textural lens, a single meaningful intensification reweights stakes with cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like carving and memory, avoiding direct statement. Subtext operates through image and implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final realization that "nothing truly disappears" reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent and lyrical, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure. The quick test is satisfied with clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum. Read-aloud test passes with syntactic variety and clarity in peak beats. No scaffold or template cadence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of grief work through lion carving, with specific, grounded details. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through character-specific choices elevates the narrative.</comment>
