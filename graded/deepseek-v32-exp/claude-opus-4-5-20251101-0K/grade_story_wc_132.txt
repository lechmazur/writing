<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as her fear and acceptance of transformation. Her final surrender is earned by prior causality, including the linden leaf and physical changes, with visible cost in her metamorphosis. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Vera releases control and undergoes transformation, landing on-page.
