<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation evolves credibly from order-imposing to uncertainty-embracing, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like digging for the logbook under pressure. The final renunciation of precision is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in "she felt lighter than she had in decades."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via Mira's shift to probability, with cost felt in the ashes metaphor. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent uncertainty shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the subterranean waterfall and greenhouse guide Mira's path, and the composting soil beneath glass directly enables her discovery. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (order vs. uncertainty) escalates under causal agency through clue-following and compass handling; cost is unmistakable in her abandoned convictions. One meaningful tightening forecloses her old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through particulars like the spinning compass and dead plants, not statement; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, via the probability-clock image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—rhythmic, literary prose reflects Mira's mindset. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., clue origins) pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("gears that no longer measured time") is coherent and pressure-appropriate. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time precision and uncertainty tropes through specific, irreplaceable elements like the compass rose; risk-taking in thematic resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
