<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like pressing the seashell and choosing silence. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (silence and truth-spreading) under a causal lens, cost legible in "reed-blown melancholy," and orientation is clear early. The canyon's hunger as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the serpentine nexus and seashell constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency under the causal lens, from seeking answers to learning the harvest truth, forcing a cost-laden choice. The tightening is driven by her actions, with unmistakable cost in lost freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and the final image of silence as resistance, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the canyon's exploitation and elders' conspiracy enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic perception matching Mira's character. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., seashell whispers) is taught and paid off, enhancing rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "stars pulsed in rhythms," and propulsion remains clear through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of echo harvesting is fresh and transformed through specific detail, with risk-taking in conceptual repricing. Synthesis feels inevitable, and emotional truth elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
