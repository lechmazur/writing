<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her desire to safeguard innovation. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her laugh scattering into silence. Her final choice to plant the seed and design the new room is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like fear of loss complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera commits to the corpse flower project, foreclosing the buyout with felt cost. The seed mail inciting incident links to her decision, and the ending image of the buried seed holds conceptual cost. No causality breaks; lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like moonlight and brook sounds, filtered through Vera's POV. The mill house and brook mirror her orthogonal approaches, constraining choices. The seed as a recurring object charges the final image. Economy of detail supports momentum without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation vs. corporate takeover) escalates under causal lens through Vera's agency. The seed's symbolism deepens her resolve, leading to a tightening choice that narrows options. Cost is legible in her rejection of the buyout and commitment to patience. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the corpse flower symbolizing patience and transformation. Subtext operates through implication, like the brook's flow reflecting orthogonal approaches. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Vera's voice is lyrical and consistent. Prose reflects her mindset, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression, like "storm-born silence," enhances texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "pregnant with possibility." Minor overwriting in peak beats, but clarity and momentum are maintained. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of mystery seed mail and corpse flower metaphor, transforming familiar tropes through specific choices. The concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the reflective ending. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; authenticity of vision is clear.</comment>
