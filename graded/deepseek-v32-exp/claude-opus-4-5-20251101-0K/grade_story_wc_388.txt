<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from debunker to activist. Embodied emotions (e.g., "something cold settle in her chest") and micro-choices under pressure (reassembling letters, taking the diamond) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to spread truth is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in risking safety for redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: letters reveal stillpoint, leading to diamond discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change—Maya taking the diamond to spread truth—with felt cost in the risk and the reconfiguration of stakes, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the orchard constrains choices (respirator, Geiger counter) and charges the final image with "apples glowed faintly." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting Maya's urgency. The stillpoint threshold alters tactics, making environment integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) escalates through Maya's agency: investigating letters, intuiting conspiracy, seizing the diamond. Cost is legible in her trembling and the risk of exposing the secret. One meaningful tightening forecloses safety for action, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and healing emerges implicitly from events, not statement. The final image of "scatter it across the wasteland like seeds" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption. Subtext operates through the orchard's transformation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to Maya's observational precision. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "geiger counter screaming"). No head-hopping; elision in letter content is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("frozen lightning bolt") is precise and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with discovery, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic conspiracy with eco-hope in a non-obvious way. The stillpoint and diamond are transformed through specific details, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
