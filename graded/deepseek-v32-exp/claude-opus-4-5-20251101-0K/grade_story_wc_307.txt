<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's backward aging and Vara's patient pursuit are embodied through specific micro-choices; Vara's final understanding is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in Elowen's grief and impending vanishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Vara reinterprets vanishing through wave interference; the causal lens holds, and cost is legible in Elowen's fading and the sycamores' witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock and magnetic grotto constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "leaves rustling in patterns" are filtered through POV and support atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vara's agency in the trance realization; cost is unmistakable in Elowen's youth and the responsibility transferred to Vara, tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence/presence emerges through the pond rings metaphor without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical control; dialogue carries subtext, and elision (e.g., trance threshold) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "river returning to its source" enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of backward aging and wave interference is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
