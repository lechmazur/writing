<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in her established trait of seeing ghosts and understanding their needs. Her decision to engage rather than observe is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the "weightless burden" she carries. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when she feels the pull in her chest and analyzes dust patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Miriam decides to engage, foreclosing passive observation with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of dust, lights, and the ghost's revelation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image of the "weightless burden" reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices through dust patterns and the hidden mainspring barrel, which charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "sick yellow light" and "peeling red paint," filtered through Miriam's professional bias. The abandoned circus office pressures tactics and supplies resources for discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Miriam's agency under the Accumulative lens, from observing dust to engaging with the ghost. The dominant stake of preserving history tightens as she decides to take the mainspring barrel, with cost legible in the "weightless burden." No coincidence resolves the conflict; her choice forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "cracks in the façade" emerges organically from events and images, such as the literal seam in the wood and the ghost's story, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Miriam's reflection on Eleanor, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Miriam's analytical observations and rhythmic prose. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision taught early (e.g., dust patterns leading to discovery). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language like "weightless burden" is effective and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentences propel momentum selectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and abandoned setting feels inevitable, with specific details elevating familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and theme.</comment>
