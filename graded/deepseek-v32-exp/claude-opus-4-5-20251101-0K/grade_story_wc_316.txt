<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kira's ego death backstory informs her authoritative stance, and Vex/Sera's contrasting motivations (analytical numbness vs. empathic overwhelm) are embodied and drive the conflict. Their final handshake is earned by Kira's diagnosis, though their binary archetypes slightly limit depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong: Kira's insight directly leads to the clones' training resolution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in their bowing and the brain's sanctuary status, anchored by the dojo's impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is indispensable, constraining choice by symbolizing transience and charging the final image. Sensory details ("churning void," "civilizations flickering") are selective and deepen theme without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under causal lens: Kira's agency forces a trade-off (training together) that forecloses custody options. Cost is legible in Vex's shattered pretense and Sera's glistening eyes, narrowing their paths meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity as fluid river emerges through particulars (clone conflict, brain as potential), not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with the image of "broken halves learning they were never meant to be whole alone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited to Kira with distinct perceptual signature ("slice through pretense"). Dialogue distinguishes Vex's sharpness and Sera's softness, though minor convergence occurs at emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high density ("history rewrote itself in endless permutations"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like Kira's diagnosis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clone custody with void setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in thematic depth (emotional numbness) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in the brain's label and dojo's role avoids template plots.</comment>
