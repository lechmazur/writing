<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her perceptive nature, driving her choices consistently. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like feeling vibrations and breath catching, and her final commitment is earned by prior causality. The attribute "sensitively perceptive" constrains actions, such as pressing her palm against stone, with visible cost in her burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Mira realizes the walls dream of being understood, with felt cost in her decision to continue the work. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through discoveries like the diaries and film. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and stone wall constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cool stone" and "filtered light" are POV-filtered and integrated into action. The environment mirrors internal states and supports the theme of memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering what walls dream about escalates through Mira's agency, such as finding the diaries and activating sensors. Cost is legible in her burden and commitment. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each discovery, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and consciousness emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the walls' dreams. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose like "walls remembered" and rhythm that heightens pressure. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under stress, with purposeful compression in moments like "Legacy's burden settled."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "echoes nested inside walls like fossils," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of echo cartography and walls dreaming is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specifics like the film negative strip deepen emotional truth. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
