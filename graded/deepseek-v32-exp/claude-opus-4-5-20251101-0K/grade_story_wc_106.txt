<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action is earned by prior causality, and the backstory integrates seamlessly to deepen her arc without flattening momentum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkage; closure is a decisive change featuring Mira's success and her mother's presence, with cost legible in the collector's dismay. Orientation is early and clear, and the structure coheres without gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald station and moonlight constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and escalate through time pressure and flower codes, driven by Mira's agency. Cost is visible in the theft's success and the orphanage payoff, with one meaningful tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of liberating beauty emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures and the final orphanage scene. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and any elision (e.g., flower codes) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of stealing illuminated moments is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
