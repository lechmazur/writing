<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her root-bound nature and anxious elation, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. Her final realization—that her anchoring role was preparation—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her rootedness. However, minor lack of overt internal contradiction in peak beats slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with strong causal linkages under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens, from the eclipsed covenant to the collective crossing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira understands her purpose, with cost legible in the final image of her straining roots. The structure is tight, with clear orientation and no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the "cobalt glade" and "overgrown hedges," filtered through Mira's POV. The glade and maze topiary clipping constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as micro-settings that pressure tactics. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under the causal lens, driven by Mira's agency in linking scars and growing the maze, narrowing options toward the intersection. Cost is visible in her rooted sacrifice and the collective leap, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses other paths. No reliance on coincidence; pressure builds through protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—roots vs. flight, collective dreaming—without moralizing, supported by subtext in scars and the maze. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the door to "landscapes no one had walked before," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable single POV and perceptual signature reflected in Mira's visionary lens. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the covenant's breaking) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "sky turned the color of bruises and promises" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes fresh concepts—root-bound visionary, eclipsed covenant, linking scars—with specificity and risk-taking that heightens stakes. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Originality is marked by non-obvious integration of elements.</comment>
