<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her logical dreamer traits and motivation to save Elise drive key turns, and the final decision to contact Geneva is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost ("weight of determination"); causal lens holds tightly from observation to action; orientation is clear early, and the altitude gauge persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains choice by enabling parallel timeline views and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Elise) escalates under causal lens via Marina's agency in bead arrangement; cost is legible in her renewed campaign, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope as an equation emerges through events and images without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the trial balloon metaphor reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice reflects Marina's physicist mind, and any elision (e.g., parallel timelines) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the pattern discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of parallel timelines and trial balloons feels inevitable; risk-taking with the grotto concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
