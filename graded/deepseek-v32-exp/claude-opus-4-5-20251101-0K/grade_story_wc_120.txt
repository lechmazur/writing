<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete details like the nautilus shell and fortune writing. Her internal conflict between hollow fortunes and chronological homesickness is embodied in micro-choices, such as climbing the spire and writing the final fortune. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her exhaustion and decision to descend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through memories and images to a resonant reconfiguration at dawn. Orientation is anchored early with Li Wei at the glass spire pre-dawn. Closure lands with cost in her exhaustion and realization that homesickness is about carrying forward, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the glass spire and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the cold glass and mirrored horizon reflect POV bias and mirror internal states. The nautilus shell and spire function as micro-settings that alter tactics and resonate at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—Li Wei's homesickness and quest for meaning—escalating under the accumulative lens through her agency in mapping memories and witnessing dawn.

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the nautilus shell and mirrored horizon, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization that homesickness is about carrying forward, without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through specific struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, reflected in selective noticing of the horizon and shell. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., the grandmother's fortune) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity in peak beats like the dawn scene. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes elements like fortune cookie writing and glass spire into a fresh, non-obvious whole that feels inevitable.
