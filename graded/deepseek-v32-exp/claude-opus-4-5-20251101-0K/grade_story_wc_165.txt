<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Marina's realization that art is "dancing with randomness" reweights control vs. chaos with felt cost; causal lens holds tightly from her calculated setups to the final image, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal arcade constrains choices through acoustics and tides, charging the final image with the bishop's glow and distorted stars; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's professional bias.</comment>
