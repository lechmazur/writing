<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to preserve wonder is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in time and emotional impact. Contradictory impulses between mechanism and mystery are shown in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens, with closure landing as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the harvest of echoes is achieved. Cost is legible in the emotional wonder and seasonal suspension, and the persistent constraint of the timer shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image through its acoustic properties and light reflections. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and integrated into action, with the environment directly shaping Elena's tactics and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting echoes) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by Elena's agency in repairing the timer and studying the cavern. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens through density increase, with cost legible in the prolonged effort and emotional revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the interplay between mechanism and wonder, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of preserved echoes. Subtext operates through gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing, and the final reweighting charges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elena's character and professional mindset. POV is stable, and rhythmic control under pressure heightens the accumulative effect without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and clear propulsion, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative lens, and peak beats maintain clarity and purpose without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic prose and the integration of mechanism with mystery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures meaning with specificity.</comment>
