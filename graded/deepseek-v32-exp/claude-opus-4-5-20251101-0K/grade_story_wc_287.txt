<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's wistful pragmatism is embodied through concrete actions like tending the garden and using the bitting gauge tooth, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., waving to the stranger) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final acceptance of cycles is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the "protected, vulnerable, alive" closure. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building to a Charged Poise closure where Marina's realization reconfigures meaning with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The rosebush's lifecycle and the bitting gauge tooth act as persistent constraints shaping tactics, and the closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (fire escape, harbor) is vividly filtered through Marina's POV and constrains choices (e.g., limited space for garden). The bitting gauge tooth and rosebush charge the final image, with sensory details (e.g., "hammered silver" water) purposeful and selective. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict over endings and connection) escalates under accumulative lens through Marina's agency (reflecting light, waving), foreclosing isolation with cost in her vulnerability. One meaningful tightening occurs when the face appears, deepening stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (light in darkness, small gestures) emerges organically from particulars like the bitting gauge tooth and rosebush cycle, with subtext in the wave and light beam. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the final image reweights prior material through "keeper of a small green kingdom."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marina, with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "coaxing life from rusted coffee cans") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., grandfather's backstory) is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural in the wave sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "quivering hush fell over the fire escape"), with zero loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("moonlight turned the water into hammered silver") is coherent and purposeful, never muddying peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (fire escape gardener, lockmaster's tool) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightening stakes. Specific details (e.g., "bitting gauge tooth") avoid template plots; transformation test passes as emotional arc is inseparable from this setting and voice.</comment>
