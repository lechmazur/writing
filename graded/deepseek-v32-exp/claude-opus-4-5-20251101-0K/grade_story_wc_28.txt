<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of carving the name is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and aching arms. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as reliving painful memories yet persisting in her mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (carving the name) and felt cost under a causal lens. The plot progresses because of Kira's motivated actions, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of her retrocognitive ability shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting (shattered sky, ancient plaza) pressures choices and charges the final image, with objects like the tessera and stepping stone constraining actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kira's POV, and integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under the causal lens, from touching the tessera to carving the name, with cost legible in emotional and physical toll. The dominant stake (preserving empathy) tightens through her choices, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and empathy. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the carved name reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Kira, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and any elision (e.g., memory visions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, and the final image is sharp and undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The retrocognitive premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, with a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
