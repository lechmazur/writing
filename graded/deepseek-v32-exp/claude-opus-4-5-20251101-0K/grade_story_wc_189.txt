<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict dramatized through her realization of confusing study with living. Elena's shift from anger to openness is earned through the conversation, and micro-choices like sharing the cicada reveal hierarchy of values. No significant weaknesses; closure choice is motivated with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's admission and Elena's response, under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through the tangential approach. The persistent constraint of time/transitions shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the grotto and tidal pools constraining choices and charging the final image through thematic resonance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting Mira's POV. No generic or static description; environment actively mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through Mira's indirect answers and admission. Cost is legible in her confession of failure and the budding reconciliation. One meaningful deepening reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery (cicada, pools) and subtext in gestures, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of time and healing, reweighting prior material. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical, observational prose matching Mira's character. Dialogue carries subtext and natural rhythm. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., the pause) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language purposeful and clear. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of time themes with family drama, grounded in specific details like the cicada and grotto. Tropes are transformed through character choices, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
