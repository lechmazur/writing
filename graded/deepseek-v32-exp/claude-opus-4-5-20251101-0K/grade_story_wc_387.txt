<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirelle's motivation to appreciate hidden effort is clear and consistent, driving her actions; her interiority is concrete with embodied details like calluses and pattern-tracking. The final choice to keep discoveries secret is earned through prior causality, with cost in unseen labor. However, contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, building through sensory patterns to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where firefly interaction crystallizes theme. Closure lands with cost in unwitnessed grace, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks, but slight ambiguity in lens persistence near midpoint caps potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices: parapet whispers guide observation, bamboo whisk alters firefly paths, and rain-dripped gargoyles anchor atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the whisk are indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) escalates via Mirelle's agency—whistling prompts firefly response, narrowing options through revealed patterns. Cost is legible in her renunciation of recognition. Under accumulative lens, deepening is driven by protagonist choice, though pressure remains quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically through images (nets, fireflies, grandmother's whisk) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via firefly orchestration, reweighting prior material. Subtext in gestures and silence avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—philosophical, pattern-oriented voice. Rhythm controls pressure peaks, and elision (e.g., withheld theories) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language integrates seamlessly (e.g., "orchestra of infinitesimal lanterns"). Minor register drift in "scintillatingly somber" slightly impacts peak beats, but clarity untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hidden patterns and communication feels inevitable, with risk in quiet, contemplative style. Specific details (moon paths, net-mending) avoid tropes. Transformation test passed, but familiarity of "unseen beauty" theme limits higher innovation.</comment>
