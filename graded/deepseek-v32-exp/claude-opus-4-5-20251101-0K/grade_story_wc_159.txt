<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is crystal clear and deeply rooted in her grief, driving the narrative with embodied emotion. Her "gently systematic" precision and the ritualistic action reveal character under pressure, culminating in an earned emotional release. The final choice to continue her work, despite the cost, feels inevitable and resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the restoration of names reconfigures grief into hope. The cost is legible in Mira's tears and the library's transformed atmosphere. Orientation is immediate, and the structure coheres through lyrical accumulation toward the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal library and glass orchids are not just vivid backdrops but constrain choices and charge the final image, as seen when the orchids "hold it safe until the end of memory." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with the setting actively shaping the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (preserving forgotten names) and escalate through Mira's agency in the restoration ritual, culminating in a felt cost—her weeping—that reweights the narrative. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, foreclosing mere stasis with a tangible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the cracked bamboo and glass orchids, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss through the image of names taking root, recharging prior material with complexity and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Mira's worldview. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "deserted marvels") enhances texture without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language that consistently serves the narrative. No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance character and atmosphere seamlessly, as in the climax where "each one materialized as a seed of light."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (memory, loss) into a fresh, inevitable whole through specific details like the "museum of extinct feelings." Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed to with emotional authenticity.</comment>
