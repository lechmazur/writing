<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion shown in trembling fingers and tears. Her social perceptivity is demonstrated through reading the sand and interacting with the old man, driving key choices. The final renunciation of fear for understanding is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her emotional response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Mira's tears and the old man's softened resistance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and image to the realization that silence is an invitation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tile flake's reprise charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The whispering grotto constrains choices and supplies resources, with sensory details like mist and damp stone woven into action. The mandala and tile flake function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Specificity is high, and the environment directly shapes the climax through acoustic properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, from creating the mandala to the tile flake humming and voice emergence. Cost is unmistakable in her tears and the reconfiguration of meaning. The dominant stake of discovering meaning tightens through these beats, foreclosing the path of fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that silence is an invitation, not destruction. Subtext operates through image and implication, such as the mandala's patterns, avoiding moralizing. The conceptual repricing reweights prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with the old man. Purposeful compression, like "lilac-soft," is taught and paid off in the voice's color speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "mist curled like breath held too long." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, and clarity is maintained even under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise of emergent hush offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes, transformed through specific grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
