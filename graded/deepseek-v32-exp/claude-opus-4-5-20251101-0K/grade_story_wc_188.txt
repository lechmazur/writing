<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to transform grief into light is earned by prior causality, and the relationship with her grandmother adds crucible pressure. Minor hairline slip in the emotional arc's tidiness, but closure cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from arrival to climax. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the fireworks scene, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the fortress and mosaics constraining choices by guiding Elara to the message and tower. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of light and smoke.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict with grief escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens, from finding the message to the fireworks display. Cost is legible in the transformation of memory into light, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into beauty emerges through concrete actions and symbols like the knot and fireworks, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of smoke and light, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with clear propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor hairline slip in occasional lushness, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and spectacle feels inevitable, with specific details like the kerosene knot and mosaics. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through lived experience.</comment>
