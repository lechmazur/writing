<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in unique traits (copper veins, texture translation). Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in hands trembling. Final choice to use the diamond is earned, but internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: language resurrected, diamond shattered, and task ahead. Accumulative lens holds with pattern-building through birds and echoes. Cost is legible in diamond's destruction and felt weight of responsibility. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with bone towers and canyon echoes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as birds as "living algorithms." Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrecting language) escalates through protagonist's agency with diamond and birds. Cost is visible in diamond shattering and ongoing task. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though escalation is gradual without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and translation emerges through particulars like bird patterns and echoes, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in imagery (e.g., "frozen screams") enriches resonance, but theme leans slightly abstract in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature (e.g., "texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey"). Elision (e.g., bird patterns) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose reflects character's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "eternal echoes") but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing unique elements (copper veins, bone towers, language resurrection) with specificity. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, and closure is charged.</comment>
