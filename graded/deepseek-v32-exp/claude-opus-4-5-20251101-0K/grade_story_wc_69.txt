<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority is concretely embodied through her resignation and hope, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the zither rosette) revealing her values. Darius's return is motivated by his father's memory and personal growth, creating a crucible relationship that forces Margaret's decision to teach. The final choice to pass on knowledge is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the program's end, but no diagnostic label-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Margaret and Darius begin playing, defying silence with cost legible in "a small defiance against the silence." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of vanishing arts deepening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraint of budget cuts shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the velvet library and autumn leaves mirroring internal states. The zither rosette functions as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image through its recurring symbolism. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving art escalates through Darius's request, driven by Margaret's agency in deciding to teach. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift at ending reweights stakes with cost in the "slow work of preservation." No coincidence; tension operates at sentence and story scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing arts emerges through particulars like the zither and choir, with subtext in silence and gesture. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of teaching, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Margaret's voice is lyrical yet grounded. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (e.g., Darius's admission of hatred). Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "silences were fuller than others"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates at closure, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vanishing arts and community harmony feels inevitable, with specific details like the Suzhou rosette. Tropes of teacher-student dynamics are transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
