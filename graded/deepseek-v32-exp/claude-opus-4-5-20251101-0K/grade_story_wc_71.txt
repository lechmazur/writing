<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her to test her grandmother's theory. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like moving objects. The final realization—that attention sanctifies space—is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her commitment to continue the work. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Marina understands that "the trying itself was the sanctification," reweighting the premise with cost legible in her carrying the orris root "like a compass." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The closure unit lands on-page with felt cost, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like "violet hour" and "scent of warming mud," filtered through Marina's POV. The orris root and abandoned houses constrain choices and charge the final image, with the bay's environment influencing tone and action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—escalates through Marina's agency in displacing objects and paying attention. Under the Accumulative lens, a meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes her noticing kindles life, with cost legible in her commitment to continue. Pressure coheres and grows, driven by protagonist choices, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: attention as sanctification, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like moving objects and the "shard of hush." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the orris root as a "compass," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marina's poetic noticing. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "the house exhaled around her," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and legible at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "streetlights daydreamed their amber glow," without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure is undulled by artifacts. Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiarity through specific, grounded choices: noticing as a form of sanctification. Trope of abandoned houses is transformed via character-driven attention and object displacement. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
