<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—photographing the last darkness—is earned by her backstory and the stakes, with visible cost in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws are absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with the photograph preserving darkness as a decisive change. The persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV, and the environment constrains choices (e.g., the summit climb timing). The recurring vial of sand charges the final image, enhancing specificity and atmosphere without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving darkness) escalates under the Accumulative lens through the ticking clock and satellite grid, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the irreversible loss, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss vs. progress emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the vial and chemical photography. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; prose reflects character's mind under pressure, with purposeful compression and clear elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and read-aloud test passes with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of space-age progress and personal loss, with specific details like chemical photography transforming tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
