<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique gift, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting uncertainty. No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels; internal conflict is dramatized through phantom dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's embrace of uncertainty. Hybrid drive lens holds, dominant at end as Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early; causality is tight with meaningful tightening from seeking to understanding to choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The bunker and seal constrain choices and charge the final image; atmosphere of "ethereal grit" integrates with theme. No generic descriptors; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between control and surrender) escalates under Hybrid lens through Mira's agency. Cost is legible in her decision to "walk with the paths," foreclosing mastery with visible trade-off. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the decaying directive and broken seal. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's acceptance of uncertainty, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and precise, reflecting Mira's mindset. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., dream guidance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise and elegant with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is effective and coherent, e.g., paths "hungry in the way rivers are hungry." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, advancing story without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, transforming tropes through specific details like phantom timelines as invitations. Risk-taking in thematic resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and originality feel inevitable.</comment>
