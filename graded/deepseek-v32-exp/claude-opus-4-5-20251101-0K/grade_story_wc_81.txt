<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from curiosity to verified truth. Her tranquilly perceptive nature is embodied in micro-choices like using the blackout to explore, and her final commitment to updating records earns its cost through prior causality. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, with concrete details like feeling the stamp's grooves, though contradictory impulses are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Maren's reclaimed stillness and updated index. The accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by sensory details and pattern breaks like the hidden compartment reveal. Orientation is clear early, and causality tightens through the blackout opportunity and ledger discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-driven, with the sunken library's darkness enabling key discoveries. The bioluminescent kelp and reinforced domes constrain choices and charge the final image of Maren working amid restored hums. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Maren's agency, as the blackout deepens her investigation and the ledger revelation forecloses earlier hypotheses. Cost is legible in her altered perspective and permanent stillness. One meaningful tightening suffices, though secondary conflict with scholars is off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stamp's reweighted meaning and Celia's legacy, offering a resonant answer on truth without moralizing. Subtext operates in images (e.g., kelp light dimming) and Maren's realization. The ending reprices verification as a quiet, enduring act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Maren's perceptual signature shaping syntax and rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., prose breathes in stillness, accelerates in discovery). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., scholars fleeing) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, with sentences advancing multiple roles (e.g., "the stillness around her no longer felt like absence but like presence"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements (sunken city, librarian) with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through Maren's method and the stamp's true origin. Emotional truth arises from grounded details, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
