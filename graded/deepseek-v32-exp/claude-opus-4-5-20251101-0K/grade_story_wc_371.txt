<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's characterization is deeply rooted in her role as a "creeping normality noticer," with interiority that shows her evolution from rage to gentleness through concrete micro-choices like planting seeds. Her final act of whispering the bakery's name is an earned endurance that forecloses other paths with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No diagnostic label-speak or stock emotions; contradictions are embodied in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mei's continued planting reweights the stake against erasure with felt cost in her isolation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the spider's patient work in the final image charges the closure. Cost is legible in the whispered name and the garden's uncertain future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the tea house and courtyard constraining choices (e.g., planting near the eastern wall) and charging the final image through sensory details like frost on wild roses. Objects like the bread and seeds are micro-settings that shape tactics and reflect Mei's internal state. Specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting memory erasure escalates through Mei's agency under the Accumulative lens, with planting seeds as a deepening that narrows options and incurs cost in her persistence. The bread offering and seed-planting represent a meaningful tightening that forecloses passive acceptance, and cost is legible in her whispered words and the garden's fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding sacred in the ordinary emerges organically from particulars like the bread's "ghost of sweetness" and the spider's geometry, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mei's refusal to participate in forgetting, reweighting prior material with ambiguity. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that biases observation toward gradual change. Voice is poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity (e.g., "heuristically gentle" reflects learned patience). No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("ghost of its original sweetness") is consistent and clarity-focused. No scaffolding or template cadence; closure image is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of "guerrilla gardening" against creeping normality, with specific details like the Chen Family Bread wrapper grounding the concept. Emotional truth avoids templates, and the core premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
