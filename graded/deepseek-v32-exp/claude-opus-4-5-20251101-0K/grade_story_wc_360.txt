<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand emotion through mathematics is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like tracing type. The final realization of transposed empathy is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her empty search with visible cost in the dissolved stars and her renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing as Mira's epiphany reweights emotion from formula to harmony, with cost legible in the vanishing stars and her trembling hands. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the halo fragment's pulse drives the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Topaz workshop and vanishing stars constrain choices by imposing time pressure and charge the final image of fractured light. Sensory details like "cold and certain" metal type are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in understanding emotion escalates under accumulative lens through halo fragment use and borrowed personalities, leading to transposed empathy. Agency in her decision to continue printing books forecloses earlier paths with cost in time's asymptote and stellar dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as harmony emerges through concrete events like the halo fragment's pulses and printed equations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in borrowed personalities and disorienting books deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose like "sky hemorrhaging light." No head-hopping; elision in emotional mathematics is taught and paid off at closure with coherent voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with minimal loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "edges blurring like wet ink" serves tone without muddle, though slight overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress operation, halo fragments, and transposed empathy feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. Specific details like topaz floor and drowned poet's melancholy avoid template plots.</comment>
