<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a summoner of stillness, with interiority shown through embodied actions like trembling fingers. Her final endurance and decision to continue her work are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fatigue. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her intense concentration amid tranquility, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the prophecy hushed into harmlessness and cost legible in Mira's trembling and the transformed certainty. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is anchored early by the sanctuary and prophecy. No causality breaks; the structure is tight with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the brook and nocturnal haven constraining Mira's choice to perform her ritual there. Sensory details like "water that moved without sound" are filtered through her POV, and the environment charges the final image with the bird's song. Micro-setting elements like the origami wing are integral to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, as she actively maps silence to transform the prophecy, with cost visible in her trembling and the night-long effort. The dominant stake of preventing violence is signaled early and tightens through her concentrated work, foreclosing the option of inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between sound and silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the "gift of uncertainty." Subtext operates in images like the origami wing and the brook's journey, avoiding moralizing. The concept of smoothing hush is integrated without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's lyrical, attentive voice. Rhythmic control is evident under pressure, such as in the description of her consciousness flowing. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure. Prose reflects her solitary craft with consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "tranquil blaze" is coherent and purposeful, and read-aloud flow is smooth. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; line-level craft is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of hushing prophecies through stillness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the origami wing and terrestrial-cosmic connection heighten stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in the quiet climax pays off with conceptual integrity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
