<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ezra's characterization is deeply rooted in his profession and inherent stubbornness, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative forward; his final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his weariness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear causal chain from the package's arrival to the closure where Ezra finds peace, with orientation established early and cost legible in "the exhaustion in his bones felt earned rather than endless"; the lens persists as a constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid settings like the mortuary and underwater library are filtered through Ezra's POV, with the lens and impossible spaces constraining choices and charging the final image of the restored lens on the shelf.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ezra's agency in helping the souls over seven nights, with unmistakable cost in his deepening weariness and purpose under the causal lens; his choices narrow options and reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving rest and finding stillness emerges through concrete actions and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "some things must be buried before they can be kept" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature in notes like "geometry bent like grief," and rhythmic control under pressure, without head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or scaffold; slight poetic density in peaks like "fractured rainbows across the faces of the dead" does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and well-executed, with specific synthesis of undertaker and underwater library tropes, and risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
