<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's grief is embodied through specific actions like calloused fingers and halted craft, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., folding cranes) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from numbness to teaching is earned by prior causality, though the shift feels slightly swift; however, the cost of enduring grief is visible in her refusal to measure time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Elara's realization "illuminated everything" and the new visitor). Causality is clear from grief to community building, and cost is legible in her carried grief. Orientation is anchored early with the observatory and backstory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (timelessness aids healing) and charging the final image with starlight. Sensory details (e.g., "cracked dome," "dust motes") are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with grief) escalates under accumulative lens through Elara's agency in teaching and folding cranes, deepening her healing. Cost is visible in her emotional shifts and the community's growth, though escalation is gradual rather than tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief transforming into purpose emerges organically through images (chrysanthemum to constellation, withering to bloom) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final visitor and Elara's knowledge, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "slow rotation of stars," "genuinely artificial"). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and elision (e.g., benefactor's mystery) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation (e.g., "The curtains of intention parted again, letting in another sliver of light"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, observatory, and origami cranes feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the core premise is transformed through grounded details like the vellum stencil.</comment>
