<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's patience and dedication are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing knots for hours). Her final decision to find the weavers is earned by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira's realization reconfigures options. Cost is legible in "she would not let that happen" and her stiff joints. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (golden dock, fog, snow) constrains choice by isolating Mira and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "snow fell in silence," "rough fibers"). Micro-setting (rope) functions as environment that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under accumulative lens: decoding knots deepens stakes from preservation to invitation. Cost is unmistakable in her commitment to act. One meaningful tightening (the final sequence as test) forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (preservation through transformation) emerges from particulars (seeds, knots, fulgurite) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "chaos made permanent." No moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, patient rhythm). Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "oceanic hush" to decisive resolve). No head-hopping; elision (fog) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "philosophical arguments made tangible"). Read-aloud test passes; no register drift or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed collector and knot decoding feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes. Specific details (fulgurite, forgotten species) avoid template plots. Transformation test passed; no derivative echoes.</comment>
