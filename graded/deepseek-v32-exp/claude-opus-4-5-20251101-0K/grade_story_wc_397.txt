<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her changed perception post-stroke, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between euthanasia and newfound purpose is shown simultaneously, not alternating. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, though the stroke's abruptness slightly limits flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in the final image of waiting as living. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of ice and patience deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the closure unit reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains choices (e.g., trawling) and charges the final image with its groaning sound. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (life/death uncertainty) escalates under Accumulative lens through volunteering and reflection, driven by Maren's agency. Cost is legible in her suspended state, foreclosing the Zurich path. One meaningful tightening occurs, but external pressure is mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience and survival emerges through particulars like the parasol tip and ice imagery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise of waiting. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., stroke details) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in descriptions (e.g., "windborne solace") doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes euthanasia tourism with Arctic setting in a non-obvious way, transformed through specific detail. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes. No derivative echoes.</comment>
