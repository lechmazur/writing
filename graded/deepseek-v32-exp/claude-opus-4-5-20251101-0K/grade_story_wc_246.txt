<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with interiority shown through embodied actions like tracing equations. Her "confidently uncertain" trait drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final decision to send the correction is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as the Kepler sun brightens, under a causal lens. The anomaly's time distortion enables a logical, earned resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "time folded like wet paper." Setting is integral to tactics and closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate when Vera receives the Kepler question, leading to her agency-driven decision to send the correction. Cost is legible in the changed starlight and her emotional reconfiguration, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through interpretation emerges organically from events, with subtext in the pen and anomaly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending scientific and personal tones. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., time distortion) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "starlight arrived centuries late" enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of time anomaly and personal guilt feels fresh and inevitable, with specific details like the iridium pen. Risk-taking in nonlinear time heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
