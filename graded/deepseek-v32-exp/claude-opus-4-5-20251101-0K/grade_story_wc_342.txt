<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and tactile perception are consistently embodied and drive her actions; her micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the coin and creating the drawing, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization that "blindness becomes a different kind of sight" is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the library's impending destruction. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost—the library's destruction and Elara's insight that limits are "doorways"—under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. The coin's coordinates drive causality, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of her blindness shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image through sensory details like "starlight filtered through in calculated constellations." Sensory selection reflects Elara's touch-based POV, and the condemned environment pressures her urgency. The setting's evolution with the dawn demolition reinforces the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving knowledge escalates through Elara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from decoding the coin to creating the drawing. Cost is legible in the "weight of condemned air" and the library's loss, narrowing options. The tightening forecloses live paths with visible price, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of limits as doorways emerges organically from particulars like Elara's perception and the scholars' theorem, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carrying secrets forward. Subtext operates in gestures like her touch, though the final paragraphs edge toward explicitness without breaking resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on tactile and geometric perception. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in descriptions like "fractally precise patterns" is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "landscapes of texture" is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor purple tendencies in peak beats do not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes face blindness with portrait artistry and a tree library in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details like the coin's tactile map feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
