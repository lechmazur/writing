<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to translate silence into music is concretely embodied through her actions with the camera and backstory, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., guiding Elena). Elena's exhaustion and role as advisor are shown but could be more deeply embodied; however, their relationship serves as a crucible that forces meaningful choices. The final decision to teach is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the "joyful sorrow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "joyful sorrow" and harbor's music finding an audience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building patterns of silence and mapping. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is coherent from Elena's request to Mira's teaching. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "liquid silver" and vibrations filtered through Mira's POV. The camera functions as micro-setting, altering tactics. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the harbor) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through Mira's agency in teaching Elena. Cost is legible in their shared emotion and the harbor's fate. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena gains new knowledge, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and music emerges from particulars like Mira's camera and parents' vibrations, with subtext in gestures and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Signed dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., camera's emptiness) is taught and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Minor cliché in "bloomed" slightly reduces peak beat clarity, but overall propulsion is strong. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with clean syntax and punctuation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of deafness, silence mapping, and empty camera feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes. Specific details like vibrations from music anchor emotional truth. Tropes are transformed through grounded character choices, and the premise is fresh and non-obvious.</comment>
