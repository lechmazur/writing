<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in past experiences, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final hopeful stance is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the town's unspoken doubts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost felt in the hope and impending rebellion. The accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with a meaningful transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (magnetic grotto affects chess use) and charges the final image with starlight and mist. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebellion against testing) escalates through Eleanor's agency in organizing displays, with cost legible in the hope and town's awakening. Pressure tightens under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess metaphors and unspoken words, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of hope. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision (e.g., hearing unspoken words) is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language supports pressure, and rhythm varies naturally, though slightly ornate in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of elements (hearing unspoken words, magnetic grotto, quiet rebellion), transforming tropes through specific choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
