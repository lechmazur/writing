<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply rooted in her profession and personal history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict about her marriage is shown through concrete actions, and her final decision to contact Marcus is earned by the discovery of the shells, with visible cost in her emotional shift. The quick test is satisfied: contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through Elena's discoveries to a resonant reconfiguration closure. The decision to reach out to Marcus lands on-page with felt cost in her chest shift and the pearl warming. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the shells acting as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elena's professional observations and emotional reflections.
