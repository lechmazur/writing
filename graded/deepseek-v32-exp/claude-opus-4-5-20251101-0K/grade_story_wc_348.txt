<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and professional identity, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final shift from preventing loss to honoring connections is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her transformed work. Internal conflict is shown in scene, not summary, and the chrysalis object constrains choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira finds peace through generative work, with cost legible in the final image of the shimmering membrane. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of foam and chrysalis. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and structure transitions smoothly from ravine to lab.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Settings like the braided ravine and lab are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The ravine and chrysalis constrain choices and charge the final image, influencing her insight and polymer design. Economy is strong, with details integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's internal conflict between grief and creation, escalating through her insight at the ravine and lab work. Under accumulative lens, pressure builds via pattern recognition, and agency drives the escalation with cost legible in her transformed approach. One meaningful tightening forecloses her old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through separation emerges organically from images like the chrysalis and foam, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the polymer membrane, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication and gesture, such as the chrysalis as a record of change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and emotional registers. Voice modulates under pressure, and prose reflects Mira's mind without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in reflective moments is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports emotional beats, and word choice is specific without thesaurus-itis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of polymer chemistry, grief, and natural patterns feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending science and emotion. Specific details like the chrysalis and foam transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth and authenticity elevate the narrative beyond template plots.</comment>
