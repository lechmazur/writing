<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, with embodied emotion shown through ripple-marks and tactile interactions. Her internal conflict between old knowledge and new reality is concrete, though contradictory impulses are more summarized than simultaneously acted upon in scene. The final choice to map the chamber is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Vera's "earned exhaustion" and decision to guide others. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the bloom of hush discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as ice cracks guiding Vera's descent. The harmonic caves and bloom of hush constrain actions and charge the final image with "pregnant" silence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Vera's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding quiet) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Vera's agency in examining ice patterns and discovering the chamber. Cost is legible in her "hammered repose" and foreclosed options. One meaningful deepening reweights the stake, though the escalation is more density-based than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the echo stone and bloom of hush, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on silence and adaptation. Subtext operates in gestures (stone pulsing, walls whispering) without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and professional lexicon. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., fractured echoes) is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with diction matching Vera's expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops. Figurative language ("ripple-mark mapkeeper," "hammered repose") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes fresh elements (energy beings, bloom of hush) with grounded specificity, avoiding tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable through character choice and world logic.</comment>
