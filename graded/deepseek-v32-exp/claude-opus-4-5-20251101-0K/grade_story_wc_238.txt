<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt and determination are embodied through micro-choices like kneeling with the apparatus; Eleanor's ghost displays contradictory impulses between lingering torment and desire for release. The final choice to use the device is earned by prior causality of his past failure, with cost visible in her liberation and the orchard's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as Eleanor frees and Marcus takes her manuscript, under a Causal lens where his actions directly lead to her release. The orchard deadline persistently constraints tactics, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sheet music archive constrains choice by housing Eleanor's unfinished work and the orchard's impending destruction charges the final image with loss. Sensory details like "dust and forgotten symphonies" are filtered through Marcus's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing Eleanor's soul escalates through Marcus's agency in using the electromagnetic method, narrowing options as the orchard deadline looms. Cost is legible in the darkness trapped in the perfume bottle and the chainsaws at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect redemption emerges through particulars like the failed exorcism and unfinished symphony, with subtext in metaphors ("space between notes"). The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through Marcus carrying the manuscript.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice ("voice like wind through hollow reeds"); dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, as in Eleanor's chiding about metaphors. No head-hopping, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "smoke from an extinguished candle." No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism with electromagnetic mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight; tropes are transformed through specific details like the gossip-column backdrop and imperfect miracles, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
