<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to create a plan is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise, reconfiguring Maya's stance with felt cost of decay. Accumulative lens holds strong, with orientation clear early and causality intact. The persistent constraint of the terminal's decay shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting that pressures choices and charges the final image. The terminal's decay and engineering details are POV-filtered and essential, with objects like the sextant and drains constraining actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes of revival escalate through Maya's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the silence and her determination. However, cost isn't visceral, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope through navigation emerges naturally from symbols and actions, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the maze metaphor. No moralizing, earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct engineer's perceptual signature and controlled rhythmic prose. No head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, with propulsion maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements with engineering focus, specific details like the sextant, and emotional authenticity. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
