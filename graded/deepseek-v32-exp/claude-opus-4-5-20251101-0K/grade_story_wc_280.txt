<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Madeline's synesthetic perception and ghostly longing are concretely embodied, with her decision to help the woman arising from established traits. The final shift to finding purpose in encores is earned through on-page causality, with visible cost in her acceptance of lost applause. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Madeline reconfigures her purpose, with cost legible in "The applause would never return." The hybrid drive lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds, and the orchard's fractured timeline persistently shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden constrains choice by enabling the echo productions, charging the final image beneath the apple tree. Sensory details like "indigo waves" of despair are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the maze and tree anchoring the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Madeline's agency in producing echoes, tightening the stakes from personal despair to transformative help. Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of applause for a new purpose. Under the hybrid lens, pressure coheres through accumulative deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from echoes of transformation, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to despair through Madeline's charged poise. No moralizing; subtext operates in the tarot coin and overlapping timelines. Emotional aftereffect lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia. Dialogue in echoes feels natural and goal-driven. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; elision in timeline fractures is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "crimson and gold" swells is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and synesthetic magic feels inevitable, with risk-taking in fractured timeline structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the tarot coin avoid tropes; emotional truth avoids generic templates. Transformation test passed.</comment>
