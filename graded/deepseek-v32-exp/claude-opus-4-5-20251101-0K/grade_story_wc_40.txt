<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies from academic curiosity to desperate necessity, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., recording crystal echoes). Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitary vigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (realization that language grows like trees, charging her hope), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the final image makes cost legible through her solitary faith.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the library and crystal constraining choices and charging the final image (e.g., crystal splintering light). Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding language growth) escalate through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening in her realization. Cost is legible in her endured solitude, and the closure reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic dormancy and hope emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in echoes and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of scattered light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., fractured sequences). No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion in peak beats (e.g., "The crystal sang back its testimony").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of linguistic stasis and growth, with specific, grounded choices in character and object use. Risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
