<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied through synesthetic nerve regeneration, with internal conflict dramatized in her choice between safety and song. Her final decision to turn the bolt is earned by prior causality, including the bellhop's message and her grandmother's legacy, with visible cost in risking the storms. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her hesitation balanced by hope, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change as Mira begins to turn the bolt, breaking the silence with felt cost (potential return of storms) under a causal lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the bellhop's dust message and bolt discovery create because/therefore linkages that narrow options. Cost is legible in the final image of "frost-touched hope."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress setting pressures choices through its silence mechanism and snow-bound isolation, with sensory details like "frost had crept across its black surface like veins of silver" filtering through Mira's POV. The piano bench bolt functions as a micro-setting that constrains her choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety versus expression escalates under the causal lens through Mira's agency: discovering the message, interpreting the bolt, and deciding to act. The cost is legible in her risk of ending the protection, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of passive endurance. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence's cost emerges through particulars like the dust message and piano bolt, with subtext in gestures and implications. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Mira chooses faith over frostbitten hope, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through her struggle and the bellhop's silent pleas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic descriptions like "pain translated into colors." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and the bellhop's non-verbal communication carries subtext. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., dust messages) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "a bruise that refused to heal" is purposeful and consistent. No register drift or muddle in peak beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of silence-as-currency with synesthetic experience, transforming tropes through specific details like nerve regeneration and dust messages. Risk-taking in lyrical prose and non-verbal communication heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices charging closure.</comment>
