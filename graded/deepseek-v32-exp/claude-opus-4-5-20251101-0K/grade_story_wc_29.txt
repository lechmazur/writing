<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise; her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like feeling the subsonic hum in her teeth. Her final choice to broadcast interference is earned by prior causality, showing a hierarchy of values under pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like desperation balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; orientation is anchored by ~120 words with who, where, and when. Closure is a decisive change—Mira spoils the harvest—with felt cost in the community's confusion and her ongoing war. The midnight deadline and signal decay create a before/after shift; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the basement's burnt coffee smell and astronomical charts constraining choices. The radio station equipment pressures Mira's tactics, and sensory details reflect her urgency. Micro-setting (transmitter, charts) charges the final image of her reflection on the oscilloscope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing societal division—escalates through Mira's agency under the causal lens. The deadline and pounding door tighten options; her broadcast forces a trade-off with cost legible in the signal's decay. No coincidence; resolution earned by her alteration of the emotional payload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation vs. free will emerges through events, not statement; subtext in the tricksters' farming of discord. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Mira's continued vigilance. No moralizing; complexity arises from particulars like the emotional counter-frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's scientific bias filters perception. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "the silence that followed was the most human sound." No head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "patient as starlight." No register drift or syntactic monotony; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis—cosmic tricksters cultivating discord—transformed through specific details like historical radio records. Risk-taking in emotional manipulation heightens stakes; inevitability in hindsight. No template plots; authenticity in voice and world logic.</comment>
