<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margaret's trauma and motivation are vividly embodied through specific actions like using tuning forks and sensors, with micro-choices under pressure leading to an earned closure where she adapts to silence; no diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing weakens the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where silence is redefined as a new language; cost is legible in the final image of learning to listen with eyes, skin, and heart, anchored early in the conservatory setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like crystalline walls and frozen plants integrated into action; specificity elevates atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes around overcoming silence escalate through Margaret's agency in heat-mapping specimens, with cost visible in the thermal warmth she feels; accumulative deepening under the lens reweights options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through silence emerges organically from images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in frozen plants' resilience deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on heat and vibration; lyrical prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "spectral fragments" is purposeful, and sentences advance character and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes trauma recovery with scientific innovation in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable; risk-taking in blending heat-mapping and silence heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
