<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in survival and the quest for home, with embodied interiority like the "burning in the skull." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing symbols with the feather, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to speak and climb is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in remembering grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera speaks the language and climbs, reconfiguring meaning with cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from stone to feather to speech.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the labyrinthine bookstore constraining choices and revealing passages. Sensory detail is purposeful, like the "iridescent" feather, and the environment charges the final image. The mountain as a book integrates with theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in remembering and home escalates through Vera's agency, such as seeding knowledge with the feather. Cost is legible in the pain of recollection and effort. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and home emerges organically from events and images, like the stone and feather. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"home was not a place but a fluency." No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., forgetting) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose reflects Vera's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "mercury and memory" enhances clarity. Rhythm supports pressure, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing mercury-glass seer, forgetting plague, and lost language with emotional specificity. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
