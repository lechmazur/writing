<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance as "keeper of the flame" is earned with visible cost in the "unbearable" absence. However, contradictory impulses are not prominently dramatized in scene, slightly limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina continues her work, cost felt in "love, even unfinished, left marks." Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with causal links in discoveries like the photograph connecting to the letter. Orientation is clear from the start, and the persistent constraint of water shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices (e.g., diving into hollow columns) and charges the atmosphere with vivid sensory details like "barnacles crusted the marble benches." Setting is integrated into action and reflects internal states, such as the "drowning crown" roof mirroring Marina's themes of loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving abandoned dreams escalates through Marina's agency in discovering and connecting artifacts, reweighted by the photograph-letter reunion. Cost is unmistakable in the "interlaced absence" and emotional weight. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges organically from fragments and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "love, even unfinished, left marks." Subtext operates through artifacts and notes, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature focused on absence and memory. No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure, such as in the hushed tone of "excavating meaning." Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, high information density, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "hushed blaze" enhances clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-flood archeology with emotional depth, transforming tropes through specific details like the inkwell and notes. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
