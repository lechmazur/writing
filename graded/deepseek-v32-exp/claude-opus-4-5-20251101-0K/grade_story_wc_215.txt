<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as opening the box for the ghost. Her tranquilly perceptive nature and endurance are earned, with visible cost in the burden of silences. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise, as Maren holds the box with the weight of silences, foreclosing immediate release with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through ghostly encounters. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the scorched wasteland and beekeeping oasis pressuring Maren's isolation. The stained glass box acts as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, as ghostly encounters deepen the stake of preserving unspoken words. Cost is legible on-page when "the weight settle—another stone in the cairn." Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and unspoken words emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the silence told her everything," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is character-specific. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, with purposeful compression and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is purposeful and enhances momentum. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle on ghosts and communication, with specific details like the stained glass box transforming tropes.
