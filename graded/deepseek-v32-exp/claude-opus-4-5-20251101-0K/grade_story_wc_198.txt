<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in family history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by decades of practice, with visible cost in grief for lost generations. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (prophecy shattered) and felt cost (grief and relief), under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is early, and causality is tight, with the vested hush technique resolving the prophecy through established patterns. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the grotto and mist constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting, altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) escalates under accumulative lens through the saxophonist's agency, with a meaningful tightening as the music creates stillness. Cost is legible in the internal struggle and grief. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence and freedom emerges through events and imagery, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the shattered prophecy as beautiful and harmless. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., negative space) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prophecy and musical silence feels inevitable, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes. Core concept (vested hush) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
