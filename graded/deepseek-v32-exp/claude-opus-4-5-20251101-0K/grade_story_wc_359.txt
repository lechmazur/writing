<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meren's motivation to certify wonder is clear and rooted in her synesthesia, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like tears freezing on her cheeks. The final choice to ring the bell is earned by her seventeen-year search and the cost of the music sheet crumbling. No significant weaknesses; contradictory impulses are less prominent but the arc is coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost: the bell's sound unfetters songs and cracks the Council's certainty, a decisive change under the causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The sculpted hush acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora are vividly described with sensory detail (e.g., breath crystallizing, light prisming) and constrain choices by enabling the bell's ringing. The setting pressures Meren's actions and charges the final image of residual music. Economy of detail is purposeful, with no generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) escalates through Meren's agency in conducting the aurora, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the music sheet crumbling and the bell's permanent song altering the world. No coincidence resolves the conflict; tension operates at beat and story scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as necessity emerges through events like the bell completing the silence, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images (e.g., oscillating repose) and avoids thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia (e.g., colors humming). Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful, such as the compressed timeframe during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., "brief diamonds that scattered") is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure causality; sentence-level propulsion supports the climax. Minor overwriting in peak beats is absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of prism-song bell ringing and sculpted hush, transformed through specific details like the amber music sheet. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric closure. No template plots or derivative premises; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
