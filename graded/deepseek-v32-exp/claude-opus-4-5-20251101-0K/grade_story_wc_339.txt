<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in accumulated loss, with embodied emotion and internal conflict between analysis and grief. Her final realization is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her readiness to break through. The trait "quietly analytic" constrains choices, such as noting details to maintain detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eleanor grasps the captain's lesson and feels ready to surface, with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, integrating grief and discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposefully filtered through Eleanor's POV, with sensory details like "anemones that swayed like displaced librarians." The sunken ship library constrains choice (finding the log) and charges the final image of ascent. Micro-setting (snow globe) evolves meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates through Eleanor's agency in discovering the snow globe and captain's pages, leading to a deepening realization. Cost is legible in her emotional transformation under the accumulative lens. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges through concrete events and images (snow globe's inscription, captain's meditation) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of breaking through, reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending analytical and lyrical prose. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "her gloved hand trembled"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., backstory) is anchored in present stimuli and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("a storm captured in perpetuity") is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of deep-sea exploration and grief feels inevitable, with specific details (snow globe, Meridian log) transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is freshly charged.</comment>
