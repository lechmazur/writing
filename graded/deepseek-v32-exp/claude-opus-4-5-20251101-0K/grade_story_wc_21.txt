<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as an archivist, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like feeling "ankle-deep in black water." Her final choice to record testimony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in carrying "the weight of voices." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages: diary discovery leads to visions and journey to lagoon. Closure is a decisive change where Celeste records testimony, with cost legible in "the fierce, bittersweet knowledge." Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the obsidian lagoon constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cold porthole glass" and "dunes scroll beneath the zeppelin's shadow" are purposeful and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through protagonist agency: decoding diary, experiencing visions, and journeying to lagoon. Cost is felt in the ending as Celeste carries "the weight of voices." Meaningful tightening occurs without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges naturally from events and images, such as the parley marks and lagoon. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, through "some stories trap you only so you can finally set them free." Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "clouds the color of old bruises." Voice is consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in the parley scene. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "a wound in the earth that remembered everything" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through specific synthesis of elements like retrocognition and water-hoarding conspiracy, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in non-linear visions heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
