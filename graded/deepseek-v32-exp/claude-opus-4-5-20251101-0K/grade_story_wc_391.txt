<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her past impatience and learned patience, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization that revolution is erosion, not explosion, is earned by prior causality and backstory, with visible cost in her smile and the ice's groan. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation of immediate justice feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (ice groaning, her smile redefining revolution), under an Accumulative drive lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the magnetic viaduct discovery amplifies stakes. Persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constraining choices (viaduct amplifies signals) and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Mira's POV, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with her measurements tightening stakes toward the magnetic storm prediction. Cost is unmistakable in her past grief and the revolution's timing. One meaningful deepening suffices, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patience as revolution emerges organically from events and images (ice groaning, viaduct as bridge), without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's realization, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice remains coherent under pressure, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of celestial mapping and patient revolution, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
