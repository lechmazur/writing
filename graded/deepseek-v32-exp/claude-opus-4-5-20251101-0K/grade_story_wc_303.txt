<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role; internal conflict is embodied in the coffee stain reading and fern whispers. Her final choice to shatter the violin is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she becomes forsworn. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, e.g., weighing dream against empire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change: violin shattered, Mira forsworn, song propagated. Causal drive lens holds strong; cost is legible in "forsworn and free." Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of the fading promise glow shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the velvet observatory's acoustic dome constrains the climax by amplifying the song. Sensory details like "bruised plums" and "warm material" are filtered through Mira's POV. Micro-setting (coffee cup, ferns) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream vs. empire) escalates under causal lens through Mira's agency to propagate the song. Cost is unmistakable: violin destruction and her forsworn state. Escalation is driven by her choice, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation vs. imperialism emerges through particulars like the violin's origin and ferns' memories. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "songs that outlast empires." No moralizing; subtext in coffee stains and perforated destiny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, e.g., "mulberry ache." Dialogue with ferns is minimal but functional. No head-hopping; elision (coffee stains) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "grief made crystalline" is purposeful. Minor overwriting in "mulberry ache" slightly muddles peak beat, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (provenance researcher, ice violin, plant telepathy) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through specific grounded choices.</comment>
