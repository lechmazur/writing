<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her profession and personal history, with interiority that feels specific and earned. Her final choice to honor her grandmother's silence while preparing to reveal the truth later is a credible endurance foreclosing a path with visible cost. The quick test is satisfied: contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain from discovery to decoded confession, with closure as a Charged Poise—Mira's resolved stance reconfigures options with felt cost. The inferred causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is anchored early. Cost is legible in the final image of her carrying "forty-two years of love finally translated."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail and actively pressures choices, such as the volcanic heat and breathing stone influencing Mira's actions. It charges the final image by mirroring her internal transformation. The quick test is met: the environment constrains choice and deepens closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the causal lens from personal curiosity to moral dilemma, driven by Mira's agency in decoding the letter. The cost of her silence is palpable in the trade-off between truth and protection. One meaningful tightening—the revelation of the consortium's threat—narrows options convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically through the grandmother's sacrifice and Mira's calibrated restraint, avoiding direct statement. The ending reweights prior material with a resonant, non-literal answer: "compassion could be encrypted in the strangest places." Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her engineering background. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., the decoding process) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "stone still breathes" is purposeful. Information density is high, advancing character and plot without padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering precision with moral calculus feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of encrypted compassion transforms a familiar redemption arc through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in structural elision heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
