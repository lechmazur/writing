<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decision to finish the sketch before addressing the ship. Her motivation to turn confusion into exploration is consistent and intensifies, compelling her higher-stakes choice to prioritize her purpose over potential rescue. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her acceptance of solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mira redefines solitude as her compass, with felt cost in her renunciation of conventional rescue. The Accumulative drive lens holds, building through her sketches and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "cold glass" and "stars that moved imperceptibly slower" filtered through Mira's POV. Setting is woven into action, affecting her perception and tactics, and mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, as the ship's approach tests her commitment to her purpose, forcing a trade-off with cost legible in her choice to sketch first. The dominant stake of internal conflict between solitude and exploration tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is subtle rather than sharply causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the compass rose and sketching custom, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to finding purpose in isolation. Subtext operates through implication, such as "true north" reweighting prior material without moralizing, and the ending image reconfigures meaning with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a perceptual signature that reflects Mira's temporally stretched experience, such as "each beat a sustained drumroll." POV distance is controlled, and prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("temporal-patient fingers") slightly strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, but minor register drift in phrases like "temporal-patient fingers" causes slight artifice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise of a blessed pariah in a time-dilation setting is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the star atlas and family custom. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
