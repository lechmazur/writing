<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in discovering meaning in the margins. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like pressing the clipboard to her chest. The final reaffirmation of her routine is an Earned Stasis with visible cost, though lacking major internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens, with Vera's continued work charging the theme of nostalgia. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of her returning each dawn. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The golden arcade setting constrains choices through the chalk marks and fountain, and charges the final image with dawn light turning it into a "cathedral." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Vera's POV and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of helping escapes escalates through Vera's agency in reading codes and creating pseudonyms. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with the ritual, and cost is legible in the thirty-day wait and deliberate slowness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia and meaning in margins emerges through events like chalk codes and surface mail, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the child playing chalk games, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in the description of the arcade. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language like "cathedral of amber and gold" is purposeful, though minor purple prose exists. Closure image remains clear and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pseudonym creation, chalk codes, and surface mail feels inevitable, with specific details grounding the concept. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
