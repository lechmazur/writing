<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., adjusting to cold mirroring her glasswork) and a final renunciation of commodified art earned by prior causality. The cost is visible in her decision to abandon commissions, fulfilling the quick test with contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (Elena's new artistic direction) under the accumulative/textural lens, reinforced by frost pattern decoding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of "seeds of light." The lens holds without ambiguity, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting constrains choice through cold and isolation, while frost patterns charge the final image by enabling the ledger decoding. Sensory details (e.g., "crystalline patterns like white fire") are selective and POV-filtered, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency in decoding the ledger, tightening stakes from survival to artistic independence under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in her foreclosed path of working for patrons, with one meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (frost patterns, ledger decoding) without moralizing, offering a resonant answer on beauty's independence. The final image of "seeds of light" reweights prior material, avoiding abstraction and fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature ("glass-sharp light that scattered into rainbow fragments"). Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and any elision (e.g., patron's death) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("molten gold" light) is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the decoding moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of glass art, frost mathematics, and smuggler codes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar themes.</comment>
