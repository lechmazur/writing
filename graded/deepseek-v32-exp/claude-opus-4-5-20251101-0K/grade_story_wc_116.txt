<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to witness without judgment is clear and consistent, embodied in micro-choices like handling the origami swan. Her endurance feels earned, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies. The final acceptance of becoming part of the silence has visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as Earned Stasis—Maren's renunciation forecloses intervention with cost in "she would become part of the accumulated silence." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens coheres without ambiguity, with the origami swan's method shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices like burrowing deeper and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "moss softened the spines") are selective and POV-filtered. The overgrown library acts as micro-setting, altering tactics and supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of witnessing versus disturbing escalate through accumulative density, driven by Maren's agency in learning from the swan. Cost is legible in her loosened grip on certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when she integrates the swan's method, narrowing options under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through particulars like the decaying books and origami swan, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the image of "crumbling peace." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, measured prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "She gripped reality loosely." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("dripped constellations") is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting accumulation without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of decay and witness, with specific details like the origami swan encoding method. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
