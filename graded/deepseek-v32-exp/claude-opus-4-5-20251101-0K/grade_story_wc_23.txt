<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure driving her actions. Her internal conflict between grief and purpose is shown through specific, contradictory impulses, such as staying at the station despite the evacuation. The final choice to build the beacon is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her raw hands and shifted grief. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Mira realizes her role in guiding lost souls, reconfiguring her grief into presence. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns like the phone calls and moon phases building to this moment. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of lights gathering. The persistent constraint of the failed hydraulics shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral, with the signal station and objects like the censer foot constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mira's POV, such as the sea's churn and the stars' indifference. The environment actively shapes the narrative, providing salvaged materials for the beacon and mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens, with the dominant stake of navigating loss deepening through cryptic phone calls and the beacon's construction. Mira's agency drives the escalation, as her decisions to record messages and build the array foreclose other paths with visible cost. The cost is felt in her trembling hands and the transformation of grief, charging the final image without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration and transforming grief emerges organically from events and images, such as the censer foot's return and the beacon's creation. Subtext operates through implication in phone calls and objects, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of returning lights, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mira's navigator background and grief. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure, as in "starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams." Dialogue from phone calls is natural and advances plot through subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "geography of loss," is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Syntax and diction reflect Mira's state under stress, with concise, image-driven lines. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of reverse migration is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of supernatural and emotional elements, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyrical and accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, as seen in the phone calls and beacon construction. Specificity in details like the censer foot and moon phases anchors universals. Transformation of tropes through grounded character choices ensures originality.</comment>
