<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is deeply rooted in her brother's death, with embodied grief and consistent micro-choices under pressure, such as using the dental mirror and shutters to communicate. Her silence and actions reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final stance of continued vigil is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The boy's presence triggers a credible emotional response, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the boy's departure and the guardian's enduring vigil reconfigure meaning through the accumulative/textural lens. The drive lens holds consistently, with patterns of light and silence building to a decisive change in attention. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur; the final image of "darkness could hold beauty" charges the ending with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (e.g., "cobalt dock," "water pooled between warped planks") that constrains choice—the dock and shutters enable the guardian's actions. The environment pressures tactics and charges the final image, with micro-setting elements like the dental mirror and light patterns integral to the narrative arc. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, using light patterns to deepen stakes and shift the boy's focus from despair to hope. The cost is legible in her continued vigil and the boy's transformed attention, foreclosing a path with visible emotional trade-offs. Pressure coheres and tightens through a single meaningful intensification without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images—silence, empathy, and darkness as canvas—without direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the guardian's reflection on "how we chose to live with them," reweighting prior material with purposeful ambiguity. Subtext operates in gestures and light patterns, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that filters setting through the guardian's grief-stricken lens. Prose rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "spiralingly calm") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; internal voice remains coherent under pressure, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "like a bruise healing"), and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; the final image lands with poetic precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes of grief and guardianship through a fresh, non-obvious angle—silent empathy expressed via light patterns. Specific details like the dental mirror and shutter mechanics feel organic and irreplaceable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in structure and tone coheres, and the closure effect is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
