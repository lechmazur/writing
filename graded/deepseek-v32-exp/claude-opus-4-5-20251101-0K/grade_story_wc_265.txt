<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rediscover her mind is clear and drives key choices; interiority is embodied (e.g., "ache of displacement"), and her final act of healing the tree is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. curiosity) act in scene, and the resolution forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the tree's song reshapes neural pathways, under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of straying as discipline shapes tactics. The final image reconfigures boundaries with conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "copper leaves," "brass trees") that constrain choice—the mechanical rainforest pressures Mira's actions and the gear charges the final healing image. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscovering the mind's frontier) escalates under the Accumulative lens via Mira's agency in healing the tree, narrowing options with cost (losing the talisman). Pressure coheres and tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of straying as discipline emerges through events and images (e.g., gear healing tree), with subtext in implication; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the tree's song, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., wind-music as guide); voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping. Rhythmic consistency supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "canopy of copper leaves"), and propulsion remains clear through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mechanical rainforest and philosophical straying with non-obvious ingenuity; specific details (e.g., gear as talisman) feel inevitable, and risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
