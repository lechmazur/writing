<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Helena's claustrophobia and determination are vividly embodied through micro-choices like breathing through panic while crawling, with internal conflict driving credible agency. The final archive discovery earns its cost through prior causality, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from organ sequence to lock revelation, with orientation anchored by ~120 words. Closure lands as a decisive change opening archives, cost legible in "grief in the discovery" and grandmother's legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices concretely: claustrophobic passages constrain movement, organ reverberation triggers mechanism. "Shadowed nexus under starlight" and fallow period filter through POV to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens via Helena's agency—playing organ, crawling—narrowing options to the lock. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and grief, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "spatial mutiny" emerges organically from action and imagery, avoiding moralizing; ending reweights courage as "refusal to be contained" without stated thesis, resonating through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("walls that seemed to lean inward"), lyrical rhythm under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., compass point backstory anchored in present action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "transfix the very dust motes" serves momentum, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobic explorer and archival mystery transforms tropes through specific stakes; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
