<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to favor listening over noise is clear and consistent, driving her micro-choices like tracing the rope and recording data. Her final action of ringing the bell is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the atmospheric equilibrium shift. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the bell's sound spreading "like ripples in still water." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details to the solstice moment. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the rope's mending tightens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary constrains choice and charges the final image, with the bell rope acting as a micro-setting that shapes Mira's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, such as "the air tasted thin and the light arrived unfiltered."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, from tracking microclimates to pulling the rope, with cost legible in the atmosphere's response. The dominant stake (listening vs. noise) tightens through the solstice approach and the keeper's note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges through particulars like the bell's sound offering "presence instead of panic," without moralizing. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of paused recognition in the valleys below.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "the weight of accumulated silence." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and purposeful elision (e.g., the keepers' silent gathering) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "ripples in still water," is coherent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax without sluggishness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements (sanctuary above clouds, zero hour) into a non-obvious whole, transforming tropes through specific details like microclimate tracking. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
