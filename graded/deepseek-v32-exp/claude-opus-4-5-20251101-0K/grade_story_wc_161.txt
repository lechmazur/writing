<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a pigeon trainer, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like weeping over the meteorite. Her micro-choices, such as deciding to confess to Mira, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final choice to start a journal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara begins her journal, reconfiguring her identity with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of dust and the meteorite charging the ending. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like decay and dust motes filtering through Elara's POV. The skylight and meteorite constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment into theme and action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's internal conflict about trust, escalating through her agency in confessing to Mira. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with the meteorite and dust patterns, and cost is legible in the emotional weight of her revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of reinvention and carrying echoes emerge through particulars like the meteorite and pigeons, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the journal image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's lyrical, reflective voice. Dialogue with Mira is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot with subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story without momentum loss. Read-aloud test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of pigeon trainer, meteorite, and bookshop attic, transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
