Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like "the familiar ache of beauty too large for his chest." The final choice to deliver his findings and continue his work is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his exile and purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Marcus whispers Samuel's name, reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sound gatherings to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the "feral loft" and jars constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "salt and rotting kelp" are filtered through POV, and the environment pressures tactics, such as using sounds to decipher the tune.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the accumulative lens, as he gathers sounds and deciphers the music box, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through gathering discarded elements emerges naturally from events and images, with subtext in sounds and memories.

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and poetic diction.

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative lens effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of capturing sounds in jars is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.
