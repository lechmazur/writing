<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her history as a pit musician, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "numb fingers"). Her obsession drives higher-stakes choices, and the final action of securing Voss's vindication is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her endurance of the cold flood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: water damage reveals clues, leading Clara to decode and find evidence. Closure is a decisive change (retrieving documents and planning to disrupt history) with felt cost (physical discomfort and emotional resolution). Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (wading through water to access the panel) and charging the final image (flooded opera house as transformative medium). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Clara's professional bias (e.g., "lanterns cast trembling shadows").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through Clara's agency: decoding annotations, finding the panel, retrieving documents. Cost is legible in her physical struggle and the conceptual price of vindication. One meaningful tightening occurs as options narrow to the hidden compartment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility as power emerges naturally from events and images (e.g., Clara in "in between spaces"). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her realization, without moralizing. Subtext operates in wordless conversation with Voss's ghost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "music was born but never seen"). Voice is lyrical yet controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression (e.g., "ghost had left her breadcrumbs"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "lanterns danced their ancient waltz"). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost story and mystery with fresh, specific details (water damage as code). Risks with supernatural elements heighten stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth arises from Clara's grounded struggle, making the resolution inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
