<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in emotional loss, with embodied interiority and a credible shift from control to acceptance. Yua's changeless precision and wisdom are consistent, and the final choice to stay feels earned by prior causality. Minor hairline slip in the rapidity of emotional resolution, but cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost as Mira embraces release. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the leaf falling scene serving as a decisive intensification. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lunar observatory constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like the "silver, translucent" leaves being purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV. Micro-setting (the clock hand, leaf) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional release escalates under accumulative lens through Mira's agency in the leaf falling beat, narrowing options with visible cost in her tears and peace. Coherent pressure deepens without coincidence, and the final reconfiguration is driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and release emerges through particulars like the clock hand and leaf, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Mira's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic prose rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., father's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "a prayer frozen in stone" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative escalation, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (observatory, clock hand, escape velocity) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific grounded choices, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
