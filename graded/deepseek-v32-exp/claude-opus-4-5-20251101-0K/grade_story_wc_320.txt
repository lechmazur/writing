<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistently drives her choices; her internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices like discarding assumptions, and the final insight is earned with visible cost (weeping). The characterization avoids stock phrasing and shows credible endurance under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's weeping and the towers' transformation; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory density to the final image of changed frequency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., climbing the rusted ladder); the gorge and towers charge the final image with atmospheric weight, and sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as she overcomes static through discarded assumptions; cost is legible in her emotional response and the reconfiguration of stakes, with one meaningful tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., the shard of hush redefining endings); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in silence and transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative build, and elision (e.g., the silent transmission) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of celestial interpretation and abandoned technology; risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the Hollywood star fragment avoids derivativeness.</comment>
