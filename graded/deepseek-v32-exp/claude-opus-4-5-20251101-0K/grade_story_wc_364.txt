<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oren's meekness and quiet determination are consistently embodied through micro-choices like patient navigation of mines and deliberate forging, with his transformation earned by prior causality; the final stance as Arch-Smith forecloses his passive path with visible cost in years of effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with clear orientation early; closure is a decisive change (Oren's revival of the orchards) underpinned by felt cost in the laborious process, and the mine shafts as a persistent constraint shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating arches and bioluminescent mines constrain choices (e.g., mine descent enables discovery) and charge the final image of azure flames; sensory details are selective and filtered through Oren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes against the blight escalate through Oren's agency—finding silk, bartering knowledge, applying it—with cost legible in the time and effort described; one meaningful tightening occurs when the crystalline woman offers a path that demands everything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forged resilience emerges organically from events like the barter and grafting, without moralizing; the ending's image of azure flames reweights prior struggle with a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "meek doesn't mean weak"); voice modulates poetically under pressure, and dialogue with the crystalline woman carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; sentences like "resilience isn't found. It's forged" advance story and theme with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blacksmith, orchard planet, and bartered magic feels fresh and inevitable; specific details like core-heat forgery transform tropes through grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
