<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper's "sincerely insincere" professionalism and Sera's embodied desperation create credible micro-choices under pressure. Sera's renunciation is earned through wind chime interpretation, with cost legible in her shifted shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in Sera's lightened burden. Orientation clear by ~120 words; wind chimes method structures causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse and wind chimes constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (amber light, chimes) are selective and purposeful, filtered through keeper's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through keeper's agency in deciphering chimes and mirror; Sera's acceptance forecloses searching with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing nuance emerges through hollow mirror and chimes without moralizing. Ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity in "emptiness isn't always absence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; keeper's perceptual signature ("protected vulnerability") controls rhythm. Dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and elegant without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("horizon split itself") enhances clarity and momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conscience-for-hire trope with wind chime method; specific details (hollow mirror) heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
