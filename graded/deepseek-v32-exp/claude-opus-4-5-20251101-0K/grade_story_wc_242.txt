<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final guidance to the caller feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional shift. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in grief are handled with specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the woman's decision to look at baby pictures reweights grief. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with pattern of calls tightening meaning. Orientation is clear early; structure is a single scene with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the subway tunnel and glass disc charge the final image with sensory detail. Sensory selection reflects urgency, integrated into action. The disc's recurrence reweights meaning, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional healing escalates through Vera's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the caller's shift. One meaningful tightening occurs as Vera redirects the grief loop, foreclosing stagnant repetition. Pressure coheres without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and renewal emerges through particulars—the glass disc and calls—without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of loops spiraling outward. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and non-obvious—undergone phone operator for wrong numbers—synthesized with specific detail.
