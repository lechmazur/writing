<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to continue her mother's work is earned by the revelation, with visible cost in the weight of truth. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and the cyclical spontaneity of her gift adds credible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Mira understands her mother's sacrifice and commits to documenting safe passages, with felt cost in the price of the inherited gift. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from discovery to action. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of dimensional toxicity shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, filtered through Mira's POV. The abandoned spaceport repair bay constrains choices by hosting rifts and charging the final image with its cathedral-like obsolescence. Objects like the green glass shard and magnetic coupling unit are integrated into action and reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as she uses her abilities to witness the past confrontation, narrowing options and revealing the cost of dimensional toxicity. The dominant stake of discovering the truth tightens meaningfully, with a visible price in the understanding of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and inheritance emerges through particulars like the green glass shard and the mother's mapping, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's decision, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, rich in sensory bias and rhythmic control. Dialogue in the flashback is natural and goal-driven. Elision in the cyclical surge is taught and pays off, with no head-hopping. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "reality felt thin as membrane," without muddle. Minor overwriting in peaks is negligible, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, dimensional weaving, and familial legacy feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the cyclical spontaneity that heightens stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the green glass shard as a filter, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
