<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance and change. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the retrieval of the embryo reconfigures tradition and progress. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with coherent causality from plant communication to decoding and unsealing. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in Mira's effort and the promise of growth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (steam, heat) filtered through Mira's POV. The volcanic hot springs constrain choice and charge the final image, as the environment is essential to unsealing the embryo. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving tradition vs. reconstruction) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase—decoding the script and singing to unseal. Agency drives escalation, with cost legible in Mira's effort. One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights stakes, though pressure could be slightly tighter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges implicitly from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in plant whispers and the embryo's retrieval. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed's planting, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Mira's voice is poetic yet grounded, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., kite discovery) is taught and paid off. Minor point: no dialogue to evaluate, but narrative stance is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy with plants, embryo in amber, and decoding feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in blending magical realism with ecological themes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
