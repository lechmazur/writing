<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with concrete interiority and internal conflict, such as the dual allegiance pressing on her chest. Her micro-choices, like adding the graffiti symbol, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final endurance as Charged Poise is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exhaustion and fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's exhausted smile and decision to continue. The Hybrid lens (leaning Causal) holds, with because/therefore linkages from graffiti to resistance meeting. Orientation is clear early, and the stone chip as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The raft city setting vividly pressures choices through its fragility and carnival atmosphere, with sensory details like accordion music and dark water. The foundation stone chip as a micro-setting object constrains Mira's choices and charges the final image, enhancing stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) escalates through Mira's agency in translating conflicts and organizing resistance. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and fear, and escalation under the Hybrid lens tightens options, such as the six-month deadline forcing reorganization plans.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unity in resistance emerges organically through symbols like the graffiti and stone chip, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with a resonant image of "weaving them together," offering a non-literal answer to gentrification pressures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in phrases like "fractured rainbows." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., Tomás's terse exchange. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., graffiti symbols) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor density in figurative language (e.g., "lights reflecting off the dark water in fractured rainbows") is purposeful and does not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes (raft city, culture shock absorber) feels inevitable through specific world-building and character depth. Risk-taking in symbolic elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed with emotional truth.</comment>
