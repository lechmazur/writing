<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her "logically emotional" trait, which constrains her choices and earns her final sacrifice. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the plot. The cost of her dissolution is palpable and scaled to the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Vera releases the Source Tone, resulting in her dissolution with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly, with time pressure and the Consortium's approach narrowing options. Orientation is clear early, and the final image of the key and coat recharges prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, like the groaning pontoons and ice-chapel, which pressure Vera's choices and charge the final image. The environment constrains tactics through the ice maze and time constraint, integrated seamlessly with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Vera's agency, from deciding to release the tone to achieving vibrational matching, with cost legible in her dissolution. The dominant stake of protecting the Source Tone tightens under time pressure, and the resolution is earned by her sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and absolution emerges organically from events and imagery, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dispersed sound and Vera's peace, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, reflecting Vera's mindset under stress. Rhythmic control is evident in prose modulation, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm, though minor purple phrasing like "fleshly ethereal" repeats slightly. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and propulsion remains strong through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes sonic absolution and sacrifice with fresh, specific details. Risk-taking in the resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
