<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to capture the fading dream is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion shown in her weeping and laughter. Her micro-choices, like climbing the roof in fog, reveal stubborn hope, and the final earned reconfiguration of absence is rooted in prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is dramatized through failed attempts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a conceptual repricing where the photograph reweights absence with cost legible in Miriam's weeping. Causality is tight from dream loss to palette discovery to breakthrough. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of fading memory shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the archipelago's wind and fog filtering perception. The palette acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice during rooftop experiments, charging the final image. Sensory details like "blade of gold cutting the mist" are selective and reflect urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the dream escalates through Miriam's agency, from failed attempts to the fog-shrouded breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight of loss and the transformed absence. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges organically through the cipher of longing and the final image of cupped hands, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like weeping and silence, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, perceptual signature in noticing light and absence. Dialogue is minimal but natural in rumors. Elision is taught and paid off, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere.
