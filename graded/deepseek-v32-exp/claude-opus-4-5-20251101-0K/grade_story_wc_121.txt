<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under accumulative lens; orientation clear early, causality intact, and persistent constraint (tablet/timelines) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid setting with sensory details that constrain choices (e.g., viaduct and tablet charge the final image); micro-setting integral to narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens; cost legible in acceptance of endless construction, foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice consistent and purposeful, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (e.g., fractured timelines, procedural generation) feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes.</comment>
