<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's grief and shifting certainty are embodied through specific sensory details like "panic tasted like copper and salt," and her final acceptance of nuance is earned by the cascading revelations. Veris's incisive kindness constrains her telepathic dialogue, avoiding stock phrasing. The micro-choice of taking the ampoule reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost as Mira's certainty dissolves into possibility, reinforced by the ampoule's weight against her heart. Causal lens holds tight from search to revelation, with orientation anchored early by the drowned garden and diver. The final image of bubbles rising charges the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choice through its phosphorescent algae and coral-choked pathways, directly shaping Mira's approach and the ampoule's revelation. Sensory details like "stone grinding against stone" are filtered through Mira's urgency, and the setting charges the final image of ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: her decision to swim closer triggers revelations that narrow her options from vindication to acceptance. Cost is legible in the dissolution of her "certainty like a lifeline" and the vertigo of the invitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the ampoule and structural weakness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to consciousness and death without moralizing. Subtext operates in Veris's gentle corrections and the final image of light dividing and rejoining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "grief wrapped around a desperate hope." Telepathic dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, and rhythmic control under pressure avoids head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "certainty like a lifeline" is purposeful and clear, and sentences advance character and atmosphere cohesively, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of living statue telepathy with cosmic consciousness feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific details like the chisel slip. Risk-taking in lyric prose and quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
