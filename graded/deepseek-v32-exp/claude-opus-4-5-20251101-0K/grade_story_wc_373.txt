<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her steadfast trait is demonstrated through action, and the final choice to destroy the sound is earned by prior causality. The watch fob serves as a concrete anchor for her interiority, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, leading to a decisive change where Eliza intercepts the cylinder. Closure lands on-page with cost felt in her peace and the maintained truce. Orientation is clear early, and the watch fob as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "lanterns swinging like captured stars" and the murky eel tank, which constrains choices by influencing movement and reflection. The pirate market pressures actions and charges the final image of dawn, integrating environment with character goals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of the truce is signaled early and escalates through Eliza's failed attempts, culminating in a tightening choice to intercept the cylinder. Agency drives escalation under the causal lens, with cost legible in her hammering heart and the peace earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence and legacy emerges through particulars like the watch fob and the sound recording, without direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Eliza's biased observations. Voice modulates with pressure, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "captured stars" is purposeful, and propulsion is maintained through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of concepts like the sound recording and pirate market, transforming tropes through specific details.
