<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to discover meaning is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance and decision to act are earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtly shown rather than deeply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Maya's peace and renewed purpose, under an Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the spaceport and stone circle constraining choice and charging the final image. Details are purposefully filtered through Maya's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (finding meaning) escalate under the Accumulative lens through the stone circle's hum, driven by Maya's agency in attention and realization. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and decision to act, though escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning in rebellion through the final reconfiguration. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing, and wisdom is earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the stone circle crescendo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the perspective is memorable.</comment>
