<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting her expression when Maya comments on her gaze. The final choice to give the locket is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Maya's crying and smiling, under the accumulative/textural lens. The locket and roots shape tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the eclipse and conversation cohere toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like sage perfume and dreaming roots charging the final image. The environment mirrors internal states and supports theme, though it doesn't heavily constrain choices. Micro-setting (locket) reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection and fear of change) escalates through the eclipse and dialogue, driven by Elena's agency in giving the locket. Cost is unmistakable in Maya's emotional response, tightening options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in the locket and eclipse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Maya's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the recurrence of "dreaming roots."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks, but doesn't obscure clarity. Sentence rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of elements (eclipse, music therapist, locket) that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet ending. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
