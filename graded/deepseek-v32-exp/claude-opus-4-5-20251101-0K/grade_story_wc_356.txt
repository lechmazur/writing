<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with interiority shown through sensory perception and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to leave is earned by prior causality, showcasing contradictory impulses and a visible cost in renouncing the village's serenity. The olfactory trait consistently shapes her actions and revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira embraces serenity in motion, with cost legible in her departure. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by sensory and thematic density. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, particularly smell, which constrains choices and charges the final image. Setting acts as a crucible, mirroring internal states and influencing Mira's journey without exposition. Spatial choreography remains clear and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quest for wisdom) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency, culminating in a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Pressure tightens via her interaction with the flower, though the escalation is more deepening than dramatic reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the corpse flower's decay, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of wisdom in rejection. Subtext operates through implication and concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in olfaction. Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision and compression are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and variety, advancing story without scaffolding or loops. Information density is high, and figurative language serves the narrative without muddle. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of corpse flower lore and treetop village feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
