<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies through his interaction with the rope and the woman. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in tracing the rope's history. Micro-choices, like handing the rope to the woman, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to listen and add layers is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the accumulated presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where time's accumulation is reweighted through the final image of the grotto filling with presence. Orientation is anchored early by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the line "each one leaving traces for those who learned to read them," with the rope's history shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting, constraining choice by providing a reflective space that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "soft luminescence" and "warm clay." However, it does not fully constrain a pivotal choice, capping at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering time's texture escalates through the woman's arrival and the rope's revelation, deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is in Marcus's decision to share the rope and listen, foreclosing isolation with cost in the exchange. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman senses Jerome's terror and wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of choices and time emerges through particulars like the rope and grotto, with subtext in objects and dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "choice by impossible choice," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned through specific struggle and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's poetic voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., the woman's challenge about "ethically playful." Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping. Elision in time shifts is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "Time, Marcus discovered, had texture." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. Minor register drift in "ethically playful" slightly clashes with POV, but clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes energy beings and object-reading with fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: emotional arc is specific to this voice and setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
