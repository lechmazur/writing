<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her grief and love for Elias, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, as she transforms regret into actionable insight without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens, as Mira's crystallization of fears reweights her role with felt cost. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting and atlas page constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The cracked dome and scattered light are integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as she actively uses the atlas and light to transform fears. Cost is legible in the crystallization and her decision to return to duties with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in the crystallization and finished phrases. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic yet controlled perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports emotional pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "crystallized grief") does not harm clarity in peak beats, and propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of grief and fantasy, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
