<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied emotion like "her heart clench" at the arrow tip discovery. Micro-choices under pressure, such as surrendering to the water flow, reveal character, and the final planting of the seed is earned by prior causality. However, interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via Maren's realization that resilience is cultivated, not harvested, with cost legible in "She could not take the source home." The causal-hybrid lens holds, driven by discoveries like the arrow tip triggering whispers, and constraints like water flow shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet setting is vivid with sensory details like "amber light" and "whirling silence," and it actively constrains choices through water flow navigation and gravity inversion. The environment charges the final image as the grove hums with welcome after Maren plants the seed, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with the countdown to inversion, and escalation is driven by Maren's agency, such as following the current to the hidden grove. Cost is unmistakable when she accepts she cannot take the source but plants a seed, foreclosing an option under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the gathering of echoes and the broken arrow tip, with subtext in whispers like "Resilience isn't found. It's grown from what breaks." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed planting, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic texture that modulates under pressure, such as in the "whirling silence" before inversion. The whispers function as dialogue-like action, carrying subtext, though the single POV limits character voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no figurative muddle, as in the climax where "golden light pulsed from the ancient trees." Information density is high, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes unique elements like inverted gravity and collective hope into an inevitable whole, with risk-taking in the lyric closure. Specificity in details like the broken arrow tip with a family crest transforms familiar tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
