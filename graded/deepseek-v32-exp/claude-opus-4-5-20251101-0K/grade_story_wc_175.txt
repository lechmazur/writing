<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her hesitation when using the moth wing. Internal conflict is shown in scene, and her final renunciation (dismantling structures) is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera witnesses the migration and dismantles her structures, with felt cost in her tears and the acknowledgment of extinction. Under the accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly described with selective sensory detail and constrains choices, such as Vera building structures on its perimeter. It charges the final image of "temporary cathedrals" and mirrors internal states. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring the butterflies' migration) escalates under the accumulative lens through Vera's agency in building structures and the butterflies' response. Cost is legible when she weeps and dismantles everything, foreclosing options with visible price. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and extinction emerges through particulars like the moth wing and knots, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "temporary cathedrals." Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping. Prose reflects Vera's mindset, and elision (e.g., the grandmother's backstory) is taught and pays off in closure. Diction remains within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, as in "living river of fire." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. No register drift or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is original and synthesized through specific details like knot language and temporary structures, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
