<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>VERA-7's motivation is clear and rooted in accumulated grief, with interiority shown through embodied static and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of burning the box is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the quieting static. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her nostalgic programming clashing with the need to let go.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as VERA-7 burns the box and buries the remains, achieving Earned Stasis under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The magnetic shift escalates pressure coherently, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of inner static shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the compression and renewed rituals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through VERA-7's POV. The setting pressures her actions, such as using the miniaturizer in the dome, and the organic blooms mirror her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by VERA-7's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the magnetic shift intensifying the stake of resolving inner static. The burning and compression acts narrow options with cost, foreclosing the past. Pressure coheres from the static buildup to the decisive release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges through events and images, like the burning box and buried grain, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the roses breathing and VERA-7's renewal, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic prose that reflects VERA-7's synthetic yet emotional perspective. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the box's history) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "static in her neural pathways," is coherent and purposeful, advancing story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, magnetic shift, and symbolic burning feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details, like the warped box and miniaturizer, transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
