<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Serin's motivation is clear and rooted in her potter's patience, with concrete interiority like feeling clay's fractures. Her final decision to stay is earned by the discovery of the disc's function, demonstrating a credible endurance with implied cost. However, the cost of her renunciation is subtle, not fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Serin's realization that stability is refined movement reweights the premise, with cost legible in "Not forever—she was not made for permanence." The hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds, and the brass disc as a persistent constraint shapes the ending. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—abandoned apiaries, brass disc—and constrains choice by guiding Serin's discovery through sun patterns. Sensory details like "air tasted different... like memory preserved in amber" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The disc charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) escalates through Serin's agency in following light paths and uncovering the disc's mechanism. Cost is felt in her decision to stay, narrowing options under the hybrid lens. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kindness selecting timelines emerges organically from the disc's revelation, with subtext in images like "bee remembering the way home." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final vessel-making act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("gray ribbons pressed to glass") that reflects Serin's potter mindset. Voice modulates with emotional beats, and purposeful compression (e.g., fractured timelines) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "light bending toward the disc"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure is sharpened by concise, image-driven lines. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of phototropic kindness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of timelines and morality, transformed through specific details like the lantern glass. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision prevails.</comment>
