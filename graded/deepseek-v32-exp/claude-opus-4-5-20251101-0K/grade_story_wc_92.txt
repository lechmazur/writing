<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's vigilance and patience are concretely embodied through her decoding and strategic recruitment; her final choice to trigger the revolution is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt as she returns to her post, maintaining a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as messengers depart, irreversibly cracking the Duke's foundation under a causal lens; the cost is legible in Maren's silent return, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Luminous Fort's glass panels and blackout pressure choices by enabling intrigue; the quill holder and sundial act as micro-settings that constrain decoding and charge the final image of sparks waiting to ignite.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from decoding to executing the blackout plan; the stakes tighten as evidence is sent, with cost visible in the foreclosed path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sparks metaphor and imagery of light vs. friction, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about revolution without moralizing; subtext operates in the quiet rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on angles and patience; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision in decoding is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "sparks from friction" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of silent revolution through coded messages and a lock sentinel's patience; risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
