<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift, driving high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like weeping and gasping under pressure. Her final choice to harvest and memorize the fruits is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—Maren carries seeds and knowledge, foreclosing safety for revolution. Causal lens holds tightly from planting to harvest. Orientation is anchored early with the greenhouse and moons alignment, and the cost is legible in her pocket-heavy walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "scent of decay" and "liquid knowledge" moonlight. Setting is integrated into action, shaping Maren's pruning and planting, and mirrors internal states of decay and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rebellion is signaled early and escalates through Maren's agency—planting the seed and harvesting under time pressure. Cost is legible in the risk of regime detection, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off between safety and revolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rebellion emerges through particulars like the seed's weight and the fruits' contents, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maren's commitment to "forbidden meals," reweighting prior ruins with hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Maren, with a distinct perceptual signature in her sensory-based wisdom. Voice is consistent and lyrical, e.g., "forgotten ribcage" and "liquid knowledge," and any elision in memory flashes is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "synaptic plasticity" introduction) slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-tasting chef and knowledge fruit feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the celestial alignment and gentle rebellion. Specific details like "tongue could taste what others had forgotten" transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
