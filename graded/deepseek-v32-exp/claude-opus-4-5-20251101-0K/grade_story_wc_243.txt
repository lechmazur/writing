<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation is clear and rooted in her history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to renew the covenant is earned by decades of work and the discovery of the letters, with visible cost in giving up the locket. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost when Marguerite gives the locket and commits to her role, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the covenant's constraint shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the loss of the locket and gain of purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the blooming jetty and twilight atmosphere constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, integrating into action and theme without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving small moments escalates through agency-driven discovery and the Keeper's appearance, narrowing options with cost. Marguerite's choice to give the locket forecloses a path and reweights the covenant, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of small moments carrying weight emerges through events and images like the locket and letters, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Marguerite's commitment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is poetic yet clear, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and supports pressure, with clear propulsion in key beats like the covenant renewal. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of covenant renewal through small moments, transformed via specific details and character depth.
