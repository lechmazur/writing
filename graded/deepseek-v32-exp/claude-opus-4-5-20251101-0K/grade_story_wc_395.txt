<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Helena's motivation is clear and rooted in her obsession with deleted files, intensifying under pressure. Her micro-choices, like lying to access servers, reveal values with cost. Interiority is concrete, though some emotional beats rely on summary rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with coherent linkages; closure is a decisive change as Helena runs into the night, risking safety. Cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and structure fits the scope with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the missile silo archive constrains choices with sensory details like humming servers and forgotten songs. The environment charges the final image, influencing tactics and atmosphere without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Helena's agency, from investigating numbers to copying data and fleeing. One meaningful tightening narrows options, with cost visible in her flight. Dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs. testimony emerges through particulars like numbers and the patch, with subtext in implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some motifs are slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., corrupted data) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("mechanical ghosts") is purposeful, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements (corporate conspiracy) with fresh specifics like memory keeper role and Artemis-7 connection. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
