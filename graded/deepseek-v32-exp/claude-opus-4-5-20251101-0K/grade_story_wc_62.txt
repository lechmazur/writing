<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like sketching relationships revealing her values. Her growth from individual to collective grief thinking is earned through causality, and the final understanding of grief as love made visible by absence carries cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her meditation balancing quiet thought with active carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to a Conceptual Repricing closure where grief is reconfigured as love. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in Elara's ongoing work and the migration timeframe. Persistent constraints like the ribbon and greenhouse shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "glass that caught the dying light like tears" integrating action and theme. The greenhouse charges the final image by mirroring decay and cultivation, and tools like the ribbon constrain choices. Specificity reflects POV bias without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding collective grief escalate through Elara's agency, such as retracing the pattern and sketching relationships, under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her emotional effort and the foreclosed path of individual mourning. One meaningful tightening occurs as she moves from confusion to insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon roll and poems, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("love made visible by absence") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in lines like "their wings carrying the last warmth of October." Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, and elision is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under pressure heightens clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "grief as architecture," without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the Accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes spectral mentorship and gravestone carving with specific details like the ribbon roll and poems, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of grief tropes through lived detail avoids derivative premises.</comment>
