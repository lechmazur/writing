<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Margot's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses (methodical precision vs. playful experimentation) driving micro-choices under pressure. Her final shift from restorer to participant is earned through causal progression, with the hobo nickel anchoring personal mythology. The cost of exchanging certainty for curiosity is legible in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through sensory patterns to a Conceptual Repricing closure where wonder activates the mural. Orientation is immediate, and the pause between question and reply serves as a pivotal tightening. Cost is felt in Margot's transformed stance, with the nested awakenings image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific, constraining choices (e.g., parabolic reflectors) and charging the final image with tactile detail. Sensory selection reflects Margot's professional bias, and the environment pressures tactics throughout. The garden's mechanics are integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. restoring) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Margot's agency, culminating in her question that forecloses certainty. Cost is legible in her embrace of wonder, with the central panel's revelation narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the nested awakenings and hobo nickel, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to curiosity vs. certainty. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration charges prior particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters detail through Margot's expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., the pause) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "bloomed in frequencies rather than petals." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene urgency, and peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes sound art, personal mythology, and nested reality with non-obvious ingenuity. Risks in structure and concept heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors universals, and transformation is full-throated.</comment>
