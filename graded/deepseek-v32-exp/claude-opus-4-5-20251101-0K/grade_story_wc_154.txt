<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., softening the translation about boats) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final realization about healing as translation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the chest loosening. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: Marina's plan to discard the coral reweights the premise of memory and healing. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern intensification through the cast decryption. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the child's cast function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., condensation turning light amber), filtered through Marina's POV. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, as decrypting the cast deepens her internal conflict about memory and translation. Cost is legible in her chest tightening and the softened translation. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coral fragment and cast messages, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., tracing words) and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled ("lotus-hearted ache"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "anesthetic spread like warm honey"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of translation and healing tropes through grounded details (Tausug phrases, brain coral). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
