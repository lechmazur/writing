<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "spongey dread"). Her micro-choices under pressure, such as decoding the journals and confronting Torres, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final shift to hope is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dread that remains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a decisive change (Mira's newfound confidence and Torres's action) with felt cost (dread sharing space with hope). The causal lens holds strong, driven by Mira's decoding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the copper nail constrains tactics, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (e.g., "winds that no longer followed the old patterns") and pressures choices, as the station is essential for understanding the chaos. The copper nail and journals recur, constraining Mira's actions and charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warning coastal populations) escalates through Mira's agency in decoding and convincing Torres, under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the "spongey dread" and urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the correlation between journals and data is revealed, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and warning emerges through particulars like the journals and nail, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with hope amid dread, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in coded stanzas and Mira's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "spongey dread"). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., journal decoding mechanics) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Mira's exchange with Torres.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative, with high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "The wind howled against the station's walls"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate fiction and legacy themes, with a non-obvious angle via coded journals and reversible exile. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
