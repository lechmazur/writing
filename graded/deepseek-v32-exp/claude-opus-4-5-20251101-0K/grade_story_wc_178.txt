<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her frugality and desire for transcendence through mathematics. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The final endurance—waiting despite dismissal—is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the acknowledgment that others will dismiss her findings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the invitation reweights the premise of communication with the unknown, with cost felt in Mira's acceptance of future dismissal. Causal lens holds strong through her methodical work leading to discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens is consistent, with no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the palace and magic square tile constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, such as the "amber light" and "lapis lazuli." The environment pressures tactics and integrates into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communicating with the unknown escalates through Mira's agency in calculations and observations, leading to the discovery. Cost is legible in her decision to wait despite anticipated dismissal, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in Mira's actions as a skeptic praying through mathematics. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the conceptual cost of her covenant. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's scholarly, precise voice. Prose rhythm and diction reflect her mindset under pressure, and any elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift, and internal thought is consistent and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "bridge built from numbers and devotion." Minor overwriting in places like "dusky harmony" but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomy, mathematics, and ancient setting feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the magic square tile. Risk-taking in blending rationalism and transcendence heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
