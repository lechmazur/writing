<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("cheerful gloom"); her motivation intensifies under time pressure, and the final choice to plant seeds is earned with visible cost in her tears and laughter. Micro-choices like gathering seeds reveal her values, and emotional progression is realistic with layered grief and wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in Mira's realization and seed-planting; the accumulative lens holds, building through emotion and image. Orientation is clear early, and the path transformation theme is resolved without exposition, foreclosing the search with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The iridescent cave constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "crystal formations that hummed with trapped light"). The setting mirrors internal states and evolves with the action, such as seeds placed in crevices, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens; her conjecture with seeds narrows options and leads to a cost-legible insight. The dominant stake of understanding paths transforms with a visible price in her emotional release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like seeds and light, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to path disappearance; subtext operates in implication (e.g., seeds as transformed paths). The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "cheerful gloom like a second skin"). Elision is taught and paid off in closure, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "grief could be transliterated"). Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of recollectionist magic, emotional transliteration, and path metaphysics; specifics feel inevitable and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes. The concept is transformed through grounded choices in character and theme.</comment>
