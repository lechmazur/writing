<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory, showing her habit and deeper draw; her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., offering the lens) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Theo's backstory of mistrust adds depth, and their exchange earns the final reconfiguration through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (thawing mistrust) with felt cost in the exchange of lens and drawing; the accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the crystal acoustics whispering the moment. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the wordless world shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices through acoustics and light; it charges the final image by amplifying their exchange. Details are filtered through Mira's POV, integrating setting with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming mistrust escalates through Mira's agency (eavesdropping, approaching, exchanging) under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in her giving up the lens and Theo's tension thawing. One meaningful tightening deepens the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth beyond words emerges through particulars like the lens and doodles, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Mira's use of lens, attention to echoes); prose has controlled rhythm and purposeful compression. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of a wordless world is fresh, synthesized with specific choices like doodles on tickets; the non-verbal resolution feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation through lived detail avoids template plots.</comment>
