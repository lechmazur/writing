<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like uncertainty transforming into warmth. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her fear walking alongside determination, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she laughs and the spirits harmonize. Micro-choices under pressure, like touching the harp, reveal her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Maren reconfigures her purpose through the harp's revelations, with felt cost in her luminous tears and shifted ache. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through spectral confessions that deepen meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the crocodile's tooth shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge and the harp function as micro-setting that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "ghostly repetitions" and "striated stone" woven into action. The environment pressures Maren's journey, and the crocodile's tooth recurs with reweighted meaning, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as she actively engages the harp, leading to confessions that deepen stakes and reveal cost. The dominant stake of self-understanding tightens through her choices, with visible price in her emotional transformation and the spirits' gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as the spirits' confessions illustrating joy as sorrow's companion, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maren's laughter and the glowing ache, reweighting prior material like Vasilis's lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Maren's biased observations, like "uncertainty" filtering the gorge. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in phrases like "beautifully wrong," and any elision (e.g., harp's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "opaque as river fog," is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the climax with spirits.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a soul collector and spectral confessions offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
