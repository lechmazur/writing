<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in her inheritance, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. However, the lack of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure prevents a higher score, though her renunciation is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in her daily endurance, under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and integral, with the labyrinth and lamp constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mei's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her repeated climbs and recordings. The dominant stake of collecting textures tightens meaningfully, though it lacks a dramatic turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of invented histories emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose reflects Mei's mind consistently, and any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Sentence-level craft supports rhythm and clarity, with figurative language that enhances rather than obscures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious whole, with risk-taking in the quiet plot that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
