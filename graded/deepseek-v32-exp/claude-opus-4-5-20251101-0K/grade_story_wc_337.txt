<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her past as a restorer, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her trembling hands finding purpose in unraveling. Her internal conflict between guilt and redemption is shown through contradictory impulses, and her final realization—that she can now restore masks honestly—is earned by the causality of the unraveling process. The spirit Callum adds secondary pressure, and Mira's change is scaled with visible cost, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered silences and secrets, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira's peace is earned. Causality is tight, from unraveling knots to her hands steadying, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The cost is legible in the final image of her carrying "interlaced hush" as peace, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "fracturing the heavens" and "whispers" woven into action. The environment pressures Mira's unraveling and mirrors her internal state, and the net's transformation from rope to empty symbol is integral to the closure. Specificity is high without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mira's agency in unraveling knots, releasing secrets that deepen the stakes of guilt and redemption. The dominant stake—her internal conflict and grounding spirits—tightens through each confession, with cost visible in her transformed hands and newfound purpose. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like unraveling knots and fractured masks, exploring silence, guilt, and exchange without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's decision to stitch gold into breaks, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the net's whispers, avoiding thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose like "fracturing the heavens into a thousand quiet wounds." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the accident) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Mira's lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "accumulated silence instead, gathering it like dust." No register drift or artifact issues; syntax varies naturally to support pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of unraveling knots to exchange silences is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like the tapestry needle and prism sanctuary anchors universals. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices demonstrates authenticity of vision.</comment>
