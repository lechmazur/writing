<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in tracing the chalk message. Her trust in the ghost and actions driven by community care feel earned. Minor weakness: secondary characters like Marcus are briefly sketched, but this doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration in the ghost's response, redefining isolation and connection under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "I am not alone. I have you. That is enough."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with floating rock arches and silver-barked trees, constraining choices like harvesting starfruit. The butterfly garden bell charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of maintaining peace escalate through the ghost's messages prompting collective action, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is felt in the ghost's loneliness, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "brambled hope" emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the ghost's message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "Brambled hope." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Marcus's grunt. No head-hopping, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear with high information density, e.g., "fog drifted like breath." Rhythm varies naturally, and no artifacts obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a guiding ghost on an orchard planet, transforming tropes through specific details like chalk messages. Emotional truth in community building feels inevitable, and risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
