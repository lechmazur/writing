<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., chest ache from the fresco fragment) and an earned change through her genuine laugh and understanding of joy as practice. Internal conflict between commercial and personal art drives micro-choices, and the final renunciation of hollow work is scaled with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira commits to continuing her art, with cost legible in her laugh and the lighter fragment. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the fog as a persistent constraint, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (light painting due to fog) and charging the final image of the glowing mural. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the ruined orchard and fog weaving through action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her light-painting and integration of the fragment deepen the stakes of rediscovering joy. Cost is unmistakable in her hollow spirit and the genuine laugh, foreclosing the path of commercial art.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art as communion and joy as practice emerges organically from particulars like the fresco fragment and mural work, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image. No moralizing; subtext operates through warmth and integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, artist-filtered descriptions. Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (daydream state) is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "like exposed film," and propulsion is maintained through concrete action and image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ancient and modern art techniques feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the light-painting concept and emotional specificity. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
