<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her profession and past, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Her motivation to discover intentions is clear and drives the plot, with her gardening skills enabling the decoding. The final choice to return to the cemetery is earned by prior causality, and her blithe acceptance contrasts effectively with being unsettled, showing contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building pattern through decoding to a resonant reconfiguration closure. Causality is clear: Mira's skills lead to revelation of coordinates. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the weight of inheritance and connection. The drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "velveteen gloom" and "cobalt silo" filtered through Mira's POV. The silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Atmosphere supports theme cohesively, and spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering intentions escalates through Mira's agency in untangling threads, under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in time and emotional weight, narrowing options. However, conflict is internal and quiet, lacking intense external pressure, which slightly limits escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection through threads emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. Subtext in the tapestry and stars offers a resonant, non-literal answer to intentions. Earned wisdom arises from specifics, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice reflective of Mira's perception. Prose shows rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision in decoding is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register issues; internal voice is coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm supports accumulation. Line-level craft is flawless, with clear propulsion and selective detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of gardener, tapestry decoding, and familial secrets, transforming tropes through specific details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in reflective tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration feels inevitable and original.</comment>
