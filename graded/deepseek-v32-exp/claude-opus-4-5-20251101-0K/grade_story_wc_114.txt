<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassandra's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses (swallowing the truth vs. reporting it) acting in scene. Her final choice to withhold the vision is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitary burden. Micro-choices, like tracing the smudged illustration, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Cassandra's decision to "give them nothing" forecloses a path, carrying the weight of her silence. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by her vision and recovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of her fault-tolerant nature shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station pressures choices through isolation and instruments, while the botanical illustration constrains realization and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as frost "blooming" like illustrations, avoiding generic description. The setting evolves causally with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cassandra's agency under the causal lens, from her fevered vision to the decisive choice to withhold the truth. The dominant stake (truth vs. complicity) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her acceptance of private burden. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the smudged illustration and "occupying margins" reconfigure truth and silence without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Cassandra's stance, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Cassandra's oracle mindset. Dialogue with Mira is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "hollow as a struck bell") enhances voice without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "auroral sorrow" heightens pressure without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image lands with crisp clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fault-tolerant oracles and weather systems with inevitability, transforming tropes through specific character and setting. Risk-taking in structure (lyrical reflection) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth feels authentic and freshly inflected, resisting derivative patterns.</comment>
