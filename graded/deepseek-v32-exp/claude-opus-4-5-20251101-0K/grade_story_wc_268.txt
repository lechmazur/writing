<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as guardian. Her actions under pressure, such as using the ink and descending through the library, reveal her values and competence. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits depth, though her final choice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Mira placing evidence, a Decisive Change under the Causal lens, reconfiguring options with felt cost as time resumes. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through investigation and action. The persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library setting is integral, constraining choices and supplying resources like the genealogical record. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV. The environment charges the final image and alters tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmasking the pretender escalates through Mira's agency, from discovering messages to compiling evidence. Under the Causal lens, tightening occurs with a meaningful turn, and cost is legible in her effort and the time shift. No major reversals, but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth over violence emerges organically from events, with subtext in messages and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "graceful collapse" via paperwork, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats. No artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of titan as librarian subverts tropes, with specific details like the time-paused library. The concept feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Integration is seamless.</comment>
