<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like feeling "the pulse of unheard symphonies." Her final choice to speak the mountain's language is earned by prior causality, showing a credible shift from obstacle to guardian with visible cost in the hopeful resolution. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change under a Hybrid lens, as Mira and Thessaly's exit reconfigures the mountain's hope, costing its isolation. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through Mira's realized understanding driving the resolution. The persistent constraint of the mountain's fear shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices and charges the final image with the shelves settling hopefully. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action, such as the "nautilus shell" shelves and the botanical diary's map. POV bias filters setting through Mira's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Hybrid lens, from the time traveler's warning to her realization and negotiation, tightening options with cost legible in the mountain's shudder and Thessaly's emergence. Dominant stake of rescue deepens through protagonist-led turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events—learning versus ignorance—with subtext in the mountain's shame and the final image of sunlight as a "question." No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through particulars like the diary and unheard symphonies, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., the time traveler's ozone-scented arrival. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "sunlight waited like a question," without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sentient mountain, unlearned lessons, and rescue mission feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the time traveler's role heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the core premise is transformed through grounded character choices.</comment>
