<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between isolation and connection is embodied through precise micro-choices, such as lifting the doorknocker; Sera's mirrored scars deepen motivation, and the final decision to teach is earned with visible cost in the disturbed sanctuary.</comment>
