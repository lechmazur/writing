<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as the last seed saver is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown through actions like pressing her palm against the ice. The final choice to claim the inheritance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in risking dissolution. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the atrium's transformation and Maren's understanding. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. The vortex inheritance and method of decreasing entropy drive causality without breaks. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of preservation and hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly specific and sensory, constraining choices (e.g., the crystalline wall and frozen garden) and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the oak acorn cap are integrated into action. Setting pressures tactics and supports theme through selective, POV-filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding borrowed time escalates through Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, using the acorn cap and humming to decrease entropy. Cost is legible in the risk of dissolution and the transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs as she accesses the vortex, foreclosing other paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed time and patience emerges organically through events and images like the vortex and seeds, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed atrium and Maren's readiness, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; internal thought is coherent and character-specific, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "cathedral of ice." Sentences advance story and atmosphere without redundancy. Minor overwriting in peak beats is minimal and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seed saving, vortex inheritance, and icebound world feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes are transformed through specific choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible with emotional specificity.</comment>
