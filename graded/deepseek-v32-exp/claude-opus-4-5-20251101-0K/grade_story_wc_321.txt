<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's resilient positivity is consistently embodied and drives key choices, such as upending the hourglass despite the pain of splitting. Her motivation to merge timelines is rooted in prior discoveries, and the final endurance forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, with emotions shown through action (e.g., laughing through extraordinary pain).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara solidifies the ferry and commits to future work, with cost legible in her splitting pain. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, and orientation is clear early. The hourglass as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and ferry setting are vivid and sensory, constraining choices by enabling the timeline merge. The hourglass as a micro-setting object charges the final image with starlight. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing passengers) escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the hourglass act that narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in her physical splitting and the passengers' disorientation. One meaningful tightening forecloses alternatives with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as a net emerges through events and images like the hourglass and patterns, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mara's continued mission, reweighting sacrifice and interconnection. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. Purposeful elision (e.g., radio voices) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without momentum loss, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes vanishing ferries and time nets with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded character choices. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and inevitability in hindsight elevate originality.</comment>
