<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's cool-headedness is consistently embodied and crucial to the climax; her motivation to hear her daughter's echo drives the narrative with visible cost, and the final choice to voice silence is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren's insight reweights her worldview; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and cost is legible in her emotional release and the rail spike's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, with the stake to hear the echo tightening through garden shifts and the silence method; cost is unmistakable in her visceral response to the whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through particulars like the rail spike and constellations; the ending offers a non-literal answer with "fish for stars," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision (e.g., silence) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats like the silence moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism elements feels inevitable; risk-taking with concepts like sound wave garden and voicing silence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
