<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is robust with clear motives and internal conflict between her foolish disguise and intelligent actions. Her micro-choices, like adjusting embroidery upon overhearing plots, reveal consistent traits under pressure. The final decision to act is earned by prior causality, with cost implied in the risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent linkages from overheard whispers to Mira's realization of the conspiracy. Closure is a charged poise as she plans to warn the Queen, with cost legible in the red stitch marking danger. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the cobalt dome and autumn winds, constraining choices by hosting conspiracies. The eternal candle acts as a micro-setting that charges the final image by aiding synchronization. Specificity is purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with the coup threat, escalating through Mira's agency in piecing together intelligence. The tightening occurs when she realizes the purge, forcing her decision with visible cost. Under the causal lens, escalation is driven by her actions and narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring truth in silence and disguised wisdom.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and selective attention. Dialogue naturalism and subtext are effective when present. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story without scaffolding. No artifacts or loops obscure causality; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is fresh, synthesizing embroidery with espionage in a non-obvious way.
