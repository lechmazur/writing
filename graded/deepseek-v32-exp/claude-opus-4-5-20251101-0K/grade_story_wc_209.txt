<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's legacy, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as studying the glass layers and painting the mural, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to create the sanctuary is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her ongoing dedication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds, building through layers of discovery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the realization that beauty blooms for midnight wanderers reweights the premise with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in Mira's annual return to expand the mural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with vivid, POV-filtered sensory details. The environment directly shapes Mira's tactics and the closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in Mira's study and realization, driven by her agency. The cost is legible in her transformation of the pavilion and the emotional investment, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the postcards and glass layers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the mural's sanctuary, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical and reflective perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful, with rhythmic control enhancing the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "umbral tenderness" is precise and purposeful, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of art, botany, and legacy feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details like the etched glass transforming familiar themes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
