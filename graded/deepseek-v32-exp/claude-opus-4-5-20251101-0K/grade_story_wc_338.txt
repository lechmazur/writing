<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's methodical curiosity and map-framer profession are consistently embodied in her actions, such as cross-referencing footage and feeling the damp stone. Her motivation to interpret silence with empathy drives the narrative, and her final decision to type the report is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the chapel's whisper. However, her competence borders on flawless, lacking contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the chapel whispers, reconfiguring the meaning of silence under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with Elena's observations leading to the realization. The cost is legible in the final image, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault and henge stones constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like the "damp stone wall" and "mold and forgotten intentions" filtered through Elena's POV. The setting pressures her investigation and evolves consistently, supporting the theme of erosion and silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating differences in the footage, driven by Elena's agency under the accumulative lens. Her decision to type the report forecloses paths with felt cost, as the chapel's whisper reweights options. The tension operates at sentence and beat levels, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the map's tear and erosion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to boundaries and the unknown without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and images, such as the saints' fading expressions, inviting reflection on emotional truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elena's professional attention to "spaces between lines." Prose rhythm and diction remain controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in the comparison method. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences like "The rain had been working on the fresco vault for three hundred years" advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and momentum are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of map-framing, silent video comparison, and erosion feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the henge stones' changing expressions, avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
