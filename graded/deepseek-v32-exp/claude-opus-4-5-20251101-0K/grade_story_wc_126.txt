<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in her acoustic perception; her internal conflict is embodied in her frustration and eventual adaptation, with the final choice to play between silences earned by prior causality. The unbinding of the knot in her chest provides visible cost, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Marina accepts the chronic hush, with cost legible in the "unbind" and the changed silence; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The persistent constraint of the hush shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Marina's POV; the environment pressures her playing and mirrors internal states, achieving high specificity without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, as she shifts from fighting the hush to playing between sounds, with cost unmistakable in the unbinding and reconfigured silence. The dominant stake of overcoming silence tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of necessary silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose reflects Marina's mind state, and any elision (e.g., the chronic hush) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, and sentences advance story and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet resolution heightening stakes; specific details transform familiar tropes, and the premise offers a non-obvious angle on silence and resilience.</comment>
