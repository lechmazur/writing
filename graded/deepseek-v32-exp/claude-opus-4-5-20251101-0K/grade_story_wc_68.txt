<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority that is concrete and character-particular. His internal conflict over competing narratives is shown through on-page micro-choices, and his final endurance as preservation is earned with visible cost in isolation. The "abrasive calm" embodies contradictory emotions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with Marcus's decision to continue preserving, carrying felt cost in the chanting above and his solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sedimentary layers and artifacts, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of the New Covenant shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like the "seafarer's chronometer cog" and "sunken ruins," filtered through Marcus's POV. The sewer environment constrains his choices by enabling preservation away from zealots, and the artifacts charge the final image of rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving knowledge against erasure escalates under the Accumulative lens through Marcus's descent and artifact handling, narrowing his options. Agency in sealing the cog and continuing the mission has legible cost in the echoing chants and isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges organically from artifacts and Marcus's actions, with subtext in objects like the chronometer cog. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through preservation as rebellion, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct philosophical voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual signature (e.g., "abrasive calm"). No head-hopping; elision in reflection is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and character efficiently, e.g., "He agonized over these competing narratives every waking hour." Figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic preservation and philosophical rebellion, with specific details like sedimentary layers transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
