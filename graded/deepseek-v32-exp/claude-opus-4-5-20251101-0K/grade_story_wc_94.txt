<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "fiercely tranquil." Her final choice to speak is earned by prior causality—the note and timer—and forecloses silence with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the timer and opening the envelope, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elena speaks again, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from the timer to the note. The ending reconfigures her scars as maps, with cost legible in her voice emerging "raspy from seven years of silence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the stormlit observatory and timer constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and reflect urgency, such as lightning casting "shadow alphabets." The environment mirrors internal states and pressures tactics, like the storm answering with thunder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, with the timer countdown and envelope opening tightening options. The dominant stake—her internal conflict about speaking—deepens with cost legible when she decides to publish anew. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, like scars as maps and the vigil in pause, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the note and photograph, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The ending reweights prior material with resonance, such as light entering scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elena's poetic voice. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, as in "fiercely precise and impossible to cage." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, like "cartography of scars." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the storm, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in organic synthesis of elements, like the darkroom timer and censored poet, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity.</comment>
