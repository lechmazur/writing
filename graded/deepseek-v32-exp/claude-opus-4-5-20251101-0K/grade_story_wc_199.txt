<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wren's motivation is clear and rooted in her desire for meaning, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation is earned through prior causality, and the cost of her old self is felt, though the positive nature slightly softens the stakes. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Wren transforms, under the accumulative/textural lens, reinforced by the hush timeframe constraint. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the moonstone's dissolution and her blurred edges. The drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and moonstone tool constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Specificity is high, and the setting pressures Wren's decoding efforts, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Wren's agency during the hush, leading to transformation with conceptual cost on the page. The dominant stake (search for meaning) tightens through the leaf's invitation, and the accumulative lens supports the deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in leaves and monuments. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Wren's new role, avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression in the hush moment. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or overwriting. Figurative language is coherent and serves the climax, and the final image recharges prior motifs without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of skyborne arbor and transformative folklore, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the moonstone add irreplaceability.</comment>
