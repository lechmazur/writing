<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei-Lin's motivation is clear and rooted in past life memory, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Her micro-choices, such as guiding the old woman, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure, and her final decision to continue the pilgrimage is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in impulses are subtly handled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing through the final image of released love spiraling upward, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The past life memory surfaces as a causal trigger, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like jasmine blooms and creeping fog, selectively filtered through Mei-Lin's POV. The viaduct and camera obscura constrain choices and charge the final image, functioning as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding unused love is signaled early and escalates through Mei-Lin's agency in healing the old woman, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the woman's transformed breath and Mei-Lin's renewed purpose. No coincidence; resolution is earned through protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unused love emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in breath patterns and jasmine symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and selective attention to light and breath. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language and no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffolding. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of spiritual curiosity with practical healing, transforming tropes through specific details like breath photography. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
