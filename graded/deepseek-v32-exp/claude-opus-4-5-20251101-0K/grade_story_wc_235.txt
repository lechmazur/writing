<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is deeply interior and specific, with embodied emotions like jealousy of her past selves driving micro-choices. Her final renunciation of fear and decision to write toward the grave is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sharp twist beneath her ribs. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as envy warring with wonder, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera reconfigures her stance toward temporal chaos, felt in the cost of her jealousy and the grave's patience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in dream entries tightening pressure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending image of the wind smelling like an unmade memory charges the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, and grave function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like the scroll's crackle and the scent of birch are selective and POV-filtered, evolving with Vera's temporal confusion. The environment directly shapes her decision to climb the ridge, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increases in dream entries and Vera's jealousy, reweighting the stake of self-understanding. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, as her decision to write and climb forecloses the path of fear with cost legible in her envy. The dominant stake of temporal wholeness is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the grave and scroll, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to chaos versus narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the wind carrying unmade memories, and the ending reweights prior material through Vera's realization that chaos is the story. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional pressure. Purposeful compression in dream entries is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress, as in the line "jealous of the version of herself who had written these words."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "tasting something like wonder beneath the jade of her exhaustion" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure is undulled by scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of feral nostalgia and temporal confusion feels inevitable, with risk-taking in nonlinear narrative heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the birch bark scroll and grave transform familiar tropes through grounded character choices. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
