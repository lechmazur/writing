<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veloris's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a sentimentalist, with embodied emotion in carrying sorrows like seeds. Her decision to transmit light is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced in scene. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and the final hope carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as hope is introduced, cost legible in "fragile thing, easily extinguished." Accumulative lens holds with pattern break, and the gear acts as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the nebula garden and gear constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action, such as the flowers amplifying resonance. Spatial choreography is coherent, and micro-setting functions effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire escalates under accumulative lens through density increase and pattern break. Protagonist agency drives the turn via gear calibration, with cost unmistakable in the fragile hope. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking generational patterns emerges through events and imagery, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the unsolved equation of love vs. destruction, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in light and fire motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice. Diction and syntax reflect Veloris's otherworldly perspective, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences are concise and propulsive, enhancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic sentimentalism and resonance mechanics feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Core premise is transformed through specific choices, and emotional truth in hope elevates stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
