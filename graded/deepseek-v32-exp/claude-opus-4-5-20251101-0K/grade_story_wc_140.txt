<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "her fingers trailing rust and salt"). Micro-choices, like listening to the men and deciding to confront the doctor, reveal a hierarchy of values. Final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her "death" forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as she resolves to confront the doctor, a decisive change under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of her erased identity shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the shipping container labyrinth constraining choices (e.g., tide-based navigation) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "canyons of forgotten cargo and shadow," enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in uncovering erased histories escalates through protagonist agency, driven by overheard conversations and her decision to act. Cost is legible in her "dead" status altering tactics. Under accumulative lens, density increases with fragment layering, tightening options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. official records emerges through concrete particulars like the poison label and layered fragments. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of "monuments to the erased."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "The port city breathed with the rhythm of tides"). Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., fragmented stories) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "layer these fragments like sediment," is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story momentum, especially in peak beats like the overheard conversation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of tropes (e.g., "dead" investigator) through specific details like the tide rhythm and erased histories. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
