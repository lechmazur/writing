<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictions (fear vs. defiance) acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to swell the music is earned by prior causality—months of practicing heart rhythms—and carries visible cost as the statue cracks. The cicada shell realization transforms her understanding without diagnostic label-speak, anchoring growth in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the statues freezing and blossoms falling upward reconfiguring stakes. Cost is legible in the "statue cracked" and "silence had just ended," and the persistent constraint of soft music shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge constrain choices (statues climbing, bridge cracking) and charge the final image with upward-falling blossoms. Sensory details (rotting fruit smell, silvered planks) are selective and POV-filtered, evolving under pressure. The locust shell as micro-setting reweights meaning at closure, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency: signaling with heart rhythms and letting music swell with feeling. This tightens options, forcing the statue's climb and eventual cracking, with cost legible in the system's collapse. The dominant stake of freeing beauty deepens through a cadence shift that reweights silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cicada shell and music, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mechanical control without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (heartbeats, crumbling shell) and the final image reweights prior material. No thematic echo; the ending's "work of becoming free" arises from concretely earned struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Mira's urgency. Purposeful compression (heart rhythm signaling) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure ("her heart hammering") without register drift, maintaining rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("apple blossoms began falling upward") is coherent and enhances closure without muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, and peak beats avoid overwriting or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of enchanted policing and biological rebellion (cicada metaphor) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details (heart rhythms, locust shell) transform tropes through character choice, and the closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
