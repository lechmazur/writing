<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to embrace her true nature is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like tracing the scrimshaw. Her final dive is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her surface life with visible cost in leaving Jonas. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change as Mira dives and finds the island, reconfiguring her life with felt cost in separation from Jonas. The Causal lens holds tightly from Treaty to transformation to whale call, with no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of violence impossibility shapes the world logic without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the sublittoral fringe pressures Mira's transition, and the underwater mountain "wreathed in impossible light" reweights the stake. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with no generic placeholder or spatial confusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Causal lens, from the whale call narrowing options to her decisive dive. Cost is legible in Jonas's "combative tenderness" and her foreclosed surface life. One meaningful tightening suffices, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true freedom emerges through events and images, not statement, with the final dive offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the scrimshaw unlocking hearts, avoiding moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose and perceptual signature in Mira's aquatic bias. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Jonas's conflicted advice. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "the pressure embraced her transformed body like a welcome." Read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes Treaty of Still Waters, mermaid transformation, and disappearing island with specificity and emotional truth. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the final image feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
