<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deeply embodied, with frost in her hair and thorn-like nails showing her feral state. Her motivation shifts credibly from isolation to connection, triggered by the weeping woman, and her final choice to invite company is earned by prior interiority. The micro-choice of offering back the pendant reveals her hierarchy of values, with visible cost in her emotional thawing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Maren's invitation reconfiguring her solitude into connection, felt cost in her acknowledgment of loneliness. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with mist and frozen imagery deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the garden's decision motif pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with crystalline hedges and mist breathing like a beast shaping Maren's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting her POV, such as the pendant glinting like a false star. The setting pressures the narrative through its perpetual twilight, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, as the woman's weeping cracks her stillness, leading to a decisive invitation. The dominant stake of isolation vs. connection tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in Maren's admission of waiting alone. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of home as a relationship emerges organically from events, like Maren's dialogue on making friends with uncertainty, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared watchfulness in the mist. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the discarded pendant symbolizing rejected false paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Maren's voice rusty from disuse yet poetic, reflecting her feral state. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, as the woman's confession advances plot. Perceptual signature is strong, with frost-locked imagery and whispered books filtering through her consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "The frozen garden breathed mist" doing multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Syntax varies naturally, supporting the accumulative mood without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of a frozen garden at reality's edges, transforming guardian tropes through specific emotional detail. The non-obvious angle on home and connection feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, supported by vivid particulars.</comment>
