<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final action—confronting the hush-thing—is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is shown in scene, such as when he grips the lattice and speaks through it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the hush-thing shatters, reconfiguring Milo's stance with proof. Causal lens holds strong from father's letters to Milo's agency. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image charges the story with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the lighthouse prison confining impossibilities. The lattice object constrains Milo's action and charges the climax. Sensory details like "copperlight" and "salt-crusted windows" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the causal lens, from discovering letters to confronting the entity. Cost is legible when the hush-thing shatters, narrowing options and affirming his belief. Dominant stake of truth versus disbelief tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of belief and truth emerges through particulars like the lattice and father's letters, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Milo's witness, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Milo, with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "chasing hush." Voice modulates under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "honey-slow" copperlight enhances atmosphere without muddle. Sentence propulsion varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing the "cry wolf" trope with supernatural elements, transformed through specific details like the hush-thing. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing at closure feels inevitable, and freshness avoids template plots.</comment>
