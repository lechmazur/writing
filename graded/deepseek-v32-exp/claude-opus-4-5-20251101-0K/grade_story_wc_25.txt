<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celia's motivation and interiority are clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. However, lack of deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses slightly limits the characterization's complexity. Her final decision to guide the man feels earned but lacks significant cost or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the man finds his father's legacy, costing emotional revelation under the causal lens. Orientation is immediate, and causality holds tightly from footsteps to discovery, with the key template twist enhancing coherence. The storm's role in altering rules adds depth without breaking logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Celia's expertise. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, and spatial choreography remains clear. The geomagnetic storm actively pressures navigation, making the environment indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalating through Celia's agency in using the key and guiding the man, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the emotional payoff and effort, though the escalation lacks a major reversal. The journey deepens the dominant stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of whispers versus shouts emerges organically through actions and imagery, not statement, with subtext in dialogue and the final resonant image. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer through the labyrinth's secrets. Complexity avoids tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Celia's sound-based awareness; voice modulates with pressure and dialogue feels natural. No head-hopping or elision issues, though minor convergence in emotional peaks occurs. Rhythmic control supports the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity. Figurative language is purposeful, and the read-aloud test passes smoothly. Closure image is sharp without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of geomagnetic storms, folded maps, and labyrinth navigation, transforming tropes through specific details.
