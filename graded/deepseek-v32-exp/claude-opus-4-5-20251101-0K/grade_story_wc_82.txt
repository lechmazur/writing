<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to hang the lantern is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional release. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mei's cracked grief and Lin's transformed presence. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with orientation clear early. Persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating island tea garden and glass basilica constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the hybrid lens, from folding cranes to building the lantern and capturing the shadow. Cost is legible in her emotional torment and the transformation, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from grief to light emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lantern's light, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mei, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and any elision (e.g., dream recording mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly elevated in peaks like "luminous torment," but without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of dream recording and grief transformation, with specific details like origami cranes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
