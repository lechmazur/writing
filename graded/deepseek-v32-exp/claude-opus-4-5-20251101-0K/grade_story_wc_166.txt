<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selene and Kira exhibit clear, embodied motivations that intensify under pressure, with Kira's hunger for purpose rooted in specific loss. Internal conflict is shown through gaps in posture and hesitation, leading to an earned transformation. The final choice to undergo the ritual carries visible cost, though Kira's shift feels slightly swift but plausible in this accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Kira's anchoring forecloses belonging to the provinces. Under the accumulative/textural lens, pattern and density escalate through the ritual and dance. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden and obsidian pillars constrain choice as the exile site and ritual space, charging the final dance. Sensory details like "starlight pooled like spilled mercury" are selective and POV-filtered. The moonstone dust functions as micro-setting, actively shaping the climax with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory versus ban escalates through Kira's agency in choosing the ritual, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page: she becomes "spontaneously anchored" with permanent exile. The ritual deepens knowledge and reweights stakes, though escalation is more intensification than causal turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of exile as homecoming emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement, with the final dance offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like Kira's extended arm and the cosmic verses. No moralizing; complexity arises from particulars like the nostalgia ban's hollowness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Selene's perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Kira's whispered desire. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision (e.g., gaps in posture) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language like "obsidian grace" serving atmosphere without muddle. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentences advance story and character. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "cosmic verses gleamed") but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of tide dancing, nostalgia ban, and cosmic ritual, transformed through specific details like the moonstone dust. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
