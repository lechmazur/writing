<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Helena's motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pausing at noise) revealing her compulsion and courage. Interiority is concrete and embodied, and her endurance as a resilient figure is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in her isolated vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the final image of memory as "banked fire," reconfiguring hope under the accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with patrols as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist are vividly rendered and constrain choice (e.g., mist cloaking the broadcast), charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the radio dial functioning as a micro-setting that alters options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Helena's agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure from patrols and the broadcast risk tightening stakes. Cost is legible in her heightened vigilance, and the dominant stake (resisting famine) deepens through the spread of resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dust metaphor and broadcast impacts, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory's resilience. Subtext operates in gestures like the fox noise and song lyrics, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("thistled calm") and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (e.g., mist as cloak) is taught and paid off, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and syntax accelerates with scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dystopia and memory with non-obvious specificity (dust as storyteller), transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in the quiet, hopeful ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
