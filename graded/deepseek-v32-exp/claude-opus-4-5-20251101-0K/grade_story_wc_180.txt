<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve knowledge is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete, embodied through actions like touching the hair ribbon, and micro-choices under pressure reveal values. Petra's feistiness and steady fingers add depth, and their relationship forces choices that alter the story's state. The final decision to teach is earned by prior causality with visible cost of loss and renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the passing of the ribbon and teaching vow, reconfiguring options under a Hybrid lens. Causality is strong from breach to discovery, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of lost knowledge shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of life in impossible places.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard setting pressures choices through climbing and exploration, charging the final image with thematic weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, such as the amber light and glowing fruit. The environment constrains action and mirrors internal states, integrating seamlessly into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from the climb to the bag's discovery, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The dominant stake of preserving wisdom tightens with each beat, and cost is legible in the loss of the daughter and the effort to renew vows. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of persistence and generational wisdom emerges organically through events and symbols like the hair ribbon and deciduous vows, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the orchard and teaching, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, distinguishing characters through idiom and subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, with voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "fruit that glowed like lanterns," enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the journal discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes quartz-eye mending and cathedral orchard with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and risk-taking in setting heighten stakes without gimmickry. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the closure reconfigures familiar concepts of legacy with fresh inflection.</comment>
