<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses acting in scene, such as her reluctance to face the ghost versus engaging in negotiation. Her final renunciation of pretense is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in the ghost's dissolution. Micro-choices, like pocketing the camera wheel, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the ghost's dissolution and Mira's decision to move forward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through reflective density and imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the overheard story fragment triggers a decisive change without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon constrains choices by supplying debris and enabling memory slippage, charging the final image of perpetual motion. Sensory details like "luminescent waters churn" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV. The camera wheel as a micro-setting object reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency in negotiating with the ghost, culminating in her realization about fear. Cost is unmistakable in the ghost's dissolution and her renewed resolve. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the camera wheel and lagoon, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the lagoon never stopped moving," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the ghost's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue between Mira and the ghost is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Elision of time is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "fractured stillness," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes surreal setting and psychological depth with a non-obvious angle on regret. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
