<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in emotional conflict, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final reconciliation is earned through the lace decoding, with visible cost in the silent communication. Mr. Tanaka applies secondary pressure, enhancing the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the silent apology exchange. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with causality driven by the lace and compass. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the islet and lace constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mei's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency in decoding the lace and using the compass, under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake of emotional reconciliation tightens with cost legible in the foreclosed path of verbal apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies emerges through events and symbols, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the lace communication, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Mr. Tanaka's deliberate speech. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and cohesive, even in peak beats like the final reconciliation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of encoded lace and ghost compass, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in silent closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
