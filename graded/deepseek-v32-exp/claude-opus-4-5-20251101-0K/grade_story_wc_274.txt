<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hesitating over the key, thinking of her mother). Her final choice to broadcast the letter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in risking her mother's preservation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Mira's awakening and potential retaliation), under a causal lens that holds. The letter discovery triggers logical escalation to the broadcast, and orientation is clear by ~120 words. Cost is legible in "she felt awake" and the implied threats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the "perpetual cold" and "dizzying quiet" mirror Mira's internal state and complicity. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (snow muffling silence, crystalline chambers). The archive's environment pressures her decision through its symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: repairing the network, deciding to broadcast, and acting despite Vance's arrival. Dominant stake (moral integrity vs. safety) tightens with visible cost (risk to her mother). One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as complicity emerges organically from events and images (e.g., "silence was permission"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's awakening and the broadcast's impact. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (Mira's professional focus and emotional bias). Prose rhythm and diction reflect her urgency under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Vance's confrontation). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Lines advance story efficiently (e.g., "Her finger hovered over the activation key"). Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cryogenics and political corruption with fresh, non-obvious angle. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., archived minds as political tools). Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
