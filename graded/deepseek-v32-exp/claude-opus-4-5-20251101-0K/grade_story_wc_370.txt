<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Miriam's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of grief and empathy, with internal conflict shown through her actions and micro-choices.

Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from invitation to climax, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in Miriam's peace replacing guilt. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of her past mistake shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict between guilt and purpose escalates through protagonist agency in dialogue and realization, narrowing options with visible cost.
