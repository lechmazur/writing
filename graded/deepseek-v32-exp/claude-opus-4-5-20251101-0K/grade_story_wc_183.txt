<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and internal conflict shown through shifting memories. The final choice to tell their story is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sister's reluctance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as loneliness versus fragmented memories of her sister.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Maya convinces her sister to return, with felt cost in the fog thinning and sister's hand solidifying. The causal lens holds throughout, driven by Maya's quest. Orientation is clear early, and the constraint of memory loss shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details like the rusted Ferris wheel and salt-stained glass. The environment pressures Maya's actions, such as the carousel scene, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, from searching to persuading her sister, with cost legible in the sister's flickering form and the risk of erasure. The dominant stake of reclaiming memory tightens through meaningful turns, foreclosing the path of forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the Garden as erasure dressed in green, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and identity. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the emerald swatch card falling, without moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and dialogue advances plot with natural subtext. Perceptual signature is clear, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score. No head-hopping or unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language and no loops or scaffolds. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "drifted through the fog like a forgotten promise," and closure is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of memory and carnival tropes, transformed by specific details like the Chimera Twins posters. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth.</comment>
