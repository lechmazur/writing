<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like pressing the bolt plate. Her final decision to sing is earned by prior causality, and the cost is felt in the ghost's dispersal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (ghost dispersing, Mira's new purpose), under a consistent Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the misty courtyard and bolt plate constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully integrated through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in gathering and encoding messages, culminating in a climax with legible cost (ghost's dissolution). Stakes are clear and tighten under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about communication and permanence. Subtext is rich in the ghost's messages and Mira's songs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with lyrical, perceptual specificity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and organic, synthesizing ghost-in-code with art and memory. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
