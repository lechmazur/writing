<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply textured with concrete interiority and embodied emotion, such as her anxious retreat and the pulse of judgment from the glass paperweight. Her internal conflict between tenderness and combat is dramatized through micro-choices like tracing tea leaves and the decisive annotation. The final choice to mentor Kael is earned by her own exile history, foreclosing stagnation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira seals the annotation, reconfiguring her role and Kael's future under a causal lens driven by her reflection and Thessaly's dialogue. Cost is legible in the shifted shadow and her commitment to "combative tenderness." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints from her past shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory details like the grimy window and marble floors, filtered through Mira's POV to enhance atmosphere. The library and objects like the paperweight charge the final image but do not heavily constrain choices, preventing a 9+ score. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are purposeful without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, tightening through the tea leaves analysis and her internal debate, culminating in a choice that forecloses other paths with cost. The dominant stake of exile reversal is signaled early and deepens via her mentorship commitment. Cost is unmistakable in her annotation and the evening swing image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like broken reflections and the swing image, offering a resonant answer on redemption without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Thessaly's pointed dialogue. The final reconfiguration of "broken things reflecting light" deepens meaning through character struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "trapping a shadow like amber preserves a wasp." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Thessaly's remarks. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with elision taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "shadow like amber preserves a wasp," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Syntax varies naturally, supporting propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes fresh elements like shard-mirror archivists and reversible exile into an inevitable whole, transforming tropes through specific character choices.
