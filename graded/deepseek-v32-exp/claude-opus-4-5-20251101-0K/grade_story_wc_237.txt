<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with internal conflict shown through frost crystallization under stress and her decision to inscribe runes. Her motivation to transform her curse is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final choice to embrace her ice as a language is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the changed scar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Mira's transformation and realization, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in the iridescent scar and her resolved stance. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the floating platform isolates Mira, emphasizing the ritual's stakes, while the crow quill and scar act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from fear-triggered ice to active rune inscription, narrowing options and culminating in the shed of frost. The cost is unmistakable in the scar's transformation and her newfound understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: scars becoming stories, fear transformed into language, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of counting crows and reconfigured wounds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Mira's perceptual signature is consistent, and any elision (e.g., the held breath) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with lyrical yet precise language. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally to support emotional beats and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of magic, self-transformation, and specific details like the crow quill and tea ceremony. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
