<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in her past, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decision to send her father a photograph. Her internal conflict between extinguishing fire and containing it is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her scars and actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara realizes she must contain fire rather than extinguish it, reconfiguring her stance with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of imagery and reflection tightening meaning, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are integral, constraining choices and charging the final image with selective sensory detail. Environment mirrors internal states, such as the sand remembering heat, and pressures Mara's realization about transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, from collecting sand to building the memorial, with cost legible in her scars and father's letters. Dominant stake of reconciling with her past tightens through reflective deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like scars singing and black sand transformed, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through motifs of fire and compassion, deepening the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, such as noticing "kelp-drift peace," and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains coherent through lyrical prose, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "black sand slipped through Mara's fingers like cold ash," is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter and volcanic setting, transforming tropes with specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
