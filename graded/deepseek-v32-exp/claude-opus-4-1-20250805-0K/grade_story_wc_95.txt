<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's mechanical arm and backstory are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The final endurance of continued dialogue is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost feels slightly abstracted in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with conceptual cost (the coded framework for revolution), and the causal lens holds through logical syllogisms. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the sundial pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook are vividly sensory and pressure choices by mirroring the duel's precision. However, the setting doesn't fully constrain tactics, capping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the philosophical duel, narrowing options toward revolution. Agency is clear in both characters' syllogisms, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the duel, with the final image of the needle card promising questions as destinations. Subtext in coded angles avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable in Marlowe's perspective, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, though minor register consistency issues prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops. Figurative language like "scattering rainbows" is purposeful, and closure clarity is untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of philosophical dueling with coded resistance feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
