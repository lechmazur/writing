<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions (e.g., "brittle as autumn leaves") and internal conflict shown through actions like destroying her past while preserving others' truths. Her transformation is earned through prior causality, culminating in a balanced self-acceptance with visible cost in the healing heart. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Margot realizes messages travel through time, with cost legible in "healing heart." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of dust, letters, and meteorite. Orientation is clear early, and Theodore's revelation is earned, tightening the narrative with persistent constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the attic and dust motes constraining Margot's meditation and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., dust motes like constellations). The meteorite chip as a micro-setting object reweights meaning at closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict about identity) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases and seasonal progression, driven by Margot's agency in cataloging letters and confronting her past. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional journey and final healing, with one meaningful tightening in Theodore's revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reinvention and truth in omission emerges organically from particulars like letter cataloging and dust mapping, with subtext in gestures and silences. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("delivering us not to who we were but who we're becoming") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature tied to Margot's past (e.g., mapping dust like pigeons). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dust motes spiraled like constellations"), advancing story without overwriting. Clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, meteorite, paper trails) transformed via specific character choices and emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and turns feel earned in hindsight.</comment>
