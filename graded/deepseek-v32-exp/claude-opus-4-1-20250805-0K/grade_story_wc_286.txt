<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in her potter background, with embodied emotion and consistent micro-choices. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, though her final understanding is earned with visible cost in the wasteland journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing via Mei's realization about harmony and kindness, with cost legible in the fractured world and her journey. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early and persistent constraints (sun patterns) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the oasis and lantern glass constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (cracked earth, thrumming glass) are filtered through Mei's POV, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding resistance to change) escalate under the accumulative lens through density increases in imagery and revelation. Mei's agency in observation drives deepening, with cost felt in her journey and the oasis's perfection, though external conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the beekeepers' care and sun patterns, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (lantern glass, smoke) and earned wisdom from Mei's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Mei's perceptual signature is selective and biased, and purposeful elision (fractured timelines) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in dense imagery doesn't harm clarity or propulsion at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing fractured timelines with beekeeping harmony in a non-obvious way. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and specificity (lantern glass, phototropism) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
