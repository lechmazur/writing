<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaspar's guilt and redemption are concretely embodied through fidgeting with copper pieces and decoding the tapestry, with his self-forgiveness earned by the woven hush revelation. The final choice to forgive himself stems from prior causality, showing contradictory impulses of regret and hope. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "carrying the guilt served neither his student nor his future pupils." Hybrid lens holds: causal linkages from past failure to present action, and accumulative texture from the woven hush. Orientation is anchored early with who, where, when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the platinum labyrinth and tapestry force Kaspar's decoding, and the time-frozen village's suspended raindrops mirror his emotional stasis. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "raindrops hung like glass beads."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaspar's agency under the Hybrid lens: decoding the tapestry tightens his understanding, leading to self-forgiveness with cost ("carrying the guilt served neither"). Dominant stake (internal redemption) is signaled early and deepens through the woven hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges through particulars like the parallel between the frozen game and Kaspar's error, with subtext in the tapestry's threads. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the chess metaphor, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a lyrical, reflective texture ("the fierce repose of this temporal prison"). Perceptual signature is character-specific through chess-related imagery. No head-hopping; elision in the woven hush is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "lightning painted permanent veins." No register drift or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, time magic, and redemption feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightening stakes. The core premise transforms tropes through specific details like the woven hush and platinum labyrinth.</comment>
