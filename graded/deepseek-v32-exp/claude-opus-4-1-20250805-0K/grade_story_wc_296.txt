<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. The final choice to shatter the confession is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Kael shatters the frozen confession, releasing the full truth under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the seed's purpose shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cursed lake and garden of glass trees are vividly specific and constrain choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's POV to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from diving to discovering the truth to taking the seed. The cost is legible in his guarded expression and the pulse of the seed, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and deception emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed's purpose. Subtext operates in the ancestor's confession and Kael's realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is poetic yet consistent, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, enhancing the narrative's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports peak beats, such as "the spaces between truth and deception."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, like the flesh-eating seed as antidote, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the layered deception heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
