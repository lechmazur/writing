<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow's "mournful elation" and the ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" affection embody contradictory impulses in scene; the final liberation is earned through prior causality with visible cost in his weeping and the thaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the ghost bride's dissipation and dawn's return, costing Marlow his lifelong duty; causal lens holds via the bead's activation and debt revelation, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and stone bead constrain choices and charge the finale; sensory details like "luminescent fruits pulsed" are purposeful and filtered through Marlow's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost bride's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in Marlow's translucency and liberation; though Marlow is reactive, the stake tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of debt and freedom emerges through particulars like the cracked bead and thawing fields, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "winter-cracked fields," and elision (e.g., the debt's origin) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control without loops; figurative language like "crystalline frost" is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and ghost lore feels inevitable; risk-taking in the venomous love dynamic heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
