<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in dreams and past trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to rebuild is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her shifted perspective from survival to faith in persistence. Interior contradictions are shown in her admission versus true reasons for return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns of imagery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the sundial's completion reconfiguring Miriam's purpose. The structure is a single scene with one transition, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the catacomb orchard constraining choices (e.g., wandering paths) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Miriam's POV, and the environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between survival and faith) escalates under Accumulative lens through discoveries driven by Miriam's agency. Cost is unmistakable in her decision to rebuild, foreclosing her old path with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres and tightens with each revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (sundial, roots), with subtext in implication rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of time returning wanderers, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and character-specific, with natural dialogue and purposeful elision. No head-hopping; prose reflects Miriam's state and evolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports emotional beats and closure effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes with unique catacomb orchard setting feels inevitable. Risk-taking in blending life/death imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details and transformation of tropes through character choices enhance ingenuity.</comment>
