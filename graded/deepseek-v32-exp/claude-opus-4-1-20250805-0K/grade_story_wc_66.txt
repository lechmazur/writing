<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a copyist and her grandmother's legacy. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "thistled calm," and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., transcribing rebel songs) reveal her values. The final action—distributing scores—is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with cost in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the dust's potential return, with cost legible in Mariel's risk and the final image of her carrying scores into the mist. Causal lens holds tightly: pirate broadcast triggers transcription, leading to planned activation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (dust, regime) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (ember alcove, radio glow) and constrains choices, such as the radio dial adjustment sustaining the connection. The dust functions as a recurring object that charges the final image by carrying narrative potential. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mariel's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring stories—escalates through Mariel's agency: hearing the broadcast, transcribing rebel notes, and preparing scores. Under the causal lens, tightening occurs as she risks discovery, with cost implied in the forbidden act. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through art emerges implicitly from events like the pirate broadcast and dust mythology, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of dust remembering, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in song lyrics and Mariel's silent vigil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "thistled calm") that reflects Mariel's mindset. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., elision of dialogue) serves the narrative. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language (e.g., "foxfire burn") is coherent and enhances atmosphere without muddle. Sentence variety supports momentum, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dystopian control with musical rebellion and dust memory in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details (luminous notes, pirate broadcasts) feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
