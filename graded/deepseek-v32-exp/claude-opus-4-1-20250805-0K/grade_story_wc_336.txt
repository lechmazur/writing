<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her insatiably creative trait drives on-page actions, and the final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the Lumenwillow's growth) and felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights options with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the verdant parapet and waterfall constraining Mira's choice of planting site. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. The environment charges the final image, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) is signaled early and escalates through Mira's agency in weaving between worlds. One meaningful tightening occurs with the planting, foreclosing other options with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving wonder. No moralizing or thematic drift; complexity is embraced through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within Mira's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, without muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting exists but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of magical realism and specific details like the Lumenwillow. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold execution.</comment>
