<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing contradictory impulses; his final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the destruction of his business and files.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost under a causal lens; the watch hand and carvings create a coherent because/therefore linkage that tightens options, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the shore acting as a micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, as discoveries from the carvings narrow options and force a trade-off; cost is legible in his decision to abandon his livelihood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus comfort emerges organically from particulars like the carvings and watch hand; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Elias's state under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "sieved hush") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, and closure image is clear, e.g., "adding his own confession to this museum of tempered regret."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes genealogy and historical guilt in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes, and specifics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
