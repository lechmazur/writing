<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied interiority showing contradictory impulses (wildness vs. sculpted patience). Her seventeen-year endurance and micro-choices under pressure, like placing rods deliberately, earn the final revolution with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; flaws are balanced with competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("freedom always felt like falling"), under a consistent Causal lens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the viaduct's shift results from Kira's actions, with persistent constraints (17 winters, 73-hour window) shaping tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with basalt columns and frozen lake constraining choices (e.g., rods placed in cracks) and charging the final image (lake reflection). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and tone supports the theme of patient transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing humanity) is signaled early and escalates through Kira's agency under the Causal lens, with one meaningful tightening as rods redirect the viaduct. Cost is legible in the potential panic and transformation, foreclosing the old system. No coincidence or static conflict; escalation drives the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically through images (water freezing, moon paths) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of transformation, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, and earned wisdom arises from Kira's specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects Kira's focus and urgency. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Tomás's whisper). No head-hopping or register shifts; elision is purposeful, and voice coherence under pressure heightens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "basalt columns rose like organ pipes"). Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats, and grammar is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of revolution through patience and natural rhythms, transformed via specific details (moon paths, viaduct). Tropes are subverted (quiet upheaval), and emotional truth avoids templates. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
