<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's characterization is deeply embodied through her crystalline stress response, with internal conflict between shame and potential driving the climax. Her final choice to trace her scars is earned by prior causality, culminating in a visible cost as she sheds her crystalline formations. The memory of her grandmother provides a credible anchor for her transformation without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kira creates an original rune, reconfiguring her affliction into strength under a causal lens. The cost is legible in the shedding of crystals and Master Yuen's reverence. Orientation is immediate, and the structure tightens through her held breath and memory recall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating platform and crystalline skin function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details like the "saturated hush" and platform sway are filtered through Kira's stress, with the quill and parchment actively shaping tactics. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under causal pressure, as her stress-induced crystallization narrows options until she traces her scars. The cost is unmistakable in the shedding of shame and the rune's pulse. The dominant stake of creating an original rune is tested through a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Kira's transformation of flaws into strength, with the rhyme and crystallization serving as subtextual anchors. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the rune's dual meaning, avoiding moralizing. Specific particulars like the grandmother's wisdom deepen the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Kira's perceptual signature evident in her narrowed focus under stress. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the held breath) pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in Master Yuen's instructions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language like "liquid starlight" serving character and momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure causality; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with Kira's crisis. The final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of stress-crystallization and rune creation feels inevitable and fresh, transforming a personal affliction into narrative ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept is specific and irreplaceable, with emotional truth grounding the premise.</comment>
