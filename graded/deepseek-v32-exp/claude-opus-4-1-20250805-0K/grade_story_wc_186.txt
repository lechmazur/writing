<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; her retrocognitive blessing and stubborn refusal to abandon her post create credible micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her tears and realization. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid drive lens with clear orientation early; the closure is a decisive change (beacon rekindled, ships returning) with felt cost in Mira's tears and the conceptual repricing of darkness as structured hope. The shard's arrival and vision provide tight because/therefore linkage, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the glass humming pavilion's harmonics and the beacon tower constrain choices and charge the final image with anti-light. Sensory details (e.g., "crystal walls vibrating," "shadows that fell upward") are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mira's POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the hybrid lens through Mira's agency—using the shard to heal the prism and track displaced star paths—narrowing options and culminating in a cost-legible climax where anti-light illuminates new settlements. The dominant stake (rekindling hope) tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are less pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the shard of hush and prism fracture map impossible geometries, leading to a resonant, non-literal answer that coincidences are "conspiracies of light." Subtext operates through image and implication (e.g., "structured darkness" cutting through cosmic noise), avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mira's retrocognitive perception filters diction and rhythm ("feeling backward through time"). Prose compression (e.g., "shard of hush") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("hope drifted like thistle seeds") is purposeful and coherent. Minor density in peak beats ("shadows that fell upward") is pattern-taught and supports closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and fantasy with fresh inflection: the shard of silence enabling anti-light communication transforms tropes through specific world logic. Risk-taking in structured darkness and cosmic drift feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
