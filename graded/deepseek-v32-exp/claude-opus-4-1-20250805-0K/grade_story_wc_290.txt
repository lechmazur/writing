<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's claustrophobia and prudent adventure are embodied in micro-choices, with his fear and actions simultaneously driving the narrative; his transformation at the closure is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus's new understanding of mutable space reweights the premise with felt cost, and orientation is clear early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marcus's agency under the causal lens, as the organ music guides his decisions, narrowing options with cost legible in his transformation.</comment>
