<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amira's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic markers and micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Her endurance is earned through prior causality, and internal contradictions (panic vs. stillness) are dramatized in scene. The final persistence aligns with her traits without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Earned Stasis under an accumulative/textural lens, as Amira's alignment with growth reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("the world would continue its violence. She would continue her planting"). Orientation is clear early, and causality coheres through reflective anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choices (e.g., the cedar tree provides "pearl of stillness") and charges the final image with sensory specificity (salt, gulls, waves). Details are filtered through Amira's POV, integrating environment with internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increases in reflection and action, driven by Amira's agency (pruning, transplanting). The dominant stake (internal grief vs. growth) tightens with visible cost in her persistent cultivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (photograph, plants) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of growth against violence. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control ("The arboretum had outlived its keepers..."). Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("drones that moved like wasps") is coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of trauma and horticulture, with specific details (somatic markers, arboretum) transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
