<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits, with her "gently persistent wisdom" driving micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict between anonymity and leadership is embodied in actions like refusing credit, and her final renunciation feels earned by prior causality. Samuel's development adds relational pressure, though his role is secondary. The cost of her endurance is visible in her tiredness, scaling appropriately to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through patterned acts of giving, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community becomes self-sustaining. Closure lands with cost in Marta's fatigue and the bell's echo, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure of shards (midnight runs, community responses) is taught early and coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and antique bell function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "weathered columns" and the bell's "gentle toll" filtered through Marta's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent in food runs, and the setting evolves to become a "silent marketplace of dignity," directly shaping the community's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival and dignity escalates under the accumulative lens through Marta's agency, from initial donations to community-wide participation, narrowing options as sanctions persist. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and the community's unified silence against officials. One meaningful tightening occurs when she no longer needs to make runs, foreclosing her solitary role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous kindness and intergenerational support emerges through concrete particulars like the bell and food exchanges, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "anonymous footsteps," reweighting prior acts with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Samuel's unasked accompaniment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV from Marta is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in her "gently persistent" observations. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "benevolent shadows," and dialogue like "need has no face" carries subtext. Rhythmic control is evident in phrases like "forged in darkness and delivered through a thousand quiet acts," with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "forgotten prayer" is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality; the final line's echo lands cleanly. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of anonymous donations in a sanctions setting feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the bell and midnight runs. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in the community's "unified silence."</comment>
