<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's characterization is deeply rooted in her reincarnated memories, with embodied emotions like feeling the hum in her sternum. Her micro-choices, such as pressing and lifting the sundial, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final realization of coexistence is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation from isolation to independence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing: Kira's understanding that her purpose is coexistence, not recreation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through memories and resonance. Cost is legible in the final image where she casts a shadow, symbolizing solidity in this life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal library and atomically reflective sundial constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like clouds rolling beneath the glass floor. Setting pressures Kira's realization, and the environment evolves consistently with the atmospheric tides, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating isolation into independence is signaled early and escalates through Kira's agency under the accumulative lens. The hum of the stone circle deepens her knowledge, leading to a choice that forecloses isolation with felt cost in her transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges through particulars like the mammoth-herder memory and sundial reflections, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of casting a shadow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic prose with Kira's biased perception. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "brittle of transformation," without muddling peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reincarnation memories of extinct species with modern settings in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details like the tidal library and stone circle transform tropes through character-driven stakes. Risk-taking in structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
