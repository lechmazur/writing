<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits, with her pacifism and perception shown through concrete actions like teaching plants. Her father's change is earned through on-page micro-choices, such as sheathing his weapon, with visible cost in his exhaustion and recognition. Interiority is embodied without stock phrasing, and the final endurance as family is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the father's shift and their planting seeds reconfiguring their relationship. Cost is legible in "she saw something shift in his expression" and the shared act. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm constrains choices, such as Mira's movement between rows, and charges the final image of "impossible garden." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with the sandbag scrap evolving from ballast to seed pouch, integrating into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the father's return tightening the stake between violence and growth. Cost is visible in his sheathing the weapon and their planting, foreclosing his hunter path. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like "engraved quiet" and the roses' growth, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of planting seeds, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, noting "spaces between violence" and plants leaning "toward kindness." Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language like "prayer made solid" is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty hunter's pacifist daughter and "engraved quiet" feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in the quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept integrates fully with character and closure.</comment>
