<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's prism-mind is consistently embodied through multi-stream perception, driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation to continue the vigil is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in "the latent blaze of knowledge burned carefully controlled." Interiority avoids stock phrasing, with contradictions held without breaking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: doodle discovery triggers grotto exploration, leading to threshold revelations and closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Orin adopts the scribe role, with cost felt in the blood-mixed ink warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: gravity inversion forces stalactite navigation, and the grotto's mist "clung to them as they emerged." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "water droplets fell upward like silver rain," filtered through Orin's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under causal lens: Orin's compilation of doodles enables grotto entry, and crystal node contact reveals stakes. Dominant stake (preserving dangerous knowledge) tightens through learned consequences, with cost visible in the archived memories of collapse and plague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the doodles as "seeds of vigilance" reconfigure into Orin's role without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of controlled burning, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in "prism-mind" and multi-stream observations. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., syntax compresses during gravity shifts. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., threshold effects) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "The mist clung to them as they emerged, carrying the grotto’s secrets like condensation on glass." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fantasy and philosophical stakes through specific details like gravity inversion and prism-mind. Tropes are transformed (e.g., archivists as immune system), with risk-taking in non-linear perception heightening stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
