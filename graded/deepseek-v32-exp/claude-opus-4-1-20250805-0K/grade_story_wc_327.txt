<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "felt like dried lavender crumbling"). Final choice to become part of the canyon is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her physical transformation. Minor lack of internal contradiction, but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in her vanishing and the diamond's transformation. Orientation is clear within first paragraph, and the pattern of echoes and starlings pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—bone towers and canyon are essential for harnessing echoes. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "copper veins catching moonlight"). Micro-setting (diamond, starlings) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving Thuvenli) escalates through protagonist agency under accumulative lens: using the diamond, aligning with starlings, carving bone towers. Cost is unmistakable in her physical dissolution and the language's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and transformation emerges through particulars (e.g., diamond's curse, starlings' patterns) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the new language and her integration into the canyon, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—poetic, sensory, with a perceptual signature (e.g., "reading the ancient grammar in synchronized turns"). Rhythmic control under pressure; elision (e.g., starlings as conductors) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and serves the story (e.g., "crack like a frozen scream"). No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level rhythm supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis—copper-veined storyteller, cursed diamond, texture-based language—that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific details (e.g., bone towers) avoid derivative tropes.</comment>
