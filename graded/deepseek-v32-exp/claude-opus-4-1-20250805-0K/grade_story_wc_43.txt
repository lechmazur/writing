<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from diagnosis to project execution. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "serene on one side, fractured on the other." Her final choice to leave the recording and frame is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her impending death. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation forecloses paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of the cracked but whole circle. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of sound and symbolism. Orientation is clear early, and Maya's limited time shapes tactics. Persistent constraint of her timeline charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the rooftop garden and broken vinyl record constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "scent of hope" and sounds are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting elements alter tactics, such as the record's evolution in meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (leaving a meaningful legacy) escalates through Maya's agency in recording hospice sounds and creating the album. Under accumulative lens, density increases reweight stakes with cost in her limited time. Final action reunifies themes, narrowing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the broken record made whole, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on beauty in endings. Subtext operates in gestures and symbols without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, rhythmic prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; voice coherence under pressure, with elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and character, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing hospice care with artistic creation in a non-obvious way. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
