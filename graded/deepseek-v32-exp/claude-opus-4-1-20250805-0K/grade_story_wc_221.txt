<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kira's characterization is strong with clear motives rooted in her past and the blessed pariah duality; interiority is concrete and emotions embodied, though internal contradiction could be deeper. The final choice to become a fixed point is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear causality under a hybrid lens, with orientation anchored early; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where Kira becomes home for others, with cost felt in the temporal stretching and her sacrifice, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the observation deck and compass rose constraining choices and charging the finale; sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Kira's POV and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant early, escalating through Kira's agency under the hybrid lens; her decision to sketch the constellation narrows options and carries cost, foreclosing her isolation with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of true north as a fixed point emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like sketching and the compass rose's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language is integrated without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation and navigation tropes through specific choices; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
