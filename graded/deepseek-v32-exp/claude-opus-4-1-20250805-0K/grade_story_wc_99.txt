<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing the lace) revealing his grief and motivation. His final decision to write to Yuki is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the unsaid words. The student serves as a secondary pressure, but Kenji's arc dominates with credible emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns (lace, compass) to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Kenji's decision to write forecloses his silence with felt cost, reinforced by the Mizukage's bell toll. No causality breaks; closure lands with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective (e.g., "silver droplets," "salt and green smell"), filtered through Kenji's POV. The environment constrains choices: the lace and compass charge the final image, and the islet setting subtly mirrors internal states. Micro-setting elements like the juniper and porch integrate into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kenji's internal conflict over Yuki) escalates under the accumulative lens through lace readings and compass behavior, culminating in his agency to write. Cost is legible in the realization of unsaid words, narrowing options meaningfully. One tightening is sufficient, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and reconciliation emerges organically through particulars (lace patterns, compass, bonsai) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Kenji's decision, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Kenji's voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, modulating under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., lace encoding) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "color of cerulean regret"). No register drift or artifacts harm closure; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bonsai, lace encoding, and ghost ship compass feels inevitable, with specifics grounding emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes are transformed through character-driven choices, and the final image recharges prior motifs.</comment>
