<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's wish, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied in moments like feeling warmth leave her chest. The final choice to set down the palette is earned by prior causality and shows visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ test with contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible when Mara feels something leaving her chest; the accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and the persistent constraint of vitalization's cost shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the archipelago and palette constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "molten copper water" are filtered through Mara's POV and integrate into action, meeting the 9+ test for environmental impact on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of completing the vitalization versus preserving her own capacity escalates under the accumulative lens, driven by Mara's agency in realizing the cost and choosing to set down the palette; cost is unmistakable on-page, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of luminous absence emerges from events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through "longings meant to remain ciphers"; subtext operates in gestures like the figure's smile, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical prose like "the archipelago spoke only at dawn"; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., photography cover) is taught and paid off, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and supports momentum, with no artifacts in peak beats, fulfilling the 9+ test for clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is original with a fresh synthesis of light-painting and memory vitalization, transforming tropes through specific choices; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting the 9+ test for inevitability and ingenuity.</comment>
