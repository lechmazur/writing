<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "joints stiff from hours of kneeling." The final choice to complete the map is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in physical strain and altered orchard state. No internal conflict, but dedication drives credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the collapsed pattern and stiff joints; accumulative lens holds throughout, with pattern completion driving the arc. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (patience, time) shape tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., inverted trees influencing pattern work) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "aurora lights flickered green." The crater environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating the map) is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with cost visible in the pattern collapse and physical toll. One meaningful tightening occurs as the world holds its breath, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as translating heartbeats into maps, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the completed plate, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet precise, e.g., "with the deliberate care of someone threading memories." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "light remembered." No overwriting or clarity loss in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, synthesizing alchemy with magical realism; turns feel inevitable in hindsight, such as using inverted tree sap. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
