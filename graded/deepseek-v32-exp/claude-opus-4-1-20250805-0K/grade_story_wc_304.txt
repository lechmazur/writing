<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her dual role as beautician and mortician. Her internal conflict and careful actions under pressure reveal character through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final choice to create the threshold is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the frozen grotto and achieved suspension. The Accumulative lens holds, with escalation through the Silence's approach narrowing options. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining Mira's movements and charging the final image with the skyborne grotto and aurora. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment pressures choices and supports the theme, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and signaled early, with escalation driven by Mira's agency against the Silence under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the grotto's transformation and the achieved almostness. Protagonist actions narrow options and redefine the conflict with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring beauty, death, and threshold without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure.
