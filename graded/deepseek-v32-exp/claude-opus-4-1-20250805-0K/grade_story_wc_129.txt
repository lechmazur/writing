<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to graft onto the community through art is clear and consistent, driving key choices like initiating the search. Interiority is shown through embodied actions and dialogue, though internal conflict is subtle rather than deeply contradictory. The final collaboration with the first artist is earned by prior causality, with cost in the exile and reintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from Kira's arrival to the closure, with because/therefore linkages in the search and discovery. Orientation is early and clear. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community's unity and the arbor's completion reflect belonging, with cost legible in the first artist's tears and the shared effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater are vivid, sensory-rich, and constrain choices—the arbor's evolution and crater's path directly shape the plot. Setting charges the final image as a mirror, integrating POV bias and environmental pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging and artistic legacy escalates through Kira's agency in leading the search, narrowing options to the crater's heart. Cost is felt in the community's collective effort and emotional resolution, though the climax is slightly soft, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of community, art, and belonging emerge organically from events like weaving stories and the search, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the arbor as mirror, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Kira is stable and distinct, with poetic yet controlled voice and natural dialogue that advances plot. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., tag origins) is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but clear, with high information density, varied rhythm, and no artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language serves pressure and closure, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crystalline setting, forgotten languages, and community art feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with freshness.</comment>
