<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as his decision to deliver the thunderstorm bottle despite regulations. His internal conflict between duty and rebellion is shown through action, and his final understanding is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Ezra's realization reconfigures his role into an "act of faith," under an accumulative lens that builds through imagery and theme. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the border constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade setting pressures choices by serving as a neutral ground for drone deliveries, with sensory details like "neon tubes casting uncertain shadows" filtering through Ezra's POV. It charges the final image and constrains action, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of fostering connections escalate through Ezra's agency in delivering the bottle and meeting the Keeper, under an accumulative lens that deepens meaning. Cost is legible in the ending reflection, but escalation lacks multiple tight turns, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges organically from events like the bottled storm and drone deliveries, with subtext in imagery and a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; the conclusion reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic prose and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, though dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong propulsion, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "cobalt cathedral of broken promises" is consistent and legible, though slightly ornate in peaks, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mail delivery, drones, and bottled storm with specificity and emotional truth, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
