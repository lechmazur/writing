<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage's characterization is strong with consistent traits and embodied emotions; her motivation intensifies from distrust to active pursuit, driven by ancestral gifts. The final choice to guide others is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her retirement ending. Minor weakness: some interiority could be more contradictory under pressure, but overall, micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkages from inciting incident to closure; orientation is anchored early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Sage's howl signifies a decisive change from retirement to a new purpose, with felt cost in her renewed commitment. The lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details; the scrapyard and hidden valley pressure choices and charge the final image. The leaf and phonograph function as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Specificity reflects Sage's POV, and environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled as translating loss into connection; escalation is driven by Sage's agency under the causal lens, from receiving revelations to the journey. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf's map guides her, foreclosing retirement. Cost is visible in her altered role, though the escalation could be more intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the leaf and valley, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to distance and closeness through Sage's new purpose. Subtext operates in implication, but minor moralizing in the child's dialogue slightly reduces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature; prose reflects Sage's mindset with rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency could be tighter under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and the final line resonates with earlier motifs. Minimal scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-human POV and synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements with unique concepts like phonograph revelations. Tropes are transformed through specific choices; the premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with structure and perspective heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
