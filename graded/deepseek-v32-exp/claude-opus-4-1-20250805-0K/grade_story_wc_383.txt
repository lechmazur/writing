<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply rooted in contradictory impulses as a charmed skeptic, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final integration of memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the digging and dawn transformation. Minor diagnostic language ("Cognitive Quarantine Program") is present but not in peak beats, avoiding significant deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—Marina's integration of memories—under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the final image of the "whole but scarred" seashell and her transformed self. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the seashell's constraint shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden and seashell function as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., digging location) and charge the final image with sensory specificity. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the causal lens, from whispered clues to digging with bare hands, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in the dirt under her nails and the dawn transformation, foreclosing her prior isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory integration without moralizing. Subtext operates in the seashell's whispers and the garden's transformation, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and lyrical, with purposeful elision (e.g., memory fragments) taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of quarantined memories stored in a seashell is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose and memory architecture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
