<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is strong with embodied somatic markers and credible motivation; David's transformation from skeptic to participant is earned through on-page interactions. Minor diagnostic speak in "somatic markers she'd learned to read like sheet music" edges toward therapy-language but is dramatized with cost. Final choice to illuminate pathways is rooted in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as David's participatory wonder reconfigures stakes; cost is legible in the illuminated architecture making permanent what was temporary. Causal lens holds from accident to demonstration, with orientation clear within first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Light painting studio functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., projector adjustments) and charges the final image; sensory details like "pulsed faintly in the darkness" are selective and POV-filtered. Geode sliver recurs with purpose, though spatial choreography has minor ambiguity in light coalescence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating hidden pathways) escalates through Maya's agency in crushing the pill and demonstrating light structures, narrowing options under causal lens. Cost is felt in David's transformed stance and the conceptual price of revealing human connection without medication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as tangible connection emerges through particulars like the geode's fractals and light-painted corridors, avoiding moralizing. Ending offers non-literal answer with "pathways to understanding each other had always existed," reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV (Maya) is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "somatic markers sang with certainty"); dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in phrases like "willowglass hope" is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control (e.g., "dendrites of possibility branching through space"); no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy pills, somatic markers, and light painting feels inevitable; risk-taking in hybrid causal-textural lens heightens stakes without gimmickry. Concept transforms tropes through specific lived detail and moral calculus.</comment>
