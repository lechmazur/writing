<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. The trait of "warmly inquisitive" is demonstrated through actions like organizing Thorne's study and decoding the goggles, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Mira understands Thorne's transformation, with felt cost in her renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details like the elevator floors and decoded messages. Orientation is clear early, and the climax is causally linked to her actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire setting pressures choices, such as the elevator's ascent mirroring Mira's internal climb, and charges the final image with the cold environment contrasting warmth of discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "frost-etched window" and "amber bulbs," filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as each floor reveals new clues, narrowing options and deepening stakes. The cost is legible in her transformed perspective, foreclosing her prior isolation with a visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, such as the diary entries encoding joy, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to sorrow without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the goggles projecting light, and the final reconfiguration avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic yet precise prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in the rhythm of the elevator's ascent, and any elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, like "ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones," and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of encrypted grief transformed into joy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis, risk-taking in its quiet plot. Specific details, like Thorne's shorthand and the astrolabe, make it inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
