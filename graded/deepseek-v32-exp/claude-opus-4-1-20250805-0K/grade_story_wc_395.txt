<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, driving her investigation. Her final choice to join the archived is earned by prior discoveries, with visible cost in leaving her old life. Minor flaw: "brightly attentive" feels slightly label-like, but interiority is otherwise concrete and embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Lila becoming Pattern User 8625, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly from investigation to transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the Apollo-X frequency tie-in strengthens causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image of digital ghosts. Sensory details like "towers of obsolete servers" are filtered through Lila's POV, integrating environment with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila's agency as she decodes clues, narrowing options to a pivotal choice. Cost is legible in her transformation, foreclosing her previous life. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of digital presence/absence emerges organically through events and images, like the archived communicating through patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct tech-noir perceptual signature. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., encoded messages) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language like "digital ghosts" enhances without muddle. Minor label in "brightly attentive" doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes digital archaeology and archived consciousness with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the shadow network concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details anchor freshness.</comment>
