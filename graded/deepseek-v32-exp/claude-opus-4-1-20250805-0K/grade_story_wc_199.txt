<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with concrete interiority and contradictory impulses shown when she chooses not to report the moonstone dust. Her transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her physical change and moss growth. The final choice to embrace her role as translator feels inevitable and rooted in established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with Mira's awakening charging the final image. The cost is legible in her physical transformation and the arbor's satisfaction. The lens holds consistently, and the moonstone speck's role shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices through the arbor's petrified branches and humming seeds. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, with the environment charging the closure via upward-falling leaves and moss growth. Micro-setting elements like the seeds and moonstone directly influence the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from prodding the moonstone to building monuments, reweighting stakes toward the trees' choice. Cost is unmistakable in her transformation and the mossy delight. The dominant stake of personal and arboreal destiny tightens meaningfully, though it remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like seeds and monuments, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of memory and connection. Subtext operates through leaf patterns and moonstone lore, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Mira's professional focus. Voice modulates under pressure, maintaining rhythm and clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor density in peak beats slightly tempers score. Sentences advance story and atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes mythic and personal elements into a fresh, inevitable whole, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specificity in details like seed sorting and moonstone dust avoids derivative premises. Emotional truth and transformation feel authentic and unrepeatable.</comment>
