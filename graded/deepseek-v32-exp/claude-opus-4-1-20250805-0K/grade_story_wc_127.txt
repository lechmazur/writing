<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is concrete with embodied emotions and clear motivation; her internal conflict between professional detachment and the pull to subsume emotions is dramatized in scene, and her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tingling static electricity). Micro-choices like resisting the urge reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible on the page ("static electricity still tingled on her fingertips"). Hybrid drive lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds without ambiguity; the grotto's transformation tightens pressure coherently. Orientation is clear within first paragraph, and persistent constraint (cardinal rule) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Vera's POV; the amber grotto constrains choices by its dusk transformation and charges the final image. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting, altering tactics. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Vera's internal conflict between harvesting and consuming emotions) escalates under the Hybrid lens via protagonist agency; the intensifying static electricity and temporal pressure force a tightening choice with cost (emotional detachment). One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths as mercy emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, e.g., the amber preserving incomplete emotions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature reflective of Vera's profession; voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., grotto's transformation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "pools of liquid gold." No overwriting or coherence issues in peak beats; sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original and non-obvious, synthesizing emotion dealing with amber preservation; specific details (blotter petal, static electricity) feel indispensable. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation test passed.</comment>
