<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's observant nature is concretely embodied through her journal and actions; her final offering of the shard is earned by prior causality with visible cost, demonstrating micro-choices under pressure and a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (offering the shard) under an accumulative/textural lens; the pattern of displaced objects is taught early and pays off, with orientation anchored within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the bay acting as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details like the "hush so complete it blazed" are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, from noticing changes to understanding offerings; cost is legible when she sacrifices the shard, foreclosing a path with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sanctification through loss emerges organically from particulars like the houses' offerings; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, deepened by subtext in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, e.g., "hush so complete it blazed," and elision (like the shard's purpose) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "silence—it was the active presence of quiet" is coherent and heightens pressure in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of magical realism and grief; the concept of "crystallized hush" feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
