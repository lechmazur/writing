<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply interior and contradictory, with embodied emotions (trembling hands, laugh like bark) and micro-choices (writing, stepping outside) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her jealousy of past selves and motivation to distill chaos drive credible endurance, and the final choice to step outside is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing undermines the complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the soaring moment, reconfiguring options with conceptual cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the time-confusion pattern is taught early and pays off at closure. The persistent constraint of nonlinear time shapes tactics and the final image, with cost legible in the "exhausted amazement."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (crackling scroll, cold glass, birch sap scent) filtered through Maya's bias. The ranger cabin and birch bark scroll function as micro-settings that constrain choices (writing, stepping out) and charge the final image of soaring, meeting the 9+ test. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (order vs. chaos in narrative) escalates under the accumulative lens through Maya's agency—reading scrolls, writing, and stepping outside—narrowing options with legible cost (jaded wonder, acceptance of chaos). The deepening is driven by protagonist choices, and the cost is unmistakable in the closure moment, though it relies more on conceptual than visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (scrolls, grave, flying), with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and realization that "narrative itself is chaos," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects Maya's fragmented consciousness ("chronology tangled like mountain paths"). Elision of time is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping. Diction and syntax control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("laugh like bark peeling") is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting is present but does not harm propulsion or closure clarity, and there are no register drifts or template cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dream chronicling and time confusion, transformed through specific details (birch bark, grave visit) and emotional truth. Risk-taking with nonlinear narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. The element of feral nostalgia and self-jealousy adds a non-obvious angle.</comment>
