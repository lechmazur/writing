<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as his decision to photograph rather than take the valve wheel, earning the final renunciation with visible cost. His Methodist skepticism roots his motivation, intensifying under pressure from the radio calls, and his internal conflict between belief and respect for stories is dramatized in scene. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like curiosity balanced with genuine struggle drive inevitable choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marcus leaves the valve wheel, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens, which holds consistently. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from radio calls to discovery, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of collective guilt shapes tactics and the final image, with cost legible in "the weight of that swallowed truth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "sweating brick walls" and "pipes that ran along the ceiling like the mill's circulatory system" filtering through Marcus's POV. The tunnel environment constrains choices and charges the final image, as the valve wheel's location behind a rusted junction box alters his decision. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appraising "the weight of a swallowed truth" is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase from radio confessions, leading to Marcus's agency in not taking the valve wheel. The cost is legible in his carried "weight" and the foreclosed path of possession, with one meaningful tightening that reweights options. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres until the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, memory, and confession emerges organically through events and images, such as the radio calls and the beaded valve wheel, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the valve wheel left "between confession and absolution," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication and silence, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's "Methodist upbringing" and "drowsy alertness" coloring his observations. Voice modulates with pressure, and radio dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext that advances plot. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in radio static is taught and pays off at closure with legible effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "metal tombstones" is purposeful and coherent, and diction stays within Marcus's lexicon. No register drift or template cadence; clarity and momentum persist through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of ghost shift legend, radio calls, and the beaded valve wheel, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the final reconfiguration is bold and coherent.</comment>
