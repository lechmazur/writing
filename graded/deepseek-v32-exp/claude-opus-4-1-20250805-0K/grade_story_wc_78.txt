<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her collapse. The character's flawed yet competent struggle balances genuine effort with transformative agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the current's release and Kessa's new mission, offering a resonant reconfiguration under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her physical collapse and the mallet's pulse, and orientation is anchored early. The structure is tight, with causality driving escalation without coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constraining, with the driftwood orchard and blue hour filtering through Kessa's POV to pressure choices. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, such as the salt-kissed branches and resonant wood nodes. The environment charges the final image by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kessa's agency under the hybrid lens, with her sketched resonance building pressure to disrupt the fractal current. The dominant stake of escape tightens through causal linkages, and cost is unmistakable in her physical exertion and ongoing duty. Protagonist choices narrow options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, centering on transforming obstacles into instruments without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new coordinates and pulsing mallet, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, though the final line slightly risks explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Kessa's expertise and urgency. POV is stable and single, with diction and rhythm modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision, such as cloud-script interpretation, is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the resonance disruption. Line-level craft is polished, with strategic telling and concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements like sketched resonance and cloud-script into an organic whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details and character-driven choices, with risk-taking in imagery heightening stakes. Originality feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting closure without gimmickry.</comment>
