<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassia's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a failed revolutionary, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her voice growing thick with unshed tears. The final choice to devise a resurrection plan is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her burnished sorrow. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise as Cassia devises a plan to resurrect the Venusians, reconfiguring options with felt cost. The Hybrid drive lens (Causal-Accumulative) holds, with causality in her revelations and textural density in time streams. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her defeat shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of sorrow burnished bright.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the baroque asteroid and visible timestreams pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful, like the shard bending light and mirrors showing possibilities. The environment constrains tactics, such as the temporal storm affecting the scene. No generic placeholder setting; details are integrated through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archaeological dispute and civilization resurrection) escalates through Cassia's agency under the Hybrid lens, as she reveals the shard's power to shift Huang's curiosity. Cost is legible in her emotional state and the foreclosed path of defeat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghosts appear, narrowing options. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as defeat preparing for victories, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like covered mirrors and the shard's pulse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lens of sorrow transforming into clarity. No moralizing or thematic drift; complexity is embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV from Cassia is stable, with a distinct poetic voice reflecting her character and stress. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Huang. Perceptual signature is selective, such as noticing how time streams bend. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "frozen tears" and "liquid history." No loops, scaffold, or overwriting obscure closure; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes with natural modulation. Minor density in peaks is functional and not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes elements like visible time, baroque asteroid, and memory maps into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, such as using archaeological dispute for thematic depth. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth is specific and durable.</comment>
