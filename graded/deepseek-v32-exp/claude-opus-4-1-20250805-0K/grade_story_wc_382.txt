<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her obsession with building whispers, with concrete interiority and micro-choices like producing the seal. Marcus's revelation about his grandmother adds depth. The final choice to teach is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in their shared commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara starts the first lesson, reconfiguring their relationship under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the building's midnight recitation and their shared understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower create a vivid atmosphere, with sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. The setting constrains choices by serving as the meeting place and charges the final image with the building's whispers and celestial display.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with Marcus's request to learn forcing a trade-off.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "agreed upon lies" in architecture emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the start of lessons, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Elara is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending academic and poetic diction. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, with no head-hopping; elision in building whispers is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Minor ornate phrasing in peaks doesn't harm clarity, and propulsion is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of buildings speaking is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis with dead languages, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
