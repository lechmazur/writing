<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>M-47's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to burn the fears is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is shown through fragmented memories. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as M-47 achieves "fragmented wholeness," with cost legible in the burning fears and transformation. Causal-Hybrid lens holds strong from magnetic shift to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "ceramic fingers" and "organic roots" filtered through M-47's POV. The glass dome and magnetic shift pressure actions, and recurring objects (roses, box) reweight meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by M-47's agency under the causal lens, with the controlled burn sequence narrowing options and imposing cost. Dominant stake (resolving inner static vs. ecosystem collapse) tightens meaningfully, and the cost is unmistakable in the ash-enriched soil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on preservation and transformation. Subtext operates in gestures like the burning fears, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting M-47's synthetic-organic duality. Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "wings of flame" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of android caretaker and emotional archaeology, with tropes transformed by specific details. Risk-taking in blending sci-fi and lyricism heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
