<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict dramatized through her involuntary honesty. Her final choice to reveal the bees is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her confession. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as clutching the lacquer box, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Mira's confession and the citizens' wonder, under a causal drive lens that holds. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages, from the blackout to the reveal, with orientation anchored early. The final image of bees radiating hope reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the lightning tower constraining choices by enabling Mira's power theft for the bees. Sensory details like "amber sky" and "copper coils" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The tower as micro-setting charges the final image, supporting atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival escalates under the causal lens through Mira's agency, from hiding bees to public revelation. Cost is legible in her confession of theft, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of nature vs. technology emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the bees' "ancient dance" contrasting with failed drones. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of bees as hope, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the child pressing against the glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mira's biased noticing of "nectar-sweet air." Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "thick, sweet, necessary" confession. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; examples like "wings catching the dusk light like drops of liquid gold" are coherent. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dystopian tech failure and involuntary honesty with fresh, specific details like the lacquer box. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, e.g., bees as salvation rather than cliché. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
