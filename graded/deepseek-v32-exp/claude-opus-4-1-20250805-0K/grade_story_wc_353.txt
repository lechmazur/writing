<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, limiting depth. Her competence and empathy are well-shown, but the absence of flaws or struggles reduces the cost of her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens, as the music and etched insulator reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a single scene progression, though the drive lens is slightly ambiguous before midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the alder grove and porcelain insulator constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her strumming intensifies the stakes toward the symphony's creation, with cost legible in her effort and the insulator's etching. Dominant stake of restoring sound is consistently pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as the tree's scars and the music, offering a resonant answer on memory and compassion without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, enriching the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's expertise and empathy. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no muddle in peak beats, such as the strumming sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of silence and sound memory, with specific details like the porcelain insulator transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
