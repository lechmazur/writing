<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ira's motivation to prove time moves sideways is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like adjusting the lever despite alarms. Her internal conflict between duty and passion is dramatized, and the final renunciation of safety for discovery is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Ira's realization reweights the universe's rules, with cost legible in the station's shudder and Vasquez's alarm. The Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, and the magnetic nexus constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filters through Ira's POV, with the magnetic nexus and containment fields constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "amber glow" and "icy warmth" are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ira's agency with the lever, causing resonance that narrows options and imposes cost (station shudder). Under the Hybrid lens, this deepening is driven by protagonist choice, and the cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as a web emerges through events and images like the creatures' subdued awakenings, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic diction. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "time folded and unfolded like origami" is purposeful and clear, though slightly purple in peaks, without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes xenobiology and temporal physics with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is freshly resonant.</comment>
