<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his ghost-seeing ability post-accident, driving his investigation. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like dust analysis revealing character under pressure. The final commitment to expose the corruption feels earned, though his emotional range is somewhat contained without deep contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages: ghost sighting prompts investigation, leading to journal discovery and conspiracy unveiling. Closure is a decisive change—Marcus gathers evidence, ghosts fade—with cost legible in the building's "exhaled" peace. Orientation is immediate, and the hybrid lens holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "dust motes spiral" and "dying wasp" buzzing, creating a haunting atmosphere. The abandoned circus ticket office constrains choice, as dust patterns guide Marcus to the hidden journal, charging the final image of revealed truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal ghostly encounter to uncovering systemic corruption, driven by Marcus's agency in analyzing dust and retrieving journals. Cost is felt in the ghosts' vigil ending and Marcus's resolve to act, under a causal lens that tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and redemption emerges organically through the ghost's guilt and the mainspring barrel's symbolism. Subtext operates in gestures like Teresa's pointed finger, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through "every broken thing could still be fixed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic observation ("cables singing") with professional focus. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., grandmother's backstory) is taught and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "The fluorescent flickered back to life, buzzing like something trying to break free" advancing atmosphere and plot. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story synthesizes ghost lore with mechanical failure and corruption in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the horologist's mainspring barrel. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
