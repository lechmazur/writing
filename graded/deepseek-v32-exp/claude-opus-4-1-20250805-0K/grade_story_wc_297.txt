<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's root-bound nature and purposeful curiosity are concretely embodied in micro-choices like collecting evidence and tracing scars, with motivation intensifying under pressure. Minor reliance on labeled emotions like "anxious elation" slightly dulls peak beats, but internal conflict is shown through trembling hands and anxious elation, earning her final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot coheres under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens, with closure landing as a decisive change when Mira signs the covenant, cost legible in "roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing." The persistent constraint of being root-bound shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is vividly specific and constrains choices, charging the final image as it "pulsed with anxious elation" and parted to reveal scars. Sensory details like "blue grass catching the last angles of sunlight" are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency, with the maze growth and scar tracing tightening options toward the intersection, cost felt in her "trembling hands" and realization of her role as anchor. Dominant stake of restoring the covenant is signaled early and deepens under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of root-bound anchoring emerges implicitly from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing." Subtext operates through scars and the eclipsed covenant, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature clear in Mira's way of noticing "scars like braille" and patterns. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., time folds) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "electricity through water" slightly muddles clarity in peak beats. No major loops or scaffolds obscure closure, and sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time folds, eclipsed covenant, and root-bound visionary feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in poetic abstraction heightening stakes. Specific details like linking through scars transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
