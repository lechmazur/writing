<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in defiance and artistry, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her impending capture, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—authorities will come for her—under the accumulative/textural lens, which holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of exile shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the twilight garden and moonstone dust charging the final image by holding her imprint. However, the environment does not strongly constrain choices, preventing a higher score despite its atmospheric richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, from dance to transformation, with cost legible in her imminent capture. The stakes of defiance tighten meaningfully, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of art as resistance emerges organically through images and actions, with a non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the cosmic verse embodying defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—lyrical and consistent—with a perceptual signature focused on celestial imagery. Purposeful compression, like the whispered ritual, enhances rhythm under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion, though slight figurative stacking in peak beats (e.g., "swirling nebulae") prevents a higher score. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of dystopian exile with mystical artistry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like the tide dancer are irreplaceable.</comment>
