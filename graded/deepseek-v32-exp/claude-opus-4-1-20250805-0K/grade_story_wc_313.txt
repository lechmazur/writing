<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation shifts credibly from methodical duty to personal quest, driven by discovered artifacts and crystallized memories. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the photograph trembling in his hands. The final renunciation of his official role for witness-bearing is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses could be more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "knowing that some things, once submerged, demanded witness." Accumulative lens holds, with details compounding to reconfigure meaning. Structure is single POV with smooth transitions, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the reservoir's "ancient teeth" to the pharmacy's "black mirrors," constraining Marcus's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the ridgeway and wind chime enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from documentation to uncovering truth, driven by Marcus's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his commitment to witness, foreclosing the official narrative. One meaningful tightening occurs when the photograph triggers his investigative turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and witness emerges organically through images like the tonic bottle and photographs, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "spinning the fragments into shared meaning," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflecting Marcus's professional and personal perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., memory triggers) is taught and paid off. No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with varied rhythm and high information density. No artifacts like loops or mixed metaphors; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of a resurfacing drowned town is fresh and transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet reflection heightening stakes. No derivative echoes; originality arises from particulars.</comment>
