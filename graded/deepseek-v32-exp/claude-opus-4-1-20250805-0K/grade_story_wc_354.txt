<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viktor's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits and internal conflict, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation to stay is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing return to the Academy. Mira applies secondary pressure, and the worry stone use reinforces hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Viktor's decision to stay, reconfiguring exile as gift. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of magnetic and thematic correlations tightening stakes. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; covenant's end drives structure. Persistent constraint of exile shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., magnetite chessboard altering play) and charging the final image with aurora correlation. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating action and theme. Micro-setting (worry stone) functions as object-as-setting, deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Viktor's choice) escalates under accumulative lens through deepening understanding in chess game and dialogue with Mira. Agency in decision to stay forecloses path with cost, driven by protagonist's alteration. Pressure coheres and tightens via pattern breaks and cadence shifts, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., chess as language for universe's games), with subtext in silence and gesture. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Viktor's realization. Complexity embraced with plausible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and character-specific, with dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., magnetic correlations) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated without muddle in peak beats. Minor register consistency in elevated diction, but clarity maintained; closure image undimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess mastery, magnetic nexus, and exile feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in blending elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates; closure reconfigures familiar material freshly.</comment>
