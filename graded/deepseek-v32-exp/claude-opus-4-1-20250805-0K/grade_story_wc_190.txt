<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure driving the passenger's transformation. His motivation to catalyze change is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final earned change in the passenger is credible and rooted in prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the passenger's smile and non-flinching at the train whistle) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting silence with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the storm glass vial's equilibrium signaling completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail selective and purposeful. Settings like the Opal Arch and Mirror Gallery are integrated into action, reflecting internal states and shaping tactics through acoustic properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with noise monitoring and terrace navigation tightening the stake in the passenger's inner peace. Cost is legible in her gradual relaxation, though the escalation is more gradual than sharply causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the transformed train whistle, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on silence as presence. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, without moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in Marcus's observations and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal, and elision (e.g., terrace effects) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, such as in the climax where the vaulting hush is rendered with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of sound-reshaping terraces offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific detail and emotional truth. Risk-taking in setting and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
