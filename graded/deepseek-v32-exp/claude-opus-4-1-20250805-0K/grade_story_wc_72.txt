<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thessaly's internal conflict between guilt and necessity is embodied in her telepathic communications, and Marina's shift from academic certainty to nuanced acceptance is earned through cascading revelations. Micro-choices under pressure, such as Marina nearly dropping the ampoule, reveal character hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of black-and-white judgment feels inevitable based on prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Thessaly's "structural weakness" shifting, reweighting her eternal vigil. Causal lens holds tightly from ampoule discovery to memory revelations. Orientation is immediate, with drowned garden and diving bell anchored in first paragraph. Persistent constraint of paralysis shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choices by housing the ampoule and serving as the site of revelation, charging the final image of "monument to complexity." Sensory details like "kelp forests thread through marble archways" are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (ampoule) evolves meaning from poison to symbol of nuanced history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency in requesting memories and deciding to share the truth, under causal pressure. Dominant stake of truth vs. reputation tightens with each revelation, costing Marina's life's work. The "purple poison" moment forces a trade-off between live options, with cost legible in her trembling hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of moral complexity emerges through particulars like the foxglove toxin and drowned city, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Thessaly's freedom from "absolute judgment." Marina's "purple" metaphor slightly echoes theme but is integrated into character voice and not in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marina with clean telepathic access to Thessaly. Voice has distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "cascading like dominoes falling upward." Mental dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping; elision of memory sequences is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "ready to share the complete story with whoever would listen, welcoming every shade of gray." No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "tentacles" is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentence propulsion varies with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathic statue and archaeological mystery feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost city, living statue) are transformed through specific moral calculus and nuanced closure. Risk-taking in mental communication heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
