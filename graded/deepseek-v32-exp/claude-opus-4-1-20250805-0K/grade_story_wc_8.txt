<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Marcus's internal conflict is legible, though his turnaround feels slightly rapid, but is earned by prior relationship. The final choice to transmit the truth has visible cost in Marcus's defection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with because/therefore linkages; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marcus leaves his insignia, with felt cost on the page. Orientation is clear early, and the lens remains consistent without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the station and rosebush constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. peace escalates through Elara's agency, narrowing options with the transmission decision. Cost is legible in Marcus's departure and the illuminated letter's symbolic glow, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus noble lies emerges through events and images, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reinforced by the rosebush and station motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and no major artifacts. Minor issues include slight telling in "emotional rationality," but figurative language is controlled and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing historical fabrication with character-driven stakes. Risk-taking in concept heightens coherence, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
