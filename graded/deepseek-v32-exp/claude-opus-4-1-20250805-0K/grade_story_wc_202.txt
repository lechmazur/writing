<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her gift and grandmother's teachings, with embodied emotion in moments like trembling fingers. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as accepting the palette knife, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira gains the map and plans to project stories, with cost legible in her responsibility. Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident to resolution. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure is tight with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "rope bridges swayed" and "bubbling vials" enhancing atmosphere. The alchemist's market and lighthouse foundation constrain choices and charge the final image. However, the environment doesn't heavily pressure tactics beyond the initial discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled as honoring overlooked histories, escalating through Mira's agency in uncovering the painting. A meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to use the fragment, with cost in the responsibility assumed. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres, but the escalation lacks a high-stakes trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of translation and hidden histories emerges through concrete events and images, like the painting's layers and fragment's refractions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, subtext relies heavily on implied meaning rather than deep ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "read the spaces between languages." Voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue with Valdric is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied sentence structures and purposeful figurative language. Information density is high, advancing story and character. Minor overwriting in phrases like "elusively tangible sense" slightly muddles peak beats, but no major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes translation, art, and history in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like "pentimento shadows" and "constellation that appeared only in paintings." Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
