<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her acceptance of her role is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her impending death charges the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with because/therefore linkages from diagnosis to discovery. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where her tumor bridges species, reweighting the premise with felt cost. The persistent constraint of her condition shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The temple orchard and living stone pillars constrain choices and charge the final image, as the copper network and pillars directly shape the climax. Economy and specificity avoid generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interspecies communication escalates through Mira's agency, driven by the threat of remodeling. Cost is legible in her acceptance of death as an appointment, narrowing options and foreclosing paths. Pressure coheres under the causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect and death as translation emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfigured purpose of the caretaker role. Subtext operates in the wiring and diary without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Mira's urgency and calm. Voice modulates under pressure, and any elision (e.g., diary contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and literary elements with freshness, transforming tropes through specific details like electromagnetic translation. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
