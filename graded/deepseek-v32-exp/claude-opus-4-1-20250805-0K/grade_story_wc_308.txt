<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yula's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices like pressing the arrowhead revealing her hierarchy of values. Her transition from movement to stillness is earned through centuries of practice, with credible endurance and a felt cost in time spent. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the return of her younger voice and her weathered resolve. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns and echoes. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with stillness drawing the pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the bone towers and canyon constraining choices through echoes and resonance. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as dust on shoulders and vultures' patterns. The arrowhead functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Yula's agency under the accumulative lens, with the wandering pulse and bird patterns tightening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in centuries of stillness and the synchronization moment. Dominant stake (mastering navigation through stillness) is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the arrowhead and echoes, offering a non-literal answer to navigation through stillness. Subtext operates in implication, like the birds' patterns encoding messages. No moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters through Yula's focus on echoes and patterns. Rhythmic control is evident under pressure, such as in the description of vultures' spirals. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "calcified remains of creatures that had sung themselves to death." Read-aloud rhythm is natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of stillness as navigation through time, with specific details like bone towers and arrowhead carving. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes (e.g., stone skimmer) feels inevitable.</comment>
