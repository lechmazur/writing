<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is strong with clear motives rooted in her role as a curator; her micro-choices under pressure, like waiting and inviting stories, reveal a hierarchy of values. Elena's emotional progression feels earned, though secondary characters like Jorge and Mrs. Chen apply immediate pressure without deep individuation. The final choice to follow the locket is motivated, but Elena's transformation relies slightly on off-stage recounting, costing a hairline deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from locket discovery to community action; closure is a decisive change as Elena plans to write back, with cost legible in her tears. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of the locked mailbox shapes tactics. No plot amnesia or convenience; the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the courtyard acting as a micro-setting that constrains choices by gathering the community. Sensory details like "dawn painted the courtyard walls amber" are filtered through Marta's POV. However, the shelter description is less charged, and spatial choreography remains clear but not deeply tactile in all beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency under the causal lens, from curiosity to leading the search, with cost visible in Elena's emotional release. The dominant stake of connection tightens through the discovery of letters, foreclosing isolation. Community collaboration adds pressure without coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing broken connections emerges through particulars like the locket and mailbox, not statement; subtext operates in gestures like Marta's tilted head. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elena's "This home," reweighting prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV from Marta is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, e.g., "sandstorm calm." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with Jorge's revelation. No head-hopping or register drift; elision in Elena's backstory is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "tears fell like rain after drought" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence openings vary, and momentum is maintained through concise beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing the locket mystery with community activism, feeling organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the mailbox as shrine. Risk-taking in multi-character resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the core premise has familiar roots.</comment>
