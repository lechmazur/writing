<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (her missing brother), with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. Interiority is concrete, such as "frostbitten hope" blooming into certainty, and the final decision to join the transformation is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Marina chooses to join the metamorphosis, foreclosing her old life with felt cost (arrowhead dissolving, her smile). Causal lens holds tightly from arrowhead to messages to revelation. Orientation is clear within first paragraph, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the underground garden with gravity anomalies constrains choices (e.g., "gravity pockets pull at bones") and charges the final image with bioluminescent life. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (completing metamorphosis) escalates through Marina's agency under causal lens, from investigation to acceptance. Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of her role and embrace of transformation. One meaningful tightening narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and turning grief into transcendence emerges organically from events and images, like the arrowhead and static messages. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "cosmic joke" without moralizing. Subtext operates in dialogue and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure ("frostbitten hope," "cosmic joke"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext in static messages. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story efficiently. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized: Thunderbird as a force for metamorphosis, gravity anomalies, and grief-fed transformation. Tropes are transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
