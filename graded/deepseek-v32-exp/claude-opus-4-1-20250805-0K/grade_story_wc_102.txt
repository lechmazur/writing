<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mae's motivation is clear and rooted in past life memory, driving her quest with embodied emotion. Her final choice to release the photographs is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost. However, some interiority edges toward abstraction in peak beats, slightly reducing concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Mae's offering of photographs, reconfiguring her purpose under a causal lens. The cost is legible in her emptied state and the ghost's fade. Orientation is clear early, and events link logically from memory to action without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct setting constrains choice by guiding Mae to a specific arch, and the camera obscura functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mae's agency under the causal lens, from using the tear to releasing her photographs, with cost legible in her sacrifice. The dominant stake of finding unused love tightens meaningfully, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the door of starlight and the repository of love, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the ghost's whispered revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Mae's perceptual signature, with poetic diction and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. Voice remains distinct and coherent, even in mystical elements, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "ribbons of light like silk scarves") slightly reduces precision in peak beats, but propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a pilgrim of sparks and unused love storage feels fresh and inevitable, synthesizing mystical elements with character-specific stakes. Risk-taking in the lyrical, spiritual premise heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
