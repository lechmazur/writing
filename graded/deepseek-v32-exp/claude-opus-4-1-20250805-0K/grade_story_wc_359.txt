<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrian's motivation is clear and rooted in her synesthetic gift, driving the plot with consistent agency. Her interiority is concrete through sensory details, though lacks deep internal conflict. The final choice to unfetter the symphony is earned by prior causality, with cost implied in the risk to the bells.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with clear orientation and closure via a decisive change—the world remembers wonder. The amber music sheet setup pays off, and cost is legible in the Council's defeated decree. No causality breaks; structure is tight for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern setting is vividly specific, constraining choices as Lyrian uses it to conduct the symphony. Sensory details (e.g., "tasted of winter mint") are purposeful and POV-filtered. Environment charges the final image and shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (wonder vs. rationalism) escalate through Lyrian's agency in striking the ice, unleashing the aurora. Under causal lens, this tightening forecloses the Council's threat with visible cost—the demolition order crumbles. Protagonist-driven escalation is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's necessity emerges through events and imagery, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the aurora's eternal dance. Subtext in "certify wonder as essential" is dramatized, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic descriptions. Voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., amber sheet's notation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense with figurative language but purposeful and legible, advancing story momentum. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "waves of turquoise sound") doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes synesthesia, music, and aurora in a fresh, inevitable way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the amber sheet. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
