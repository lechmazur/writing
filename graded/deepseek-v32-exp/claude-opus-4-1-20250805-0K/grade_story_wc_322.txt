<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "fever burning behind her eyes"). Final choice to leave the altered gallery is earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual cost as the gallery is "forever altered"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern buildup; sinew thread as persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., gallery transforms through weaving) and charging the final image; sensory details like "walls breathe" are selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's weaving under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformed gallery; stakes deepen through pattern eruptions, and agency forecloses paths with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., sinew thread as connection); ending offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final labyrinth image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "rational enchantment" lens); voice is consistent and poetic, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no significant loops or artifacts that harm clarity. Minor density in figurative language but maintains propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original concept with specific synthesis of fever dreams and architecture; risk-taking in abstract theme pays off with heightened stakes and coherence, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
