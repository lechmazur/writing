<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her actions with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the monarch carries the knowledge and structures dissolve, with cost legible in the fleeting nature. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The verdant grotto constrains choice through its moisture dissolving structures, charging the final image with impermanence. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Mira's POV, and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in building temporary structures, under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the dissolution. The dominant stake of honoring histories tightens through the monarch's arrival, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and overlooked histories emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the dissolving structures. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and read-aloud rhythm is natural, with no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of temporary structures and moth wings carrying histories is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
