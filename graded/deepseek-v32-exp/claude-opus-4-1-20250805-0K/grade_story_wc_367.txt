<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The pause at the mirror-twin ship shows internal conflict, and her final understanding earns the change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation is causally earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost in the lighthouse's new configuration and the dawn's reshaping. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraints of laughter and wick shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of stars rearranging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the Emerald Lighthouse and glass lantern wick constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, integrating into action. The environment pressures navigation and supports the theme through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the three ships and the mirror-twin encounter. Cost is legible in the convergence of realities and the wick's reconfiguration. Protagonist's choices narrow options and deepen knowledge, foreclosing paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring navigation between realities without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of Mira's purpose. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the mirror-twin harmony, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's role. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. Voice remains coherent through emotional peaks, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold obscuring causality.

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes fresh elements like laughing herald and dimensional navigation, transforming tropes through specific choices.
