<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation to compile fragments into meaning is clear and consistently drives her actions; her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final valve turn embodies a credible endurance with felt cost, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration via the mechanical sigh, charging absence and presence with conceptual cost under the accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure with shards like work intervals coheres to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like rain-washed windows and salt crystals filtering through Kessa's POV; the herald's valve as a micro-setting object constrains choices and charges the final image, integral to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of compiling meaning escalate through Kessa's agency in arranging fragments and community contributions, under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the final image where absence is reweighted, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of navigated absences emerges organically through fragments and gaps, not direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the valve sigh, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a lyrical, archivist perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction control under pressure, and any elision in pattern is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion and no muddle in peak beats like the final valve turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of navigated absences is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure and thematic depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, supported by specific particulars.</comment>
