<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in backstory, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., selecting seeds based on bird calls). Interiority is concrete and embodied, though internal conflict is minimal, fitting the accumulative lens. Final renunciation is earned, but lacks deep contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of seeds splitting and roots reaching. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of reclamation pays off. Persistent constraint of dead languages shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the jetty and reef constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "rattled like old bones") are filtered through POV, and environmental details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming the battlefield escalates through the coachman's agency in planting seeds, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual and felt in the promise of forgetting war, but escalation is gradual without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nature consuming war emerges organically through particulars like seed pods and dead languages, with subtext in imagery. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the garden's growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong (e.g., reading gull calls), and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting risks exist (e.g., "viciously fertile"). Closure image remains clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is original and synthesized uniquely, with risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design. Tropes of reclamation are transformed through specific details like dead languages and bird calls. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable and heightens stakes.</comment>
