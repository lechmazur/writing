<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with micro-choices like navigating upward revealing her values. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep embodied conflict. The arrow tip's temporary effects show struggle but not profound flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Kessa inserting the arrow tip, triggering light and knowledge, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the reconfiguration of understanding, though the emotional price is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with floating arches and whirling silence constraining choices like navigation and inversion survival. The environment charges the final image through the monument and water flows, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are well-signaled, and escalation is driven by Kessa's agency under the causal lens, from time pressure to discovery. Cost is legible in the temporary plant collapse and the gained knowledge, though the peak choice lacks intense trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through adaptation emerges organically from water flows and tree behavior, with subtext in echoes and arrow tips. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction like "whirling silence" and perceptual signature tied to Kessa's role. No dialogue, but elision is purposeful, and rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats like the inversion scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with upward rivers and gravity inversions, transforming quest tropes through specific world-building. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in setting heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
