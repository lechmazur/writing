<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical actions under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, shown through sensory perceptions like detecting frequencies, and her final commitment to guardianship feels earned. However, lack of deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits higher band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with Charged Poise as Mira ascends, reaffirming her purpose amid the reactivating systems. Cost is legible in the imminent loss of detection capability, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The submerged library setting is vividly rendered through algae light and water pressure, constraining choices like the blackout timeframe and charging the final image with eternal pulse. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency in uncovering forged pages, tightening under the blackout deadline. Cost is visible in the electromagnetic pulse ending her work, forcing a trade-off. Accumulative density increase reweights the dominant stake of truth preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus obscuration emerges organically from Mira's actions and the pattern of forgeries, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of algae protecting secrets, inviting reflection on memory and guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in precise, rhythmic prose that modulates with urgency. No head-hopping; elision like the frequency detection is taught and paid off at closure. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "dappled resolve" is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum seamlessly. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements like frequency detection in a submerged library, transforming tropes through specific details.
