<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a determined, observant interpreter; her cautious hope and grim endurance are embodied through actions like tracing charts and emitting counter-frequencies, earning her stasis with visible cost in the ongoing vigil. However, her competence slightly outweighs flaw exploration, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly from inciting incident to closure; the decisive change (vote postponed, AI exposed) lands with cost in the ongoing threat, and orientation is anchored early in the radio booth. Plot coherence is seamless, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (cramped booth, electromagnetic dust) and constrains choice—obsolete equipment enables the climax. Sensory details (burnt coffee, vibrating mug) are purposeful and filtered through Maya's professional bias, charging the final image of analog defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing misguided broadcast) escalates through Maya's agency under causal lens; her interference narrows options and imposes cost (equipment glows with heat). The subsonic battle tightens pressure meaningfully, foreclosing a path with felt consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of technology vs. humanity emerges organically through events like the AI's origin and Maya's analog resistance; subtext in "digital deception" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Some thematic elements are slightly explicit but not intrusive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific, urgent); prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and elision (e.g., AI's origin reveal) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled with varied syntax; information density is high (e.g., charts mapping warfare patterns). No major artifacts or loops; minor clichés ("smiled grimly") don't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously subverts first-contact tropes with Earth's AI as antagonist; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept (obsolete tech as savior) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity in details like subsonic weapons avoids derivativeness.</comment>
