<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with her olfactory sensitivity guiding actions and her ambition transforming into patience through micro-choices. The final endurance—breathing deeply despite the stench—is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her serene acceptance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her initial stomach-turning reaction versus her dedicated care.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Mira sways "rooted at last," reconfiguring her understanding of wisdom. The accumulative lens holds, building through sketched patterns and sensory details. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the village's motion shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village constrains choice by necessitating serenity within motion, and the suspended garden charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like mist rising "like steam from a witch's cauldron," integrating environment into action. The corpse flower's soil and dew collection specifics alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, from rushed lessons to meditative sketching, tightening her understanding. Cost is unmistakable when she embraces the flower's "overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible" stench, foreclosing her earlier impatience. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge through embodied realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom as undercurrent emerges through particulars like sketching mirroring the village's sway, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the flower as "patient teacher," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Master Thorne's studied observations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by olfactory sensitivity and rhythmic control in phrases like "putrid-sweet promise." Elision is taught early through generational sketches and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "wisdom flows beneath action like sap beneath bark" is purposeful and clear. Propulsion accelerates with the flower's growth, avoiding muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes corpse flower lore, treetop cultivation, and familial sketching into a non-obvious whole that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in olfactory-centric narration heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, as in the re pricing of stench as communication.</comment>
