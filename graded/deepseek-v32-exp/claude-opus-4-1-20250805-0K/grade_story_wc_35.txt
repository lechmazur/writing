<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miran's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift, with interiority that is concrete and character-particular. Her final choice to subsume the remorse is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she carries the digested grief. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her initial goal to smooth memories versus the awakening deeper purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with Miran's transformation of remorse into acceptance carrying felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by sensory details and memory integration. Orientation is clear early, and the plot coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and essential, with the desert fortress, tidal pools, and coral pavilion constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Miran's POV, and the environment directly shapes the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict over memories escalates under the accumulative lens, driven by Miran's agency in subsuming the remorse. Cost is legible on-page when she experiences the emotional contagion and carries the burden, foreclosing other paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory, regret, and transformation emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the feast of acceptance, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the coral pavilion's waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and first-person through Miran, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose that reflects her chef's sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time passing) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language that enhances clarity without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere purposefully. Line-level craft supports propulsion, especially in peak beats like the subsumption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, stored remorse, and desert setting with originality and inevitability. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and emotional concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the coral pavilion and tidal pool analysis feel fresh and integral.</comment>
