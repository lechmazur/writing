<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt and protection, driving her to eavesdrop and make corrections. Internal conflict is embodied in her hesitation and eventual confession. The final choice to be honest is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the relief and thawing mistrust. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are concrete and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as they reconcile and hold hands, under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words: Mira as night registrar, Samuel under canopy, after closing. The lens holds without ambiguity; confessions drive the resolution. Cost is legible in "relief that flooded through her felt like spring rain" and the thawing mistrust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "puddles a mirror" and "crystalline walls reflecting whispers," influencing choices through acoustics. The forecourt acts as a micro-setting that pressures their interaction and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's POV; details are integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is their relationship and truth about the audit; escalation is driven by agency as Mira confesses eavesdropping and Samuel reveals Marcus's confession. This tightens options and leads to resolution with cost legible in their relief and renewed trust. One meaningful tightening is sufficient under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and transparency emerges through events and images like the lens and doodles, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "clarity and distortion were sometimes the same gift." Earned through specific confessions and struggles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited from Mira; voice is distinct and lyrical with perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the confessional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "trapped moonlight" is purposeful and coherent. No register drift or template cadence; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Clear propulsion in key beats, e.g., the confession sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis of elements like the whispering forecourt and projector lens, transforming themes of trust. Emotional truth is specific and non-generic; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, though slightly familiar in core premise.</comment>
