<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is clear and rooted in exile, with interiority shown through embodied perception (e.g., "words had become foreign things"). His transformation is earned by prior causality, but slight passivity in early beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as Aldric becomes guardian of possibility, cost legible in "armor dissolving" and "splinters of potential." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern taught by orchard and marionettes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., trees' languages guide action) and charges the final image with "cracks of light." Sensory detail is vivid and selective, such as "air tasted of copper and snow-melt," filtered through Aldric's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in ritual performance, with cost legible in Aldric's transformation. Agency in oath-taking forecloses his prior path, though stakes are more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibility emerges through particulars like the marionettes' awakening and Aldric's transformation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "crown of thorns and roses."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "trees pulsed with factually mystical energy"). Poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., past events) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "shivering bliss") slightly limits score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, puppetry, and quantum concepts feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details like "liquid starlight" anchor freshness, and transformation is earned.</comment>
