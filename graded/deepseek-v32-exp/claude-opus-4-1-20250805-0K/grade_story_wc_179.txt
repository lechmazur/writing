<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brother Marcus exhibits contradictory impulses (fractured faith vs. scheming mind) that drive the climax; his motivation to teach resentment release is embodied in micro-choices like guiding the Magistrate's touch, earning the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (Magistrate weeps, son's fever breaks) under a causal lens; cellular memory as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary constrains choices (communication through touch) and charges the final image; sensory details like "feeling the ghost of its lost melody" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from Vera's warning to the Magistrate's transformation; cost is legible in the Magistrate's loosening grip and weeping, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resentment release emerges through particulars like the broken music box's reprise; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, rooted in cellular memory's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Marcus, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction; touch-based "dialogue" carries subtext, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "reality bent like water" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of soundless sanctuary, cellular memory, and scheming pacifist feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
