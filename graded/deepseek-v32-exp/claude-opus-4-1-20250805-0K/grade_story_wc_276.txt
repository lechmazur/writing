<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kova's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotions (e.g., "heart hammered rhythms") and micro-choices under pressure (voicing silence). The final choice to hold the echo is earned by seven years of preparation, with cost legible in her changed state. Contradictory impulses act in scene during the echo's test, transliterating determination, longing, and fear simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost: Kova integrates the echo, "ready to be cast forward into the world's wounds." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, driven by pattern breaks and density increase. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the rail spike as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the sound wave garden constraining choices (Kova moves "carefully, her bare feet finding the spaces between feelings") and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as constellations casting "shadows that sang." The rail spike functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kova's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from voicing silence to the echo's testing, with cost unmistakable in the transliteration of her emotions and the burning rail spike. The dominant stake (catching the echo) tightens through her actions, foreclosing other paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as "some songs never die, they just learn to swim in different seas," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and the echo's whisper, deepening through particulars like the goddess's gift and Kova's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("constellations above moved in their sleep") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., voicing silence) is taught and pays off at closure. Diction remains within Kova's lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds that harm clarity. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "vertical rivers" of sound), though minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "phosphorescent rain") doesn't obscure causality. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the conflict.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of concepts (sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
