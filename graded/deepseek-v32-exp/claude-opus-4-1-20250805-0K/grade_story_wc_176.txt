<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elsa's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from guilt to purpose is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Elsa's realization and the physical transformation. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with coherent causality from the punched card to the rope reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the icebound sanctum and aurora constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are integrated into action and reflect POV bias, such as the "ice walls sweating in the arriving sunlight." Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten names escalates through Elsa's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional journey and the physical process. One meaningful tightening occurs as she reconfigures the rope, foreclosing paths and altering knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and preservation emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bronze bells and rope, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; prose reflects Elsa's mindset and profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no register drift or artifacts in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of elements like lost wax casting and sound-preserving rope, transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in conceptual blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight and resists template plots.</comment>
