<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a fault-tolerant oracle, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final act of smudging the signature is earned by prior causality, foreclosing recognition with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as holding multiple truths, and the resolution avoids diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's solitude and hidden knowledge. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and thematic resonance. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of margins shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station pressures choices and supplies resources, while the botanical illustrations charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV. The environment constrains choice, as seen in her use of the station's logs and tools to uncover truths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her investigation deepens the stake of finding truth. Cost is legible in her isolation and the electromagnetic sorrow of the aurora. A meaningful tightening occurs when she witnesses the flowers blooming, narrowing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the smudged signatures and fault-tolerant flowers, offering a resonant non-literal answer about truth in margins. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's poetic yet precise voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with lyrical but purposeful figurative language. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; syntax varies naturally to support rhythm. Closure image is undulled by artifacts, and sentence-level craft advances story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of oracle, botanical illustrations, and auroral flowers, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded details and character choice, avoiding template plots.</comment>
