<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's frugality and devotion are consistently embodied through concrete actions like saving coins for her work, and her final choice to activate the beacon is earned by prior causality. Internal conflict is shown through her sacrifice versus societal plunder, with emotions filtered through tactile details like trembling fingers. However, some interiority edges toward summary in peak beats, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—contact with cosmic intelligence—under a causal lens, driven by Mara's aligned actions and the tile's discovery. Cost is legible in her years of devotion, and orientation is anchored early with the palace descent. The structure tightens meaningfully through planetary alignment and tile activation, fulfilling the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Babylonian palace setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like starlight gaps and phosphorescent minerals woven into action. Spatial choreography is clear in chambers and tile placement, and the environment functions as a key tool in the encryption system. Micro-setting elements like the magic square tile directly shape Mara's tactics and the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from deciphering blueprints to aligning charts, forcing a trade-off between devotion and societal norms. The stake in understanding the encryption tightens through the tile's warming and the resonance in the walls, with cost legible in her frugal years. The climax reweights options through contact, foreclosing her prior isolation with felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from Mara's journey, where devotion to mathematical truth bridges cosmic distances, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shifting cuneiform and the covenant's silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to communication. The final image of starlight sealing the covenant reweights prior material through conceptual repricing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in her astronomical focus and lyrical rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though some phrases like "dusky harmony" edge toward decorative abstraction. Elision in time encryption is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing plot and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "frequency below hearing but felt in bone" is purposeful and clear, and syntax varies to support escalation. No scaffolding or redundancy obscures the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes ancient astronomy and alien communication with specificity, transforming tropes through Mara's grounded devotion. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing at closure heightens stakes, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflections like the encryption system and tile as key avoid derivative patterns.</comment>
