<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and rooted in failure, with embodied emotion (trembling fingers) and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between old and new ways drives the narrative, and the final choice to weave worlds is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of sealing with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws compound into revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the seed of light and transformed role), under a hybrid drive lens that holds causally. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and structure is a single scene with coherent causality from failure to discovery. The flute's true purpose as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (canyon hush, shimmering air) filtered through Kessa's POV. The Thunder-echo range and flute constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, and atmosphere deepens with the silence becoming a benediction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. sealing) is signaled early and escalates through Kessa's agency in playing the new song, weaving worlds under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the gained insight and foreclosed old path, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options. No coincidence; resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events: failure leading to transformation through weaving, not moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (figure's signal) and the final image of the seed, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned insights arise from concrete struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (Kessa's biased notice of silence and thin reality). Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Minimal dialogue carries subtext; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with clear propulsion in peak beats. Syntax supports emphasis, and diction remains within POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of relic keeper tropes through specific choices (weaving vs. sealing). Emotional truth in failure and redemption feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation is organic.</comment>
