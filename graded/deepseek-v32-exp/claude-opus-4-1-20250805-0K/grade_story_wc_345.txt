<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot, but her ghostly nature limits interior contradiction and embodied emotion, reducing depth. Her micro-choices (writing messages) reveal values, but the lack of internal conflict under pressure keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from ghost's interventions to community action. Closure is a decisive change (ghost fades after salvation) with felt cost (her dissolution) and resonant reconfiguration (bell as symbol). Orientation is immediate, and no plot breaks harm causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific (floating arches, crimson sky, orchards) with sensory detail filtered through Marina's POV. The environment pressures choices by enabling the fungal network solution, and the bell charges the final image, but it doesn't deeply constrain tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival) escalates under causal lens via ghost's agency, leading to a meaningful tightening (community collaboration). Cost is legible in ghost's fading and the collective effort, foreclosing isolation with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unity vs. suspicion emerges organically from events and images (messages, bell), with subtext in gestures like shared soil samples. The final message ("Remember") is slightly explicit but avoids moralizing, offering a resonant answer through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and consistent, with a poetic, distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story efficiently, and figurative language ("brambled hope") is purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and ecological crisis feels fresh, with specific setting and character choices transforming tropes. Risk-taking in using a ghost as catalyst heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
