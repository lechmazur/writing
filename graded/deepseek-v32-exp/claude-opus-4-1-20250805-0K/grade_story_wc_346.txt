<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a doomsday clock adjuster is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion shown through his interaction with the puppet head. His transformation is earned by prior causality, but minor abstraction in interiority prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the lighthouse beam ignites and the clock moves backward, charging the final image with cost. The orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse and puppet head constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through POV. Setting is integrated into action, altering tactics and supporting theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from micro-adjustments to singing the lullaby, with cost legible in the transformation. The stake in humanity's end tightens meaningfully, though the shift is more conceptual than physical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery and motif without direct statement, offering a non-literal answer to trauma and hope via the lullaby and broken beauty. Subtext is rich in the final image, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and lyrical prose controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping, but slight overwriting in figurative language prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving the pattern and closure. Minor template cadence in descriptive passages slightly reduces momentum, but no major artifacts obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of doomsday clock adjuster, lighthouse, and puppet head feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specificity anchors universals without derivative echoes.</comment>
