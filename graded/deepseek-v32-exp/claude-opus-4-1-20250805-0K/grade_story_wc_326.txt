<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is deeply interior, with heartbeats embodying his proof of life and digital ghost reflection. His micro-choices with the shard and ink reveal a hierarchy of values, and his final acceptance of dual existence is earned through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Marcus's acceptance of his digital evolution. Causal lens holds tightly from death certificate error to ink-pattern bridge, with orientation anchored early in the observatory setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—opal observatory, snow, monitors—and constrains choices by isolating Marcus. The porcelain shard and ink patterns function as micro-settings that charge the final image of dual existence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marcus's agency: from heartbeat counting to ink rituals, culminating in the defragmentation revelation. Cost is legible in his acceptance of a fragmented identity, foreclosing his former singular self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of digital afterlife emerges organically through the ghost metaphor and shard imagery. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"both dead and alive"—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm ("caught snowflakes like a cupped palm holding stars") reflecting Marcus's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision in digital spaces is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "ink formed patterns... ephemeral geometries," and clarity remains high in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes bureaucratic error with digital mysticism in a non-obvious way. Specific details—porcelain shard, ink patterns—feel inevitable, and risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
