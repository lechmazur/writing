<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to translate silence is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., clicking the empty camera). Internal conflict between past glory and present silence is dramatized, and the final renunciation of sound for visual symphony is earned with visible cost. Chen's presence as advisor crucially shapes turns, and their relationship forces choices that alter the story's state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence becomes a beginning, cost legible in Maya's smile and the echo of gestures. Orientation is anchored early (<120 words), and the mosaic of shards (harbor, notebook, gestures) coheres without causality breaks. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor constrains choices as their concert hall, charging the final image with moonlight and memory. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "spilled mercury" glow), filtered through Maya's POV. The camera functions as micro-setting, evolving in use and meaning to shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) escalates under accumulative lens through Maya's agency with Chen, culminating in a silent symphony that forecloses the path of auditory music with felt cost. Pressure tightens via density increase in mapping and gestures, and the final choice to embrace visual art carries visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence and memory emerges organically from particulars like the camera and sign language, with subtext in gestures and imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "visual symphony," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces joyful sorrow without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Maya) is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "framing silence through its viewfinder"). Prose rhythm and diction reflect her composer's mind, and signing as dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., empty camera) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("harbor glowed like spilled mercury") is coherent and voice-motivated. No overwriting or register drift; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sign language, silence, and visual art feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure that heightens stakes. Specific details (e.g., Leica camera, arthritic joints) avoid tropes, and the core premise is transformed through grounded character choices. Closure reconfigures familiarity with ingenuity.</comment>
