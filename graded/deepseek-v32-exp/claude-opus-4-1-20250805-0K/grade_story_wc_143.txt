<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in purposeful curiosity; her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., preparing the chemical timer) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. No significant weaknesses; closure choice is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with felt cost in the final image of abandonment; the accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by descriptive density and emotional resonance. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of time (evacuation) shapes tactics. No causality breaks; structure is cohesive for the scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory detail filtered through Vera's POV, with the lunar environment and objects like the hourglass constraining choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are economical and purposeful. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (documenting the last ice wisp) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through Vera's agency, with cost legible in her vigil and departure. Pressure tightens meaningfully with the impending evacuation, foreclosing options. No coincidental resolution; escalation is driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., hourglass grain, chemical reaction) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of curiosity and retreat. Subtext operates in implication, and emotional aftereffect is earned through particulars. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, melancholic tone that reflects Vera's perception; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative, with high information density and varied syntax; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure image is sharp. Read-aloud rhythm is natural, and technical craft is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of lunar retreat with specific, grounded details (e.g., chemical messaging, hourglass grain); tropes are transformed through character depth, and risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
