<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling from recognition, not fear. Her slyly heartfelt approach, inherited from her grandmother, drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final renunciation of credit is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her hidden effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in Mara's "dappled resolve" and the forced collaboration, reweighting interdependence. The Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to plan, with orientation anchored early in the volcanic setting and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amphitheater and surveyor's chain constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "stone lungs" and thermal expansion filtered through Mara's POV. Setting pressures tactics, such as using the crumbling space for hidden calculations, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of water rights conflict escalates through Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from adhesive analysis to floodgate design that forces trade-offs. Cost is unmistakable in her trembling and the encrypted compassion, narrowing options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges through particulars like the mixed resin note and floodgate mechanics, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like carving plans secretly, deepening the central question of interdependence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose like "star-drunk night," and elision (e.g., the note's contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates under pressure with controlled diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with purposeful figurative language like "stone lungs," but minor overwriting in "elegant cruelty and kindness intertwined" slightly muddles peak beats. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of floodgate engineering and social conflict resolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking in hidden compassion heightening stakes. Specific details like the surveyor's chain and adhesive analysis transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
