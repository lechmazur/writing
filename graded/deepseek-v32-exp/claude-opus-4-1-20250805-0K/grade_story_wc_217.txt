<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to harmonize discord is clear and consistent, driving her actions such as helping the boy and reinterpreting the broken kite. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "warmly attentive eyes" and catching the feather. The final choice to find beauty in incompleteness is earned through the kite incident, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—the broken kite is revalued, and Mira's realization about dawn reweights prior material. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through images and patterns. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows naturally from the kite snap to the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt lagoon and objects like the feather and kite constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "rainwater still trickling from mangrove roots." The environment pressures Mira's actions and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and escalates through the kite snapping, a pattern break under the Accumulative lens. Mira's agency in helping the boy and reinterpreting the kite drives the deepening, with cost legible in the broken state transformed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the feather and kite, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "mending darkness." Subtext operates in implication, e.g., the drake's feather symbolizing second life. No moralizing; epiphanies are earned through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "symphonies in seaweed tangles." Dialogue is natural and brief, fitting characters. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "waves whispering their endless revisions." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors are consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the Accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of broken beauty through specific details like the drake's feather and kite transformation. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
