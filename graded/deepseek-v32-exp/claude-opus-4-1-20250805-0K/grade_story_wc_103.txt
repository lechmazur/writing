<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (e.g., feeling trapped by the past yet seeking freedom). Her final renunciation of the halo fragment is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in its disintegration, scaling to the story's length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the fragment's dissolution and the fading photographs. The lens holds without contradiction, and the halo fragment's persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with hyperbolic geometry enabling Elara to touch temporal flow. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as she actively steps onto bridges and navigates the maze, leading to a tightening where the disintegration forecloses options with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the fading photographs and dissolving fragment, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to time's texture without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the final image of time as a living thing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflected in poetic, reflective prose. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., time shifts) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "time's texture like sand") is voice-motivated and does not muddle clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes retrocognition, living architecture, and time as texture in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in non-linear elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure is fully integrated.</comment>
