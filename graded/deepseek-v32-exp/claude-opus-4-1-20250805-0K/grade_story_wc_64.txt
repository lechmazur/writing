<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and intensifies through her patient decoding, culminating in an earned decision to plant the tapestry with visible cost in her altered relationship to time. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal a consistent hierarchy of values, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Marta's realization of the "circular, seasonal" nature of intentions foreclosing her prior ritual with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the chess clock's stillness charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly charges the final image—the cemetery as a "garden of intentions"—with selective sensory detail filtered through Marta's POV. The cobalt silo and tools constrain her decoding actions, though the environment's pressure on choices is subtle rather than decisive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency in untangling the tapestry, deepening the stake of understanding grief under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in her renunciation of the clock ritual, narrowing options and reweighting devotion with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the tapestry's threads and gardening metaphors, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. The final image of planting the fragment reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates rhythm under pressure. Purposeful compression in decoding beats is taught and paid off, and elision (e.g., the tapestry's exact content) serves closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits zero loops or scaffold, high information density, and varied sentence rhythm that accelerates with revelation. Figurative language ("velveteen gloom") is consistent and legible, with no muddle in peak beats like the decoding sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes grief and devotion through a non-obvious lens of "uncharted echoes," with risk-taking in lyrical structure that heightens stakes. The tapestry decoding feels inevitable in hindsight, and specific details (e.g., chess clock) resist generic templates.</comment>
