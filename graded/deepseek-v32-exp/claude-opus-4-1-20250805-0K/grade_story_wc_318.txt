<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's mournful eagerness is embodied and drives his actions; his interiority is concrete, and his final choice to return monthly is earned by prior causality with visible cost (ongoing duty). No on-page relationships, but single-POV execution is strong with micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (Marcus's repetitive duty); inferred Hybrid lens holds, blending causal actions with textural buildup. Orientation is clear early, and the tunnel's role persists as a constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the echo chamber tunnel constrains choices (amplifying sound) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Hybrid lens, with cost legible (the family's laughter restored but requiring repeated efforts). Dominant stake (restoring joy) tightens through his mechanical symphony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief and joy echoing emerges through particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of leaf blowers as a "mechanical prayer."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and lyrical diction heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No dialogue, but voice control is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality is high with a non-obvious synthesis (leaf blowers as instruments for grief therapy); risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
