<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization as "both the lock and the key" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the inherited destiny. However, slight abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the message "Welcome home, granddaughter" reweights meaning with felt cost. The dance-driven causality is coherent, and the hangman's dice acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains choices (e.g., dancing in brackish water) and charges the final image (water spiral). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's POV, with vivid atmosphere enhancing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative lens, as her dance liberates data and narrows options. The cost is legible in the transformation of her identity and the laboratory's response, foreclosing paths with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the dance and dice, offering a non-literal answer to inheritance and transformation. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, with the final spiral recharging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., the dice's properties) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the dance sequence, though minor density in description prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of code-breaking through dance is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending mystical and scientific elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
