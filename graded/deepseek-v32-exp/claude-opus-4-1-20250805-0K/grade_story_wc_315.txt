<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict shown through her revision of the report. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, and emotions are embodied (e.g., parachute buckle habit). However, minor diagnostic label-speak in peak beats slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Maya embraces her purpose, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent corporate pressure shapes tactics. The final image reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Maya's POV. The nocturnal arbor constrains choices (e.g., climbing higher for patterns) and charges the final image, making it indispensable to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, with the radio conversation forcing a lie that narrows options. Cost is legible in the risk of ecosystem collapse and personal jeopardy, though it relies on a single key turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges naturally from events and images, with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Maya's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in poetic yet precise prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor rhythmic uniformity in high-pressure beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and serves the narrative, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of ecological and corporate themes, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in setting and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
