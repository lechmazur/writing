<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the medium's motivation intensifies credibly, and her final choice to send the apology is earned by prior causality with visible cost (shard crumbling). Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her past inability to speak versus present vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (shard disintegrates, healing begins) under a causal drive lens; orientation is immediate, and structure coheres with a single scene enriched by flashbacks that tilt present stakes. The gargoyle shard as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the mangrove labyrinth and spirits pressuring choices (wading, finding the heart) and mirroring internal states; the gargoyle shard as a micro-setting object constrains action and charges the closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (healing the relationship) escalate meaningfully under the causal lens through protagonist agency (raising the shard, touching the window); cost is legible in the shard's destruction and emotional exposure. One tightening—her decision to send the message—forecloses silence with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of apology and vulnerability emerges organically through images (unsent letters, condensation windows) and subtext without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material with a resonant, non-literal answer (message sent, healing begins) that embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative texture. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but no head-hopping or elision issues harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in climax (e.g., "condensation rose like morning mist"). Sentence-level propulsion advances story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (medium, gargoyle shard, unsent letters) feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
