<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation is clear and rooted in homesickness, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Final decision to leave is earned by prior causality, showing credible change from feral to softened state. Minor weakness: scholar's characterization is functional but slightly less nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (stepping into light) with felt cost (thawing garden, internal ice melting). Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (pendant) shapes tactics. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen garden setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (bare feet on frost) and charging the final image (thawing). Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, with spatial choreography coherent. Environment actively pressures protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return home vs. duty) escalates through protagonist agency (decision to help scholar and leave). Cost is legible in guardian's renunciation of feral nature. Pressure tightens meaningfully under causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty and homesickness emerge through events and images, not direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via conceptual repricing (making friends with uncertainty enables going home). Subtext in gestures like pendant transfer avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (feral, poetic voice). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Prose reflects guardian's degraded speech and mindset, with purposeful compression in high-pressure beats. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, but clarity maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of feral guardian in dimensional library is fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details (pendant, frozen garden). Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in voice heightens stakes. No derivative echoes or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
