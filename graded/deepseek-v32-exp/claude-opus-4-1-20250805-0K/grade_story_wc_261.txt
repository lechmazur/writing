<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority rendered through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., "reading the microscopic variations" in the coffee ring). Her final realization—that wounds are invitations—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her readiness to "begin again." Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her need to reopen scars against medical advice, demonstrating genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing: Maya's insight that miracles travel through "smaller doors" reweights the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored early ("quiet tower's medical bay, dawn light"). The frosted hourglass and scar-tunneling action create a taught pattern that pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Maya's POV (e.g., "amber stripes across her bandaged hands"). The tower, garden, and hourglass function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scars and the displaced miracle) escalates through Maya's agency-driven realizations, tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her acceptance of perpetual openness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scars "begin to speak," foreclosing the path of seeking closure and reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like coffee rings and plant telepathy, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of healing. Subtext operates through images and implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, as seen in "some wounds were meant to stay open, not as injury but as invitation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Diction remains within Maya's lexicon, and purposeful compression (e.g., "The plants knew this") supports the accumulative drive. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and legible. Minor overwriting in dense metaphor clusters (e.g., "vegetable grief") does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy with plants, scar-reading, and displaced miracles in a non-obvious, inevitable way. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals, as in the transformation of the miracle into "ambient, democratic" healings.</comment>
