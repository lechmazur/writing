<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like using the halo fragment. The earned change—forgetting her original self but gaining insight—has visible cost, though minor diagnostic speak in peak beats slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly, with closure as Conceptual Repricing: the realization that emotion is typography reweights the premise with cost (lost original self). Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through accumulating personalities and star vanishings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the topaz workshop and vanishing stars constraining choices (e.g., mesa view for stars) and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through borrowed personalities and star disappearances, driven by Mira's agency with the halo fragment and printing. Cost is legible in her self-loss, but the abstraction slightly limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like stars and borrowed selves, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (emotion as typography) that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic-mathematical voice that reflects Mira's mind under pressure. Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., "lucid turbulence") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in dense beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing letterpress operation, empathy transposition, and celestial erosion with risk-taking that heightens stakes. The conceptual shift at closure feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
