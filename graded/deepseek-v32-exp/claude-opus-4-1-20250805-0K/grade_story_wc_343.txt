<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's diligently curious nature is consistently embodied through her observations and micro-choices, compelling higher-stakes actions like following the murmurations. Her internal shift from seeking discovery to rediscovery is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her isolated dedication. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation roots all key turns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara redefines her purpose. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in her smile and adjustment to follow the starlings, with the hopscotch cipher as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the antique airship and hopscotch board constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively guides her navigation and discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as her observations of patterns deepen stakes and narrow options. Cost is legible in her isolation and the conceptual shift from discovery to rediscovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when she deciphers the starlings' writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through the child's note "How to find your way home." Subtext operates in the hopscotch board and phrasebook, resisting moralizing for resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., days blending) is taught and pays off in closure. Prose reflects Elara's curious, solitary nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision, and the closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of starlings as cartographers and hopscotch as cipher feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
