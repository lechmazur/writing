<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his heritage, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final testimony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in reclaiming his identity. The hovering trait complicates choices and integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong, with closure as a decisive change where Marcus's testimony transforms the lattice and reveals the truth. Cost is legible in the final image of the transformed testament. Orientation is clear early, and the plot escalates coherently from discovery to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the narrow door and confession booth. It charges the final image with the copper light and lattice, integrating sensory detail purposefully. The environment shapes tactics and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the journals to testifying through the lattice. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens with the supply boat deadline, and cost is felt in the emotional resolution. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and legacy emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the transformed lattice. Subtext operates in silence and implication, resisting moralizing. The concept integrates deeply with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marcus's mindset.

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes folklore with a prison setting in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight.
