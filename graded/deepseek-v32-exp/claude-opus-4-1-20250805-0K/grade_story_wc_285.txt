<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The woman's emotional burden is concretely realized, and the final choice to ease her pain is earned with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the accumulative drive lens holds throughout.

The rain gutter timeframe tightens tactics coherently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (woman's emotional burden) escalates through Thomas's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her tears and release. The distillation process deepens pressure meaningfully, foreclosing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of promises and distillation emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the fog and needle work.
