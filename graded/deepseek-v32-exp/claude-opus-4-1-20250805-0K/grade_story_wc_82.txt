<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of craftiness and grief, with concrete interiority shown through specific memories. Her internal conflict between pain and peace is dramatized in the vision of Lin's possible future, and the final transformation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the emotional torment of gem polishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing where grief is transformed into light, with felt cost in Mei's realization. The Accumulative lens holds throughout, building through patterned memories, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating tea garden and glass basilica constraining choices through gem polishing and charging the final image with lanterns. Sensory details are selective and reflect Mei's POV, such as the woven moonlight bridges and polished dream-gems.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the Accumulative lens, through densifying memories and the vision of Lin's possible future that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the "luminous torment" of creating dream-gems and the emotional price of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the origami crane metaphor and dream-gems, with subtext in implication rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief through the image of lanterns guiding others, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mei, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects her perception through rhythmic control and selective detail. No head-hopping; dialogue with Master Shen is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates with emotional beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "woven moonlight" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream recording, floating isle, and grief transformation feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like gem polishing. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
