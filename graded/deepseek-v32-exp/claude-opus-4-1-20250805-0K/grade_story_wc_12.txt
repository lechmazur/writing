<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Father Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with interiority shown through embodied actions like adjusting the loop pedal. His final choice to illuminate the demon is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in the woman's gasp and the palette's transformation. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as patience versus the urgency of the possession timeframe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Conceptual Repricing (stillness as possibility) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, held throughout. The cost is legible in the woman's independent breath and the palette clattering, revealing questions. Orientation is clear early, and the dimensional anchor persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cathedral setting, loop pedal, and dimensional anchor constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like acoustics and indigo color woven into action. Micro-setting elements (palette, anchor) directly influence the exorcism's outcome, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Accumulative lens, building layers of sound and rhetorical questions that tighten stakes. The cost is unmistakable in the demon's dissolution and the woman's freedom, with one meaningful deepening that forecloses the possession path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the looped prayers and the palette's transformation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about stillness and assumptions. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marcus's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the layered dialogue and narration, and any elision (e.g., rhetorical questions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language consistent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold issues obscure causality; minor density in peak beats doesn't harm closure, and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes exorcism tropes with unique elements like the loop pedal and rhetorical devices, creating a non-obvious, inevitable arc. Risk-taking in metaphorical language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
