<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied interiority and a credible earned change as she shifts from her father's claustrophobic safety to expansive wonder. The final choice to bring a vial to her father is motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in her expanded understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Mira's realization that safety can expand—under the accumulative/textural lens, which holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the gravity inversion and doll's transformation drive a coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The trellis setting and gravity inversion are vividly specific and constrain choices, charging the final image; sensory details like "clouds drift below like inverted mountains" are purposeful and integrated into Mira's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (internal conflict about safety), and escalation is driven by Mira's agency during the inversion, with cost legible in her decision to share the vial; under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—safety through expansion vs. contraction—with subtext in the doll and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose is poetic but consistent, and any elision (e.g., gravity inversion) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity, and sentences vary rhythmically without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original—harvesting silence during gravity inversion—with specific synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
