<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a memory-preserving chef. Her interiority is embodied through sensory details like tasting memories, and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pruning, planting the seed) reveal her values. However, the lack of strong contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score, though her final action is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the garden's creation, offering a felt cost in the risk of rebellion and the transformation's success. The causal lens holds strong, with events linked by cause and effect (e.g., celestial alignment triggering seed growth). Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of Ministry oppression shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective sensory details (e.g., violet sky, bioluminescent signals) and constrains Mira's choices, charging the final image. The setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states and supporting the theme without exposition. Its integration as a micro-setting that alters tactics meets the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (memory preservation vs. Ministry control) and escalate through Mira's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the garden's creation with visible cost. The alignment tightens decisions, and the resolution is earned by her actions, though the off-page antagonist slightly limits tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., the neural garden as beauty from ruins), with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but the line "Beauty from ruins" nudges toward explicitness, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's voice (e.g., "tasted the memories"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., Ministry backstory) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery (e.g., "neural garden painted memories"). No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. The closure image remains clear and charged, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes memory, rebellion, and botany into a fresh, inevitable whole, with specific details (e.g., synaptic plasticity) heightening stakes. Risk-taking in the lyric, causal design coheres without gimmickry, and the emotional truth avoids derivative templates.</comment>
