<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's motivation to escape immortality is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority like "the familiar ache of existence." Her final choice to step through the door is earned by prior causality, though some phrasing edges toward stock ("weight of existence"). Micro-choices, such as threading magnetic fields, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change—stepping through the door—with felt cost (abandoning immortality). Causal drive holds strong via because/therefore linkages (amulet response to storm, Vex's aid). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or teleporting props break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the prismatic escondite and solar storm constraining choices (magnetic fields mask approach) and charging the final image of emptiness. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. The escondite's properties actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vex's agency under the causal lens, from sensing the crew to fusing amulets and stepping through. Dominant stake (freedom vs. stagnation) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the foreclosed path of immortality. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—immortality as prison, transformation over safety—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the quiet door, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Vex's poetic yet restrained voice ("hushed thunder"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Thorne's plea). Purposeful compression, like "dimensional awareness," is taught and legible, though minor register consistency slips occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and pressure-appropriate. Minor overwriting in peaks ("electromagnetic fury") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of immortality, spatial mutiny, and cursed object feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details grounding tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, transformative ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to its implications.</comment>
