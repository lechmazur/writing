<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in curiosity and a drive to protect voices, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to run to the basement is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. However, minor reliance on diagnostic-like interiority ("she'd learned that twilight was when the dead called loudest") slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong linkage from inciting incident to closure; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a decisive change as Mara understands the theft and acts, with cost legible in the returning faces and her resolve. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reconfigures stakes with felt emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (mist, "cathedral of suspended gold") that pressure choices and charge the final image. The atrium acts as a micro-setting that constrains Mara's path and mirrors internal states. Specificity is high, with details like orchids leaning away, integrated into action and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving voices) escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, from following pulses to understanding the theft. Cost is visible in the fading photograph and her urgent run. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decodes the SOS rhythm, narrowing options and forcing action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and incidental heroism emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the hearing aid pulses and photo. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the final paragraph's echo of "refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear" leans slightly toward thematic summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, and elision (e.g., the hearing aid's mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language ("mist curled like breath through broken teeth") is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats ("cathedral of suspended gold") doesn't harm clarity. Rhythm supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing emotional contagion with supernatural detection in a fresh, specific way. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., hearing aid as tool). Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
