<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Net-mender's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., her fingers working the net reveal micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to mend the net and leave is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. However, slight lack of internal conflict in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "Tomorrow, a fisherman would cast this net without knowing she had mended it." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the parapet's whispers add persistent constraint. No causality breaks; closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "rain-scent" and "fireflies" filtering through POV. The parapet and bamboo whisk constrain choices and charge the final image, e.g., the whisk fracturing moonlight reveals patterns. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, stakes around hidden effort escalate through density increase and pattern breaks, e.g., the net's pattern mirroring firefly flights. Protagonist agency in whistling and mending drives deepening, with cost visible in the anonymous act. One meaningful tightening suffices, but escalation is slightly subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns emerges organically from particulars like the net-mending and firefly paths, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of anonymous care, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., the whistling as signal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, e.g., "moon fractured into a hundred crescents." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting in peaks like "scintillatingly somber rhythm" causes slight figurative muddle. No major loops or scaffold issues; sentence-level propulsion is strong, and closure remains clear. Deduction for density without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of net-mending and philosophy feels inevitable, with specific details like the bamboo whisk transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration of hidden efforts is bold and coherent.</comment>
