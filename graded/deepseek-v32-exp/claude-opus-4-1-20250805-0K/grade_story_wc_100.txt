<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's insomnia and undertaker profession are deeply integrated, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his final renunciation to become the library's guardian is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning his mortuary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost in Silas's departure note and new role; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of insomnia shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (e.g., "waterlogged and reeking of brine"); the underwater library constrains Silas's choices and charges the final image of earned sleep, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking rest escalates through Silas's agency under accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in his forfeiture of the mortuary, driving one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest and legacy emerges through concrete images and events, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent; minimal dialogue carries subtext; rhythmic control under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, dense prose with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and figurative language is purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker, insomnia, and underwater library feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific detail.</comment>
