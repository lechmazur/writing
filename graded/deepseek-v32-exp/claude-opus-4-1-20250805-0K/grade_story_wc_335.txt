<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara and Kess are richly characterized with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; Kess's shift from anger to understanding is earned through causal beats, though the transition is swift. Elara's "combative tenderness" and backward walking trait are consistently woven into actions and dialogue, reinforcing motivation. The final realization that Elara is teaching resilience lands with visible cost in Kess's aged eyes, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from shadow discovery to decoding; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Kess grasps the deeper lesson and the shadow settles, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the exile reversal shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the forgotten library and objects like the prism and tea leaves constraining choices and charging the closure; sensory details (e.g., "dusty light," "writhing shadow") are filtered through Kess's POV, avoiding generic description. The library's isolation and the tea leaves' geometry directly pressure the protagonists' actions, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile) escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency: Kess's emotional shift and collaborative decoding narrow options, with cost felt in her raw realization and the shadow's patience. One meaningful tightening occurs as the tea leaf spiral breaks, foreclosing easy solutions and deepening the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and mentorship emerges organically from particulars like the tea leaf method and shadow messages, with subtext in dialogue (e.g., "Hope is always a weapon"). The ending offers a non-literal answer through Kess's insight into self-salvation, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Kess, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical descriptions ("peculiar hush"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges like "Stop dangling hope like a weapon." Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language ("rust on iron") enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the decoding sequence, and the final line lands with resonant specificity, passing the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fantasy elements (shard-mirrors, reversible exile) with emotional depth through specific details like tea leaf geometry; tropes are transformed via character-driven choices, and risk-taking in blending mystical and mundane pays off in closure. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
