<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (longing vs. duty) acting simultaneously, and her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her physical strain and emotional toll. The moon-phase trait credibly constrains her actions, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the censer's scratches and her acceptance of duty, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the failed hydraulics shapes tactics until the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and bronze censer foot function as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., using the censer as a lever) and charge the final image with warmth and scratches, while sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Marina's urgency and priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the causal lens, from physical effort with the censer to high-stakes guidance for her brother, with cost legible in her shaking arms and emotional breaks. The dominant stake of safe passage tightens meaningfully through each call.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the censer and reverse migration, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to duty and loss through the final image of building bridges from words, without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice that modulates under pressure; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and any elision (e.g., cryptic calls) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control with no loops or scaffold, though minor overwriting in phrases like "geography of loss" slightly reduces clarity without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar apocalypse tropes with fresh, non-obvious angles (reverse migration, patchwork identity), and risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
