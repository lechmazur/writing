<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief that gardens respond to care over measured luck. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as polishing marbles to mend deceptions. The final choice to give a cracked marble to the young woman is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Marta passes on her method, reconfiguring the theme of luck and deception with felt cost. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages in her actions affecting the garden. Orientation is clear early, and the ending image charges prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains choices and supplies resources, shaping Marta's tactics against the Luck Index. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the whispering hedgerows, and recurring objects (marbles, wires) charge the final image. Setting is integral to the narrative arc, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving luck isn't measurable—escalates through Marta's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the plants' defiance and the inspector's confusion. One meaningful tightening occurs when she gives the marble, narrowing options and reinforcing the theme without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the cracked marbles representing mended deceptions, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the young woman's potential transformation, reweighting prior material with complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Marta's poetic yet pragmatic voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the young woman, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "a expression both blooming and withering," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of luck as a commodity and magical realism, transformed through specific details like the cracked marbles. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Originality is integral to character and conflict.</comment>
