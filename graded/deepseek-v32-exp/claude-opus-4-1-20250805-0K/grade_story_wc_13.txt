<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a naturalist illustrator and inherited duty. Her micro-choices under pressure, like diving through the temporal gap and completing the drawings, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, interiority could be deeper in peak beats, with some emotions told rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from inciting incident to closure, with because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change—freeing the creatures and cracking the pendant—with felt cost (time-sculptors' panic, reversed canals). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices and charges the final image: rooftop canals guide navigation, and Morteus's integrated form pressures the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "water flowing impossibly upward" and temporal residue, filtered through Marina's POV without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing trapped creatures vs. borrowed time) escalates through Marina's agency under the causal lens, from pendant hum to chamber discovery. Cost is legible in the pendant cracking and time-sculptors' loss, though the external conflict with sculptors is minor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring endings over preservation emerges organically from particulars like completing illustrations and Morteus waking. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of drawing living creatures, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature biased toward temporal and natural history details. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, though dialogue is absent. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "waterways had been built when time wasn't linear but sculptable." No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes time-sculpting, extinct echoes, and illustration into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the pendant's role and giant's nap. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
