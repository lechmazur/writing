<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as the last seed saver is clear and consistent, with embodied traits like "furiously tranquil" precision under pressure. Micro-choices, such as sorting seeds and placing the acorn cap, reveal her values and preparation. However, minimal internal contradiction or struggle slightly limits depth, though her earned renunciation of possession for continuation lands with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Mira reopens the garden and accepts ongoing responsibility, visualized in the new oak growing. Causal lens holds strong from incubation to stabilization, with orientation anchored early. The acorn cap's role as a key tightens options coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the icebound atrium's sublimation reveals living wood, and the crystalline dome filters starlight that activates the acorn cap. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image of planting, with sensory details woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from sorting seeds to reversing entropy, driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the responsibility inherited and the garden's renewal, foreclosing passive preservation. One meaningful tightening occurs as the vortex stabilizes, narrowing options to the decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: seeds compressed with time illustrate inheritance as continuation, not possession. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, via the oak that "remember[s] both past and future." Subtext in images like borrowed time as velvet deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic texture reflecting Mira's "furiously tranquil" state. Purposeful compression, like "wild serenity," modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story through concrete images. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally, and figurative language coheres without muddle. Peak beats, such as the vortex slowing, maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes seed saving with temporal physics in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like Cherokee Purple tomatoes humming with alternate summers. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
