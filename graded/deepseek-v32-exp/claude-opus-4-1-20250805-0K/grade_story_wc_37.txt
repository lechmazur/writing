<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trailing fingers across bark, starting with a whisper). Her final agency in leading the song is earned by prior causality, and the cost of ongoing effort is legible. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (dawn woven from communal choice) with felt cost ("they would need to sing again"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through memory layers and song. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; causality is tight, with no breaks or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the greenhouse and singing trees constraining choices (e.g., roots humming, iron framework ringing) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "bark that still held the ghost-memory of music"). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (rekindling the realm) escalate through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, from whispered lullaby to communal song, with cost legible in the ongoing need to sing. One meaningful tightening occurs as memories coalesce into light. No coincidence; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (communal memory creates light) emerges organically from images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates in gesture and song; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or drift; complexity is embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "scattered pearls from a broken necklace"). Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Experimental compression (e.g., lyric repetition) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "unraveling like a poorly-knitted shroud"). Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build; no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing memory, song, and communal effort into a non-obvious concept of woven dawns. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Details are specific and irreplaceable, avoiding template plots.</comment>
