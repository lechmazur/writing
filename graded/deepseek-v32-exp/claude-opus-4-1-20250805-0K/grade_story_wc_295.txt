<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deep flaws or internal contradictions, making her competent without significant struggle. Her final choice to pass on knowledge is earned, but the absence of contradictory impulses limits peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing where the shared burden reconfigures meaning, cost legible in "the burden was heavy, but shared across centuries, it became bearable." Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to realization, with no orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with selective sensory details like "whisper of starlight," and the daylily charges the final image, but it doesn't strongly constrain choices, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding cosmic messages escalates through Mira's agency, from decoding to shared revelation, with cost unmistakable in the burden of witness. Pressure coheres under causal lens, foreclosing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from events like the telegram and variable stars, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the relay of understanding. No moralizing; subtext operates through images like the daylily.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet scientific voice; dialogue advances plot naturally, and perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "like sunrise on an airless moon" enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lucid dreams and variable stars in a fresh, non-obvious way, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in cosmic loneliness feels authentic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
