<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as polishing the sea glass and recalling memories. The final choice to share the light is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing the old lighthouse way.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: Marina guides ships and teaches others, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by memory and sensory buildup. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of shared light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the serpentine grotto and mist constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated, such as the mist amplifying light. The environment shapes tactics and outcome, essential for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the sea glass's glow to creating a beacon. Dominant stake (guiding ships) tightens with visible cost in embracing a new method. Pressure coheres and deepens through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as finding light in unexpected places, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marina's realization and sharing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, like the sea glass's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Marina's astronomer background. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though minor register consistency holds it from highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful, but slight overwriting in descriptive passages prevents a higher score. Closure remains unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes familiar elements (sea glass, grotto) into a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific details and character choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and transformation feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
