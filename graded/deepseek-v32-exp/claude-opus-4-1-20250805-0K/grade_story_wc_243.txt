<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her archival role, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "walnut-ink stains" and "strange euphoria." Her internal conflict between truth and mercy acts simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned choice to add the codicil with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure, such as studying the locket photo, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is credible and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Mara adds the codicil and exchanges the covenant, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in her "haunted euphoria" and the locket as a "burden." Orientation is clear early with anchors like "blooming jetty" and "satchel." The structure is tight with one meaningful tightening from the discovered fire cause to the codicil action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "wisteria cascaded" and "amber light," filtered through Mara's POV. The jetty and wisteria recur and charge the final image, mirroring internal states. However, the environment does not directly constrain choices, though it enhances atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus mercy is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens, driven by her discovery of the fire's cause. The cost is unmistakable in her codicil action, which narrows options and reweights the covenant's meaning. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening that forces a trade-off between preservation and reckoning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the locket and codicil, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like Eleanor's "thank you" and Mara's "haunted euphoria." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "remembering everything," embracing complexity without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's professional lexicon and rhythmic prose. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "strange euphoria" at the climax. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as in Eleanor's whispered thanks. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "purple waterfalls" is coherent and purposeful. Syntax accelerates with pressure, e.g., the codicil addition. Closure image is clear without muddle, and proofreading is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh with a non-obvious synthesis of archival work and moral dilemma, transformed through specific details like the walnut ink and locket. Turns feel earned from character choice, not late rule changes. Risk-taking in the codicil action heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
