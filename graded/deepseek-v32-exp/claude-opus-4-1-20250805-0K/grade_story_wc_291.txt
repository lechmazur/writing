<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sarah's prosopagnosia and methodical nature are deeply integrated into her actions and choices, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her precise charcoal use and the final phone call. Her motivation to solve the case through art drives the plot, and her realization of the killer's motive feels earned. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Sarah calls the detective, underpinned by a causal lens where her investigative steps logically escalate to the revelation. The cost is legible in her trembling hand and the conceptual price of understanding "shattered minds." Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with mist and stone influencing atmosphere and action, such as the ribbon discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Sarah's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sarah's agency under the causal lens, as each portrait deepens stakes and narrows options toward the killer's identity. The cost is felt in her blackened fingers and the emotional weight of unifying contradictions. One dominant stake (solving the murders) tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of duality and fragmentation emerges organically through portraits and the killer's motive, with subtext in imagery like "contradictions stared back." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the composite portrait. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on texture and movement, reflecting Sarah's prosopagnosia. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., the killer's identity) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "light through prisms," is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a face-blind detective using art to solve crimes is a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Originality is integral to the story's logic.</comment>
