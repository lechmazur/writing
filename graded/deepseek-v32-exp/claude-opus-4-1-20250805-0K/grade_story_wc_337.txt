<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction could be more dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (spirits grounded, Mira's continued duty) under an accumulative lens, with felt cost in the transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and net function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid, selective sensory detail integrated into action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in unraveling knots, building density under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the spirits' release and her ongoing burden. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and peace emerges through concrete events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of mask restoration and interlaced hush offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
