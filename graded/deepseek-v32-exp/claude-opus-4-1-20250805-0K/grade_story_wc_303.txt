<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like forging papers. Her final renunciation of academic dreams for truth is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Interiority is concrete, though minor diagnostic speak ("tasting of mulberry wine") slightly detracts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as the violin sublimates and Marcus is cursed, costing Elara her empire but ensuring truth propagates. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from Elara's choices. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory and jasmine vine constraining choices and charging the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, though the environment's role in closure is strong but not indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. empire escalate through Elara's agency, culminating in her deceptive authentication that triggers the violin's justice. Cost is legible in her lost dreams, and pressure tightens under the causal lens with one meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images like the violin's song and coffee stains, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending that reweights dreams and empires without moralizing. Subtext in plant whispers enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent, though occasional ornate diction doesn't disrupt clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story without major loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, but minor overwriting in peaks ("mulberry wine" repetition) slightly reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ice-singers, plant telepathy, and coffee divination feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is coherent.</comment>
