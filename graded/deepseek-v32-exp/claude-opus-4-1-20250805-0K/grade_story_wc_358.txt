<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., adapting protocols, installing monitors). However, interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion; understanding "crystallized" feels summarized rather than earned in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—realizing the convergence is "emergence" not accident—and cost is legible in expansion threat. Causal lens holds tightly from investigation to action, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (rust-colored dust, metallic canyons) and constrains choice—the maze leads to convergence. Sensory details are purposeful, with wind patterns and convergence point charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from local investigation to global threat via Maya's agency (documenting, installing monitors). Cost is clear in convergence expansion, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation to emerging realities arises from particulars (patch, convergence) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (professional, precise). No dialogue, but prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure, though some phrasing leans slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no major loops. Minor overwriting in phrases like "atmospheric impossibilities" but clarity intact in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes investigation and sci-fi with originality; convergence concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in genre blend heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
