<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise with death's language, intensifying as she deciphers the captain's message. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure, such as photographing the journal and writing her note. The final choice to ascend with the snow globe is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the library's preservation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, though her competence borders on flawless, slightly limiting emotional struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Marina realizes letting go is transformation, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost in the library's impending flood. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered images and reflections. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the transmission invitation pays off at closure. Cost is legible in the air pocket contracting and her ascent bearing proof against forgetting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken library setting constrains choices through the air pocket and decaying books, charging the final image with the snow globe's recursion. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Marina's professional bias, such as "darkness thick as centuries." Micro-setting elements like the snow globe and journal are integral to tactics and closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the breached hull and contracting space pressuring ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Marina's agency in discovering the journal and snow globe, deepening her understanding of transformation. The dominant stake of comprehending loss tightens through her on-page choices, foreclosing the library's preservation with cost. Pressure coheres as the air pocket contracts, forcing her stance crystallization. Agency in writing the note and ascending shows a meaningful trade-off with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the snow globe's recursion and the transmission, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss. Subtext operates in implication, like the captain's journal entries and Marina's note, without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction. The final image of the snow globe turning argues against forgetting, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marina's analytical yet poetic voice. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, such as "crushing darkness" and "infinite regression of preservation." Purposeful elision in the transmission's origin is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific, with lyrical modulation supporting theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, as in "cathedral of trapped atmosphere" and "membrane between stories." Read-aloud ear test passes with syntactic variety. Line-level craft is flawless, with clarity and momentum sustained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar concepts (underwater exploration, recursion) into a fresh, non-obvious angle on loss and communication. The snow globe's infinite regression and the captain's entropy equations feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and philosophical theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, verifiable detail anchors universals, such as the Morse transmission and journal entries.</comment>
