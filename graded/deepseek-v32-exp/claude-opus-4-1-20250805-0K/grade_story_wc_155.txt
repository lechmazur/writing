<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to rediscover joy is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final decision to continue exploring is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ephemeral nature of her light-painting. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the realization that permanence isn't the point, but the act of remembering is—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the knowledge network's integration drives coherence. The final image of apple blossoms reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the ruined orchard district and fog pressuring choices, and the fresco fragment constraining and enabling actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's POV. The environment charges the final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as she actively paints with light and connects to the network, deepening the stake of rediscovering joy. Cost is legible in the ephemerality of the dreams and her decision to continue. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—the value of memory and shared joy in decay—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of apple blossoms, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in light-painting and the network, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marina's poetic, immersive voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the daydream fold) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats. Syntax varies naturally, supporting rhythm and emphasis without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of light-painting and knowledge network feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
