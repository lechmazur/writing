<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and an earned change to "salvage artist"; micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final renunciation is credible with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in Marina's commitment and the chemist's fade; orientation is clear early, and causality links discoveries tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glacier shrine setting constrains choices by enabling ghostly connections and charges the final image with constellation maps; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal salvage to global mission under Hybrid lens; Marina's agency drives tightening choices, with cost in her foreclosed normalcy and the chemist's sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., ghost manifestations) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, clarity untouched in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost whispering and salvage diving with fresh specificity; risk-taking in dream mechanics heightens stakes, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
