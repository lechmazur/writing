<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's bewilderment and temporal vertigo are embodied concretely; micro-choices under pressure, like retreating to the bathroom, reveal a hierarchy of values. Final understanding of nonlinear inheritance is earned through causal beats, with visible cost in the reconfiguration of her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the curator's realization that "inheritance follows no timeline," with cost legible in the final image of biting the apple. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the temporal loop pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astral orchard setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—e.g., the bathroom tree constrains access to revelation. Sensory details (petals falling upward, artificial atmosphere) are purposeful and charge the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding forbidden knowledge escalates under the hybrid lens through agency-driven inquiry and bathroom breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable in the curator's acceptance of temporal paradox, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically from particulars like the pistachio shell and ledger message; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "inheritance follows no timeline," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, e.g., "time grew like fruit on quantum branches." Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in exchanges with the other self.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight" is coherent and purposeful. Minor density in peak beats prevents a 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nonlinear time and astral setting feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
