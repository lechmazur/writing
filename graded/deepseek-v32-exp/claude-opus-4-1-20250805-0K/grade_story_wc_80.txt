<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict between official duty and personal mission is dramatized in scene, and the final act of hiding the note is earned with visible cost. The trait "stoically sensitive" constrains actions, such as when his composure cracks near his grandmother's memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as Charged Poise—the final image of encrypted dreams reconfigures meaning with felt cost in the impending demolition. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of water and time shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "carrying the weight of witnessed absence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, and the submerged pavilion constrains choices (e.g., wading, shifting floor) and charges the final image. Micro-settings like the inkwell and chandelier enrich atmosphere without stalling momentum, and POV filtering is consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memories escalates through accumulative density, driven by Edmund's agency in documenting and hiding the note. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight and foreclosed paths, though the escalation is more deepening than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of encrypted dreams, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective diction and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., the grandmother's backstory) is anchored in present stimuli and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is effective and coherent, even in peak beats like the "hushed blaze" image. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of climate change and memory, transformed through specific details like the surveyor as archaeologist of dreams. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
