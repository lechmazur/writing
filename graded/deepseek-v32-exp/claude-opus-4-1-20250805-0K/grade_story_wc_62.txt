<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Martha's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and grief, with interiority shown through embodied meditation and spectral guidance. Her final choice to complete the memorial is earned by prior causality, with cost in her grandfather's fading presence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her pressing too hard versus heeding advice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the memorial unites families and Martha finds her grandfather's poem, costing his presence but affirming collective strength. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of grief and migration tightening meaning. Orientation is solid early, and constraints like the ribbon and migration shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse, butterflies, and tools constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "cool glass" and "salmon sky" filtered through Martha's POV. Setting pressures her work and mirrors internal states, evolving with the narrative to support closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Martha's agency under the accumulative lens, with urgency from her grandfather and migration timeline forcing completion.

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images like the woven ribbon and butterfly migration, offering a non-literal answer to collective grief without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical prose, and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision like spectral voices is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "iron bones" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
