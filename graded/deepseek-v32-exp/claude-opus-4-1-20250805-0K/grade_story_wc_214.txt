<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kepler-9's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions embodied through actions like trembling fingers and whispered dialogues. The final realization of strength in vulnerability is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in their transformed perspective. Micro-choices under pressure, such as documenting by hand, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Kepler-9 reconfigures their understanding of strength and vulnerability, with felt cost in the acceptance of isolation. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the still star's phenomenon driving a coherent pressure that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tracking station and yellow lantern glass function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like the hum of the glass being purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment subtly mirrors internal states, such as the stillness of the star reflecting Kepler-9's emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kepler-9's agency in observing and documenting the still star, under the accumulative/textural lens, with a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is legible in their renewed purpose and the foreclosed path of believing isolation is weakness, charged by the final image of the fading star.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically from events and images, such as the still star representing fullness without motion, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kepler-9's realization, reweighting prior material like their obsolete post into a source of strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Kepler-9, with a distinct perceptual signature in their poetic, spiritually curious voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "watching this impossible star," and any elision is taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, such as "a heartbeat of pure light," is coherent and serves the climax without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, maintaining clarity and momentum through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor finding profundity in stillness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the yellow lantern glass ensure authenticity and transformation of tropes.</comment>
