<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia is embodied and drives micro-choices under pressure, such as navigating the lab despite her fear. Her motivation to remember Marcus is consistent and intensifies, compelling her to recover his journal and initiate the return protocol. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her annual return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Elena's silent witness and annual return. The causal lens holds tightly, from her descent to the discovery of the encoded messages. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tide timeframe persistently constraints tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded station setting pressures choices through confined spaces and the turning tide, charging the final image with the "crashing hush." Sensory details like "wan yellow pools" and the phase chamber's crystalline sphere are selective and POV-filtered. The environment constrains Elena's ascent and elevates the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, as she discovers the invisible messages and the threat to the cables. The dominant stake (remembering the unremembered) tightens with the tide's turn, forcing a trade-off between extraction and completion. Cost is legible in her silent endurance and annual return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and sacrifice emerges through particulars like the gold-flecked journal and phase-encoded messages, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elena's witness, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in her silence and the cables' humming conversations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet urgent prose ("neural pathways of a sleeping giant"). Voice modulates under pressure, such as the "crashing hush" mirroring emotional weight. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the threat's nature) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "amber preservative" for water. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating in discovery beats. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes undersea cables, phase transitions, and digital cancer with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure (Earned Stasis) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the gold fleck and tidal timeframe avoid template plots, offering a fresh angle on guardianship.</comment>
