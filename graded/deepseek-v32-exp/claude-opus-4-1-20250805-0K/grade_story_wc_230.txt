<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority shown through involuntary confessions and embodied emotion. Her final choice to distribute the cure is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her realization about discretion. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as doubting the cure while compelled to honesty, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Mara's ability to choose truth, reconfiguring her world with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot advances through because/therefore linkages, such as finding the truffles leading to the cure. The persistent constraint of truth compulsion shapes tactics, and cost is legible in her burden of discretion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like storm-bent branches and aromatic truffles, constraining choices through the ravine's terrain. The hanging orchard charges the final image with its metaphor of sideways growth, mirroring Mara's arc. Specificity is purposeful, integrated into action and perception without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curing truthfulness escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency, from finding the tin box to drinking the mixture. Cost is unmistakable in her gained burden of choice, foreclosing the path of brutal honesty. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the orchard's sideways growth symbolizing bent truth. Subtext operates in implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about honesty and mercy. No moralizing; complexity arises from particulars like Mara's confessions and cure distribution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature filtered through Mara's experience, such as noting "storm-bent apple branches like broken arms." Voice modulates under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "trees swaying like hanged men," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of empathy virus, truth compulsion, and discredited cures, transformed through specific character and world choices. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and turns feel earned in hindsight. Originality is evident in the non-obvious angle on familiar themes.</comment>
