<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her heritage and acoustic perception. Her micro-choices, like testing the acoustic space, reveal embodied emotion and values under pressure. However, internal contradiction is subtle, with minimal conflicting impulses in scene, preventing a higher score. The final renunciation of perfection is earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the chronic hush transforms into quietude holding space for the incomplete, with felt cost in the loss of the rainforest. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the greenhouse setting persistently constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks constraining choices through acoustics and symbolism. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, charging the final image. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming silence) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency in playing, drawing others, and transforming the hush. Cost is legible in the acceptance of imperfection and loss. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices, though it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically through events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "perfect incompletion." Subtext operates in silence and gesture, and the concept integrates seamlessly with character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature focused on acoustics. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains consistent. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of acoustic perception and post-disaster renewal, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
