<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliza's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictions like acknowledging Thomas's destruction while following his repair instructions. Her final choice to not carry his breaks forever is earned through prior causality and micro-choices under pressure. Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his ministry, adding secondary pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Eliza's realization about deserving better. Causal lens holds tightly from Marcus's delivery to Eliza's repair. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the clockwork heart constrains tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of the music playing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like dust motes and rain-slicked streets filtering through POV. The music box shop and clockwork heart constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting elements like the workbench and tools are integrated into action, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Eliza's internal conflict over forgiveness, escalating through her agency in repairing the clockwork. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to work with Marcus, leading to a cost-legible renunciation of carrying past breaks. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and repair emerges organically through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in dialogue like "second opinions" and the final choice to turn apology into action. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature from Marcus's POV and Eliza's dialogue. No head-hopping; POV distance is stable. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Minor shifts in focalization are controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "vibrant hush" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and character without register drift. Peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of clockwork repair and apology transforms familiar tropes through specific details. Emotional truth is specific, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with ingenuity in the clockwork heart as a metaphor.</comment>
