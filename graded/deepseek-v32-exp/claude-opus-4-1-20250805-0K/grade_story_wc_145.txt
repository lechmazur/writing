<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Margot's dry wit and secret obsession are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing phrasebook, deciding to trust) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from falcon's arrival to condensation revelation, culminating in a decisive change (sharing research) with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and closure reconfigures options under persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (rusted outpost, frozen lake) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (frost patterns, pressure ridges) filtered through POV bias. The environment actively shapes tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding river sources) escalate through agency-driven turns (condensation discovery, inspector's arrival), narrowing options with cost legible in Margot's risky decision. Coherent pressure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (hidden truths, patience) emerges through particulars like the phrasebook and convergence point, with a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gesture and image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (dry wit, professional focus). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with psychic distance shifts intentional. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("frozen lake stretched like a cataract eye") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes atlas editing and subterranean rivers with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in structure (condensation revelation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
