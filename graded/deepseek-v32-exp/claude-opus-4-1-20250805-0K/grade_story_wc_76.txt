<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions like "bleak exhilaration." Her final choice is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No significant weaknesses; closure cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (bleak exhilaration), under a causal lens that holds. Orientation is anchored early, and structure is coherent with single POV. The hunger stone's inversion lands with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "water dripped backward up the walls" constraining choices. The lighthouse and hunger stone charge the final image, and specificity reflects POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, and cost is legible in the climax. The reversal narrows options with visible price, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in actions like reversing mechanisms. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Prose reflects character mind-state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and clarity is maintained in peak beats like the stone's inversion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity, transforming tropes through character choices. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
