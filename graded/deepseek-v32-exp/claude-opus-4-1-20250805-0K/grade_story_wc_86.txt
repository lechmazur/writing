<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, balancing vengeance with wisdom under pressure; her final choice to delay forgiveness is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the conditional acceptance of Thorne's apology. Thorne's relief and guilt are embodied in micro-choices like his shoulders dropping. No diagnostic label-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the "darkness that would make them all equal," under a causal lens where the drawer pull and moon phases shape tactics. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with a persistent constraint in the recycled wisdom motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The parapet and mist create a purposeful atmosphere that mirrors internal states, but the drawer pull as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, elevating specificity. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in redemption escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, forcing a trade-off between vengeance and forgiveness with cost legible in her conditional acceptance. The tightening forecloses the path of immediate retaliation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of recycled sorrow emerges through particulars like the drawer pull and moon phases, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "wisdom was just recycled sorrow." Subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical control, e.g., "furrowed hush"; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot without register mismatch. Elision in backstory is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "neutral territory stretched like a scar" is purposeful and clear. No overwriting or coherence issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices like the drawer pull's history and moon phase mechanics, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
