<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus Chen is vividly characterized with consistent serenity and a revolutionary heart, embodied in micro-choices like tracing the story stick. His motivation to explore ethical storytelling drives the narrative, though minor lack of on-page internal conflict under pressure prevents the highest band. The final choice to reverse the narrative is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the story stick's weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus's preparation for the puppet show reconfigures storytelling ethics. Cost is unmistakable in "its weight a reminder of responsibility," and the dome's interference patterns reveal hidden truths. Orientation is clear early, and the structure teaches its pattern through reflective shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The radar dome is indispensable, constraining choices with its acoustic properties and charging the final image through broken panels and meteor light. Sensory details like whispers as cathedral echoes are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV. It acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics and deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in ethical storytelling escalates under accumulative lens through Marcus's agency to reverse narrative flow, narrowing options with cost in responsibility. The argument's aftermath deepens thematic weight, and his decision to use luminescent calligraphy forecloses paths with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events like the puppet shows and story stick, offering a resonant answer through the meteor hush image without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the notches representing extinguished fires. Complexity embraces ambiguity, and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose that reflects Marcus's calligraphic precision. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "meteor hush" rhythmically controls pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "cathedral echo" is coherent and purposeful, and clarity persists in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with natural momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes elements like subversive puppet shows and radar dome into a fresh, inevitable whole, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in backward narrative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. The concept feels singular and authentic.</comment>
