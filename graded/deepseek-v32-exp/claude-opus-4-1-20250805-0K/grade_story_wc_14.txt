<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., "fingers ached from writing") and micro-choices under pressure. However, lacks internal contradiction or impulsive shifts, preventing higher scores despite strong dedication to her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the earned stasis of her ongoing mission, driven by an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the trees' memory shapes tactics, with cost legible in the physical effort and thematic protest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, as the bonsai forests and fountain are integral to the method of charting frequencies. Sensory details are purposeful and charge the final image, with no generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through the gradual deepening of her measurements, with cost unmistakable in the aching fingers and luminous protest. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening reweights the stake of recovering forgotten histories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges through concrete actions and images, like the gold-leaf notepad and trees' recall, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the concept of inventing histories back into existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects the stationer's focus. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats, and propulsion is maintained through concise, image-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of documenting electromagnetic time patterns, transformed through specific details like the bonsai and lamp method. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
