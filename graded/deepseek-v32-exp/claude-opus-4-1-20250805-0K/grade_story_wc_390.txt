<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in ancestral duty, with concrete interiority shown through embodied emotion like trembling hands. Her final choice to become sound is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her humanity with visible cost. Contradictory impulses of fear and duty act simultaneously in scene, such as when she hums while feeling the door's resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (Mira's transformation) and felt cost (loss of physical form), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent time pressure shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the image of her folded coat and dispersed voice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the drift-ice marina pressuring choices through fracturing ice and Collector arrivals. Sensory details like "frozen metal door" and "honey and blood" sunset are filtered through Mira's POV. The lighthouse and artifact as micro-setting constrain choices and charge the final image of her eternal song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, with stakes signaled early (protecting the artifact) and tightening as Collectors approach. Her vibrational matching narrows options, and the cost is unmistakable in her physical dissolution. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her actions directly lead to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring sacrifice and tradition through the resonant image of Mira becoming sound. Subtext operates in gestures like her folded coat, and the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm that heightens pressure, such as "bone could conduct the sacred songs." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure. Voice remains coherent under stress, with diction matching Mira's expertise and emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "vibrations travel through her skull like whispered prayers." Sentences vary in structure, advancing momentum and clarity, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of sonic absolution and becoming sound is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like vibrational matching and the azure coat. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure is fully integrated.</comment>
