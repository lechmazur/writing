<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sarai's characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses—guilt versus purpose—shown through micro-choices like placing the tessera. Her final realization that the curse is an invitation is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her weeping and the mosaic's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Sarai understands her curse as an invitation, landing with cost in the mosaic shift and her resolve to create anew. The causal lens holds tightly, with visions leading directly to this reconfiguration, and orientation is clear from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting—ancient plaza, shattered sky—constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "frost coating the ancient plaza" woven into action. The tessera as a micro-setting object actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sarai's agency under the causal lens, as placing the tessera triggers visions that deepen stakes and lead to a cost-legible transformation. The dominant stake of redemption tightens through her altered understanding and the mosaic's acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through particulars like the mosaic's reconfiguration and Sarai's actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and the final image of "cradling empathy in arms of steel."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("warm coldness") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue with the old man is natural and goal-driven, and elision in visions is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "shattered sky" is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum cleanly, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The retrocognitive curse premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and emotional specificity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
