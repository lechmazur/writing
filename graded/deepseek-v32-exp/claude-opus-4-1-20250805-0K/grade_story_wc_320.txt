<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as an interpreter seeking personal truth beyond Guild dogma. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as the fragment thrumming against her ribs. Her final decision to teach others is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in Maya's changed perspective and decision to teach. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and thematic density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the fragment's resonance constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with the towers and lunar perigee directly affecting Maya's actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the mist rising from the gorge. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her tuning with intention narrows options toward the shard discovery. Cost is legible in her foreclosed commercial path and renewed purpose. Stakes are signaled early and deepen through gravitational distortion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in endings emerges through events and images, not statement, with the shard of hush embodying potential. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Maya's realization. Subtext operates in silence and resonance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a perceptual signature, such as noting "crater shadows shifting." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., the six-hour gap) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors (e.g., "congregation of metal prophets") does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic signals and personal quest with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
