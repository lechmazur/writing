<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's methodical nature warring with playfulness is embodied in scene, and her final choice to embrace curiosity is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she seals the nickel away. Internal contradiction acts simultaneously under pressure, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elena's decision to seal the nickel, foreclosing certainty for wonder. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of sound and dreams tightening coherently. Orientation is clear early, and the pause moment expands meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden's acoustic panels actively constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like fractured voices and pulsed sounds woven into action. Specificity is purposeful, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the Accumulative lens, from discovering the nickel to the time loop revelation, forcing a trade-off between certainty and curiosity. Cost is legible when she chooses to seal the magic, narrowing options with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cycles and choice emerges through particulars like the coin's faces and mural layers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending reweights prior material with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Elena's voice modulates under pressure, and rhythmic control supports surreal elements. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "painted dreams breathed" is coherent and voice-motivated, and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mural restoration, sound architecture, and time loops feels inevitable, with risk-taking in surreal elements that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals, and the premise is fully committed.</comment>
