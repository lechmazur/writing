<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like tracing initials. Her internal conflict between dread and fierce tenderness acts simultaneously in scene, and the final renunciation to document despite loss is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like trembling fingers compound under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Marta transforms loss into legacy. The thaw accelerates pressure coherently, and cost is legible in the blurring walls and her relentless work. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the grotto and waterfall constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like rosewater scent and mineral weeping are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marta's POV. The opera glass lens and bakery alcove function as micro-settings that alter tactics and deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving history escalates under the Accumulative lens, driven by Marta's agency against the accelerating thaw. Cost is unmistakable in the weeping walls and her frantic tracing, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening forecloses live options, with visible price paid in blurred sections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and legacy emerges organically from particulars like bread initials and fading frescoes, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marta's transformation of loss into legacy. Subtext operates in objects and actions, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical yet controlled prose. Voice modulates under pressure, such as the shift from dread to tenderness, without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., Henrik's warning) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "palimpsest of memory" is consistent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the thaw, maintaining momentum through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grotto city, opera glass lens, and bread initials feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like Katarin's harvest songs anchor universals, avoiding template plots. Transformation of displacement tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
