<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is rooted in grief and love, with interiority shown through embodied actions like trembling hands and touching the ribbon. Her internal conflict between isolation and teaching is dramatized in scene, and the final choice to mend the eyes is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Mira's feistiness constrains actions, and their relationship forces meaningful change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: the breached contract forces Elara's return, leading to the mending and reconciliation. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the vow falling away like leaves—and the persistent constraint of dying eyes shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard cathedral constrains choices, requiring rope ladders and branching work, and charges the final image with the gleaming quartz eyes. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, such as rotting doors and apple blossoms. Spatial choreography is coherent during the climb and mending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the quartz eyes and bridging wisdom escalates through Elara's agency, driven by Mira's persistence and the dying eyes' urgency. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of overcoming grief and the Council's disapproval. A meaningful tightening occurs as they mend the eyes, narrowing options and redefining tradition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom through teaching emerges organically from events like the orchard's growth and the mending process, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of mended eyes and the fallen vow. Subtext operates in gestures like the ribbon tying, and ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction like "deciduous vows." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, distinguishing characters—Mira's feisty tone versus Elara's reflective voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and closure image is sharp and unmetaphorical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quartz-eye mending, orchard cathedral, and deciduous vows feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in setting and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific and grounded in character choices, not generic templates.</comment>
