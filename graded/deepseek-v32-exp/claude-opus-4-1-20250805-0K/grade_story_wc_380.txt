<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through concrete details like the warm wildflowers. Her final choice to keep only one memory vial is earned by prior causality, demonstrating credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the desire to reclaim memories versus the acceptance of buried grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Marina's decision to integrate grief slowly. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns (coffee grounds, salt formations) escalating to revelation. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, leading to the grave exhumation and understanding of the whale's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the salt crystal chamber and gravity pockets constraining choices and charging the final image of bending lanterns. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as floating headstones and swirling coffee, filtered through Marina's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, from observation to exhumation and decision. The dominant stake (understanding grief and gravity) tightens through pattern recognition, with cost legible in her restrained reclamation of memories. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and memory emerges organically through particulars like the wildflowers and vials, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as Marina reads new patterns "with eyes that remembered how to grieve."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "gravity forgot its own rules." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the exhumation. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of gravity pockets and buried memories, transforming grief tropes through specific world logic. Risk-taking in blending fantasy with emotional depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
