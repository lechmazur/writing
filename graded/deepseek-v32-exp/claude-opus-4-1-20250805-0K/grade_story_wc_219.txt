<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's skepticism is concretely embodied and evolves under pressure, with micro-choices like placing the amber revealing hierarchy of values. Her final realization that rebellion was scripted is earned by prior causality, though the shift from skeptic to acceptor feels slightly rapid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the artificial pilgrimage's purpose reweights humanity's place with undeniable cost in the final image of seekers converging. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the amber's reveal drives the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower and sculpture path constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory details like "bronze light" and "dampened sound" filtered through Elena's POV to mirror internal states and heighten atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elena's agency under the causal lens, from examining symbols to placing the amber, forcing a trade-off in understanding with conceptual cost. The climax narrows options by revealing the experiment, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of engineered faith emerges through particulars like the amber's DNA and pilgrimage network, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about homecoming without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery like "frozen supplicants."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—academic skepticism blending with lyrical doubt. Dialogue with Marcus is natural and goal-driven, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("luminous and terrible").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "chemistry of homecoming" is coherent and purposeful, and sentence propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes first contact and artificial pilgrimage with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details like neurochemical triggers. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
