<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her embodied emotions and micro-choices, like trembling fingers and whispered forgiveness, reveal internal conflict and earned closure with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Thomas solidified but not fully human); causal lens holds with tight because/therefore linkages from Mara's purification and beckoning to his return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the lighthouse constrains choice through the ascent, and the vial cork charges the final image, integrating purposefully with stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reuniting with Thomas) escalates through Mara's agency; her beckoning forces a trade-off with cost legible in the altered reunion, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love and forgiveness emerges through images and actions; the ending's two shadows offer a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating under pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., Thomas's past) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; minor overwriting in "screaming tenderness" slightly muddles peak beats, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes love and intention manifesting reality with specificity; turns feel earned and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
