<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is clear and rooted in her role; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Her final choice to encode wonder into the bells is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the melting ice. However, seasonal muteness is underutilized in on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens; the bells' transformation broadcasts wonder with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the bell tower and bells constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mariel's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mariel's agency under the accumulative lens, with urgency from the melting ice tightening stakes. Cost is legible in the fragment's loss, though stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a non-literal answer to preserving wonder without moralizing. Subtext in the bells and color deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., seasonal muteness) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats slightly reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-language world and preservation of wonder, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
