<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her connection to her grandmother, with embodied emotion (e.g., tears catching light) and micro-choices under pressure, such as activating the interface. The final choice to preserve shadows is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (luminous regret and the stone's warmth) as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. The shadow's journey and river stone provide persistent constraints, and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library and river stone are vivid, sensory-rich settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Specific details like "glass petals" and "bio-glass membranes" are filtered through Mira's POV, integrating environment with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her investigation tightens through footage comparison to the shadow's metamorphosis. The cost is legible in her regret and the weight of generational waiting, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as the shadow collecting hope, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's purpose, reweighting prior material with complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature (e.g., "walls that hummed with stored memories"). Rhythm and diction control under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor poetic density in peaks may slightly obscure clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of shadows preserving dreams is fresh and transformed through specific details like the river stone and generational connection. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
