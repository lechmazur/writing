<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and drives the plot; his interiority is embodied through specific actions like gait recognition and map use. The final choice to give away the coin is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shift of authority. Minor lack of internal contradiction under pressure prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Chen's acknowledgment and coin transfer, reconfiguring authority with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by Marcus's actions and established constraints like the maps and storm. Orientation is clear early, and no plot breaks harm causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the metallic groaning and aurora light, constraining choices through the storm and labyrinth. The environment pressures tactics and charges the final image, but minor reliance on visual senses limits a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, with the storm forcing the confrontation and cost legible in Chen's realization. The dominant stake of proving whispers vs. shouts tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and symbols like the coin and whispers, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but the theme is slightly overt in the final dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on gaits and maps; voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, but minor convergence in emotional peaks prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "whispered prayer" enhances atmosphere without muddle. Line-level craft supports clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of quiet wisdom vs. loud authority, with specific details like the zodiac coin and gait recognition transforming tropes. Risk-taking in structure is moderate but coherent, supporting stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
