<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; the seer's contradictory impulses between prophecy and gardening are dramatized in scene, and her final choice to plant seeds is earned through prior causality with visible cost in forsaking visions for growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible when she "didn't seek visions of tomorrow"; the lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of prophetic weight shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the labyrinthine bookstore and garden chamber constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are filtered through the seer's tactile perception, enhancing atmosphere without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increase in memory and sensation; protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost unmistakable in the renunciation of prophecy for planting, foreclosing a path with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stone and seeds, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to self-rediscovery; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in imagery (mercury vs. soil).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice exhibits a distinct perceptual signature rooted in the seer's silver-blind perspective, with rhythmic control and consistent POV; elision (e.g., sensory focus) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the planting scene, maintaining propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes (oracle, lost object) into a fresh, inevitable whole through specific lived detail; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels fully integrated.</comment>
