<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concretely embodied, with contradictory impulses like numbness versus remembered terror acting in scene. His final choice to create a third consciousness is earned through sparring and Master Chen's guidance, with cost legible in the closure. Micro-choices under pressure, such as catching the sword reflexively, reveal his hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost felt in "To feel what we couldn't. To live beyond our shared death." The causal lens holds tightly from court ruling to sparring-induced revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of numbness shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo constrains choice through low gravity sparring, and the brain jar charges the final image. Sensory details like "crystalline walls" and gravity hum are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with environment actively shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from numbness to sparring to the decision to vivify the brain. Cost is unmistakable in the closure's trade-off: embracing possibility to overcome shared emptiness. The dominant stake of defeating emotional numbness tightens meaningfully through Master Chen's guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sparring as thesis-antithesis-synthesis and the jar's symbolic weight, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "Numbness is just possibility waiting to be born," reweighting prior material through conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Marcus's hollow voice reflected in diction like "voice hollow as the stone chambers." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though Master Chen's lines occasionally edge toward formal didacticism. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "numbness is just possibility waiting to be born" serve multiple jobs without padding. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure clarity is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes consciousness splitting and emotional numbness with a fresh, non-obvious angle through complementary opposites. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in character choice and world logic. Risk-taking in thematic depth and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis is specific and memorable.</comment>
