<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is consistent and motive-driven, with micro-choices like confiding in Marcus revealing her values under pressure. Interiority is embodied through actions with the cards and tape, though internal conflict is subtle. The final choice to honor the 43-day rhythm is earned by prior causality, with cost in the conceptual preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from investigation to revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the understanding of the Jakarta network's rhythm reconfigures their approach, with cost legible in the final image of "ghost data singing through the walls." Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the rain-beaded skylight loft and salvaged servers constraining Vera's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception, enhancing the theme of digital archaeology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving digital cultures, escalating through Vera's agency in revealing the 43-day pattern. The tightening deepens knowledge and forecloses options, with conceptual cost in decentralized preservation. Driven by protagonist under the causal lens, cost is unmistakable in the synchronization revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultural persistence through digital patterns emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of human communities finding new paths, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—analytical yet poetic—modulating under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot with subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "measuring tape coiled beside them like a sleeping snake." Sentences advance story without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of cartomancy and digital archaeology, transformed through specific details like carbonized hard drive ink. Risk-taking in genre blending heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
