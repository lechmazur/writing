<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is deeply rooted in her role as a noticer of anomalies, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Her final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost in her ongoing commitment. Contradictory impulses are shown in her "cursed awareness" transforming into "ministry," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative drive lens, with patterns of impossibility escalating to the tea house revelation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Lila accepts her role, with cost legible in "She would return tomorrow to plant them." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the overgrown palace courtyard and tea house constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "smelling of rosemary and time" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment actively shapes tactics, as the gardens hide and permit the tea house's existence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on Lila's quest to find the sacred, escalating under the accumulative lens through density of anomalies. Protagonist agency drives escalation, culminating in her acceptance of seeds with cost in continued responsibility. A meaningful tightening occurs as her role is redefined, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in the ordinary emerges organically through events like the bread uncloaking and gardening, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and implications, such as bread as memories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lila's realization and the seeds, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable single POV and perceptual signature in Lila's unique observations. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the tea house conversation. Purposeful compression, like "forgiveness and time," is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "bread that tasted of forgiveness and time." Syntax varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of magical realism and guerrilla gardening, transforming tropes through specific details like midnight lettuce. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with conceptual integrity.</comment>
