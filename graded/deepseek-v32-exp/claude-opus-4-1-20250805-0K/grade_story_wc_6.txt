<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply rooted in her backstory and profession, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. Her motivation to transform her father's legacy drives the narrative, and her final choice to graft the talisman is earned through prior causality. The internal conflict between fire and water is shown simultaneously in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Maya integrates her past. The accumulative/textural lens holds, focusing on internal transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand are vivid, sensory-rich settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Details are filtered through Maya's POV, and the environment mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal transformation, escalating through the ritual and memories. Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens with Maya's agency, and cost is legible in her emotional shift. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars and transformation emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice that reflects Maya's mindset. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of arsonist's daughter firefighter and ritual grafting feels fresh and organic. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and the synthesis is inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes.</comment>
