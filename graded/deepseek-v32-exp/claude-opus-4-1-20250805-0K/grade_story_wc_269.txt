<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's legacy, with embodied interiority shown through tapping rhythms and observations. Her final choice to dive is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her determination. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in Lena's decision to descend, reconfiguring her understanding of transformation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern-building via tapping and coral imagery. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of her face superimposed over the coral city.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the monitoring station and coral reef constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV. The environment shapes tactics, as seen in her use of the station to lower the anchor and dive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the Accumulative lens, through observations and tapping that lead to revelation. Dominant stake of discovery tightens with her realization, foreclosing prior misunderstandings with cost visible in her decision to dive. No coincidence; pressure coheres until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and memory emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the coral city metaphor, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the tapping rhythm and coral patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and rhythmic, reflecting Lena's mindset. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Prose syntax varies naturally under pressure, enhancing emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally, e.g., in the tapping descriptions. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of climate change and transformation themes, with non-obvious angle on coral bleaching. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the atlas page and tapping rhythms feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
