<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving proactive choices like redirecting flows, with embodied emotion in "stoic wonder." However, lacks internal contradiction or flaws that complicate decisions, preventing higher score despite earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the terminal hums alive, costing effort shown in "rust flaked away." Accumulative lens holds tightly, with orientation clear early and persistent constraint of sextant shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choice through hydraulic pipes and sextant, charging the final fountain image. Sensory details like "cracked terrazo floors" are POV-filtered and purposeful, elevating stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maya's agency under accumulative lens, from finding sextant to redirecting flows, with cost legible in system's groans. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks multi-layered conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope engineered through infrastructure emerges implicitly from events, with final image of water arcs offering resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in system's design enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic descriptions like "permanent enchantment of infrastructure." Rhythmic control under pressure, though no dialogue to test character voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or muddle, e.g., "Water arced in precise parabolas." Figurative language serves closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering and aspiration feels inevitable, with risk-taking in hydraulic system as navigational instrument heightening stakes. Specificity in details like sextant piece avoids derivative premise.</comment>
