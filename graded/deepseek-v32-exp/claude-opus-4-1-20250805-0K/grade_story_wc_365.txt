<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and rooted in her search for her mother, with interiority shown through sensory perceptions and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to map repairs is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the realization of their gift's destructive nature. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied in the shard's pulses and the weight of truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly from start to closure, with clear because/therefore linkages in Kira's redirects leading to the nexus meeting. Closure is a decisive change—the shard dissolves as mother and daughter commit to repairing realities—with cost legible in the fraying edges of reality and the transformation of their purpose. Orientation is anchored early in the repair bay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the abandoned spaceport repair bay constraining choices by transforming across universes and charging the final image as a place of restoration. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., rust as copper bells, bioluminescent fungi), integrating into action and theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the mother and the truth—escalates through Kira's agency in redirecting between worlds, culminating in a meaningful tightening where the revealed damage forces a new goal. Cost is unmistakable on-page in the unraveling realities and the shift from exploration to repair, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from curse to cure emerges organically through events and images, such as the shard's dissolution and the repair bay's restoration, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the mother's exile and the cyclical shard, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to exploration's costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Kira's sensory perceptions shaping voice and diction. Purposeful compression in world-weaving is taught early and legible at closure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "synesthetic ribbons") is coherent and voice-motivated, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes sensory mapping and multiverse travel with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices like the shard's cyclical nature and the damage revelation. Risk-taking in synesthetic descriptions heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
