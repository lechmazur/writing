<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving her planned heist with consistent traits. Interiority is concrete, such as "bleak exhilaration," and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. However, internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from Amira's actions to the discovery and data transmission. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in security's arrival and her smile, proving the unfiltered awakening has begun. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating observatory's elevation thinning boundaries to constrain choices. The geode as a micro-setting charges the final image of hope, and sensory details like "crystalline interior" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of returning unused potential escalates under causal lens through Amira's agency, with tightening from spiking readings to security alarm. Cost is legible in the risk taken, and the resolution forecloses secrecy with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming lost futures emerges through particulars like the geode and quantum fields, with subtext in "pooling no more in darkness." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the unfiltered awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending scientific and emotional tones. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Chen's hesitation, and elision like "bleak exhilaration" is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "pools of unused potential," and figurative language is coherent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes quantum physics and grief into a fresh, inevitable angle, with risk-taking in the elevated setting and core premise. Specific details like perturbation theory transform tropes through character-driven choices, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
