<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her failure and quest for meaning. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as the keystone's weight and her laughter. The final choice to embrace imperfection is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in discarding the medallion. Contradictory impulses act in scene, e.g., her rejection of Academy values versus trust in mist walking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the spire catching "the first light of things that always would." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery to redefine imperfection. Orientation is clear early, and the keystone's persistent constraint shapes the final image. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the icebound spire and mist sea constraining choices—Mira steps onto nothing, and the environment charges the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "frost-covered window" and "lingering luminance." The keystone as a micro-setting object evolves meaning, supporting the theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning in automation escalates through Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to unstrap the medallion and step onto mist tightens options, with cost in rejecting Academy values. The deepening occurs as the keystone warms and luminance shifts, leading to the realization about imperfection. Cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacred imperfection emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the discarded medallion and the keystone's reprise. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "brilliant dimness," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from Mira's specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "brilliant dimness" and "lingering luminance." Voice is lyrical and coherent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the Accumulative drive, with syntax reflecting Mira's mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "needle through silk" and "sea of ghosts." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of magic vs. automation, transformed through specific details like mist walking and the keystone. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
