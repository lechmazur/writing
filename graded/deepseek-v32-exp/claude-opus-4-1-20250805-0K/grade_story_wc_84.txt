<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and drives choices, with micro-actions like using the drone's sensors under pressure. However, her emotional shift from surprise to wonder feels somewhat told rather than fully embodied, and internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via Kira's realization of cosmic belonging, felt cost in her transformed perspective. Causal-Accumulative Hybrid lens holds strong from anomaly discovery to matrix activation, with matrices as persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with observatory at dusk, sensory details like "copper light" and thermal imaging; environment constrains choices (tile-pulling, drone use) and charges the final image with projected star trails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging escalates through Kira's agency (drone deployment, tile-pulling) under Hybrid lens; cost is legible in her internal reconfiguration, though stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic belonging emerges organically through star patterns and frequencies, with resonant non-literal answer in the ending; pilgrim's dialogue risks explicitness but avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Kira's observational voice; dialogue for pilgrim feels natural and goal-driven, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with varied rhythms, but minor overwriting like "brilliant dimness" and slight template cadence in descriptive passages; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech and mysticism with specific details; transforms tropes through Kira's arc, though not fully groundbreaking; risk-taking in hybrid structure supports stakes.</comment>
