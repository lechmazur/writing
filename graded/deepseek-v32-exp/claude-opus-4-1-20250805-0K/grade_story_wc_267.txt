<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with frostbite sensations and micro-choices like keeping the bolt revealing his hierarchy of values. Elena's return and whispered confession show credible endurance and renunciation, earned by prior causality. The final choice to offer the bolt and the new composition is motivated with visible cost, though Elena's articulation of theme in dialogue slightly edges toward diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the new composition reweights silence and sound with cost legible in the warming walls. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the discolored step acts as a persistent constraint shaping Marcus's understanding. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from the incident to Elena's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress setting pressures choices through icy details and acoustic channels, while the discolored step and piano bolt function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV, though the fortress's warming at the end slightly strains established physical logic without full payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with Marcus's discoveries and Elena's return deepening the stakes around silence and sound. The cost is unmistakable in the nerve regeneration and fortress's hum, and the dominant stake is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena plays the new composition, foreclosing the path of mere repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bolt and Elena's scars, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new composition, avoiding moralizing. However, Elena's line about "truth" and "performance" leans toward thematic echo, though it's integrated into character voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct through Marcus's perceptual signature, with lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Elena's whispered confession. No head-hopping or register drift; elision around the incident is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though phrases like "seraphically mundane" and "frostbitten hope" risk slight ornamentation without harming clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes silence and sound in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like the acoustic channels and nerve regeneration. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
