<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her gift and the amber pendant, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action of tattooing the constellation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the amber cracks. However, her agency feels slightly passive at times, relying on future knowledge, but this does not majorly undermine her characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a hybrid drive lens with causal linkages (e.g., Mara's summons leading to her intervention) and accumulative texture (guilt and memory themes). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in the cracked amber and the firmware's gratitude, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is established early within 120 words, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and amber object actively constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details (e.g., the humming pendant, flickering screen) woven purposefully into action. The environment shapes tactics, such as using the amber as a lens, and the micro-setting of the terminal amplifies stakes, supporting the theme without generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the hybrid lens, from hearing the cries to actively tethering the ghosts, with cost visible in the amber's fracture. The dominant stake of hushing guilt tightens through her choices, foreclosing options and transforming the firmware, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, memory, and transformation emerge organically through events and images, such as the amber and deleted code, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the constellation memorial, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost and avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's specialized observations and rhythmic prose under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the time fold) is taught early and pays off at closure, and dialogue is minimal but natural, advancing plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "meteor hush," and sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, though minor overwriting in dense passages doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, and time folds feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in structure and concept that heightens stakes. Elements are transformed through specific details, like the amber's role, and the closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry, demonstrating authentic vision.</comment>
