<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "dirt-caked palms," "torn robes"). His final choice to accept the imperfect bird is earned by prior causality, showcasing contradictory impulses in the bitter-sweet cradling moment. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the imperfect hatching reconfigures meaning (Resonant Reconfiguration), and the causal lens holds—Aldric's actions directly lead to the outcome. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the mechanical world shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., the swaying palace and scavenged resources). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Aldric's POV, with the egg and chamber charging the final image. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) escalates through Aldric's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the imperfect hatching with unmistakable cost. The resolution forecloses a path and reweights options, driven by his vigil and choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically through events and images (e.g., the broken song), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the city's response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., time passing) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied rhythm, though minor purple tinges in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fevered brightness of mystics") slightly reduce clarity. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity (mechanical world, suspended palace), transformed through grounded character choices. The flawed genesis concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
