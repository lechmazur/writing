<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her decisive use of the clock weight. However, her competence lacks significant flaws or internal contradiction, slightly reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (town reconnection) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the community's transformation. Causality is tight, from Marta's actions to the elevators' response, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the astronomical clock tower and grain elevators constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "brass gears clicking") are integrated into action and reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening as the elevators' chorus draws the community. Cost is visible in the shared planning and wonder, though the escalation is somewhat straightforward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection and harmony emerges naturally from events and images, such as the polyglot chorus bridging silos, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the swinging weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Marta's perspective. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and any elision (e.g., language shifts) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language (e.g., "pendulum that would swing between the clock tower and the nearest elevator") is coherent and enhances momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of singing grain elevators is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in premise and structure heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation through specific detail is exceptional.</comment>
