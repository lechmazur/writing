<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ezra's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the tuning fork) rooted in her expertise. Her final renunciation—choosing to document rather than escape—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in embracing the "luminous ache." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from clock malfunction to resolution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ezra reconfigures her purpose, with cost legible in her decision to remain suspended. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of time-threads shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lunar observatory setting is indispensable, pressuring choices through tremors and cables. Sensory details (e.g., "carbon cables that hummed") are selective and POV-filtered. The clock as micro-setting constrains actions and charges the final image of time-threads anchoring the station.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (observatory stability) escalates under causal lens via Ezra's agency—using camera and tuning fork. Cost is unmistakable in her foreclosed escape path. One meaningful tightening occurs as the clock hand slows, reweighting options with visible tension in the foundations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality vs. constancy emerges through particulars like the tuning fork and time-threads, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Ezra's purpose to document "suspended between two states." Subtext operates in images (e.g., "leaf-fall song") that deepen meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., temporal eddies) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Ezra's lexicon, and rhythm modulates with crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "silver blur") is coherent and purposeful. Sentence propulsion accelerates with tension, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time manipulation and lunar setting feels inevitable. Tropes (e.g., mad clock) are transformed through specific mechanics like the camera capturing "quantum gaps." Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
