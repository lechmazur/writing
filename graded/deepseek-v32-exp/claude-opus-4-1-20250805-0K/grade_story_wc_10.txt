<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion (e.g., frozen tears) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (realizing music's secret language) and cost is legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with persistent constraint (silence) shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from experiments to insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the winterglass conservatory and plants constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states. The environment functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her experiments with tuning forks and thermal imaging deepen stakes. Cost is unmistakable in emotional weight and foreclosed paths. Dominant stake (translating silence) tightens through meaningful turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and persistence. Subtext in plant responses and Indigenous knowledge enriches without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflective of Mira's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful compression (e.g., lyrical descriptions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements in a non-obvious way, with thermal plant communication feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity and transformation of tropes demonstrate authentic vision.</comment>
