<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to transform pain into beauty is clear and consistent, driving key choices like composing lullabies and teaching arrivals. Interiority is embodied through specific actions (e.g., "cracked from disuse" voice), and earned endurance across centuries forecloses war with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, limiting depth in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the shell's enduring practice forecloses conflict with cost legible in the dissolved postcard and ongoing effort. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of transformation coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the gargantuan shell constraining choices (acoustics enabling lullabies) and charging the final image as a greenhouse for transformation. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "reef-shadow joy," enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the poet's agency—her lullabies and teachings—deepening the blossom armistice stake through increased participation. Cost is unmistakable in the centuries of work and the postcard's dissolution, narrowing options away from war.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the galaxy postcard and lullabies, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on transforming pain without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (e.g., "worn things... instruments of illumination"), and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("reef-shadow joy") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., time jumps) is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "half-sung lullabies" advancing plot and theme). No artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of armistice, photosynthesis, and cosmic patterns, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details (e.g., galaxy postcard) avoid template plots.</comment>
