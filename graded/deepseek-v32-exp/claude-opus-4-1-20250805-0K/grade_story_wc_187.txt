<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the crystal and writing with the quill. Her final realization and action are earned by prior causality, showcasing a hierarchy of values. However, minor abstraction in phrases like "preemptively nostalgic" slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost legible in the final image of survivors gathering, reconfiguring meaning under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the structure builds coherently through reflections and images. No causality breaks, but the quiet resolution may lack dramatic tension for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the observatory enabling memory preservation and the fog-stone altering tactics.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical rhythm and perceptual signature filtering details through Lyra's bias.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story through concrete images.
