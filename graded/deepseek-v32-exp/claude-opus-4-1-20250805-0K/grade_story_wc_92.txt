<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is clear and rooted in his years of vigilance, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like aligning the quill holder. However, internal conflict is minimal, and his decisiveness lacks contradictory impulses, preventing a higher score. Captain Amara adds relational pressure, but Thorne's arc is somewhat rational and tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise as the signal is set, reconfiguring options with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the sundial's persistent constraint shapes tactics. The blackout and signal alignment create coherent because/therefore linkages that tighten toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the quill holder and sundial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "polished surface reflecting the luminous fort" are purposeful and filtered through Thorne's POV. The environment pressures actions, such as using the darkened courtyard for secrecy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Thorne's agency under the causal lens, such as aligning the quill holder during the blackout. Cost is legible in the risk of discovery, narrowing options meaningfully. However, the tension relies heavily on setup rather than multiple reversals, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through particulars like the "cradle of sparks" and sundial coding, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "tending its quiet fire." Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as Amara's curved lips conveying understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in phrases like "like captured fire." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Amara's revelation about the blackout. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, as in "the cradle of sparks had been lit." Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a silent revolution via coded signals is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the half-painted sundial transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar archetypes.</comment>
