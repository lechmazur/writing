<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her legacy, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling vibrations and photographing diaries. Her final decision to add her whisper shows earned change with visible cost, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira ensures future cartographers can hear the dreams, with cost legible when she writes in the notebook. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with the film negative serving as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and walls constrict choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as navigating narrow corridors and extracting echoes from specific stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with discoveries like the film and diaries tightening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in her commitment to preserving memories, foreclosing other paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges through concrete events and images, like the walls dreaming, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, such as Mira's realization that "the burden of legacy" ensures the future hears the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, as with the film negative's revealed purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "whispered with their own peculiar acoustics," and syntax varies naturally to support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of echo cartography in a post-climate world is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like acoustic memories. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
