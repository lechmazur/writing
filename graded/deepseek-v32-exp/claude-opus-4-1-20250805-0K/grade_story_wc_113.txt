<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices (e.g., transcribing despite dismissal). His final choice to play and complete the note is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as he steps deeper into the flood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the darkness and the continued note, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the flooded space persistently constrains tactics, leading to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and lanterns create a vivid atmosphere that constrains choices (e.g., Marcus standing in water) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (unraveling the ghost's code), and escalation is driven by Marcus's agency (transcribing, playing). Cost is legible as he risks drowning to complete the note, under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of in-between spaces and completion emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the restored program, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., wordless conversation) is taught and pays off at closure, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is concise with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, transforming ghost tropes through specific details (water damage, flooded setting). Risk-taking in supernatural elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
