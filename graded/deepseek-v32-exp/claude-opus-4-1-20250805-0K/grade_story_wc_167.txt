<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like throwing stones revealing his hierarchy of values. However, the characterization lacks strong internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of ripples, reweighting the premise with felt cost from the demolition letter. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in Marcus's decision to document and teach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "condensation beaded on every pane"; the prism atrium and pool function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding value in the mundane is signaled early; escalation is driven by Marcus's agency in observing patterns, with cost legible in the loss of the atrium but gain of insight under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as ripples and light patterns; subtext operates through implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. No head-hopping, though voice is slightly ornate, it supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no major artifacts like loops or scaffold, and figurative language is purposeful without muddling clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the glazier's perspective with profound themes; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the combination feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
