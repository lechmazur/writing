<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her lukewarm magic and earnest devotion drive key choices under pressure. Internal conflict is shown through her persistence despite skepticism, and the final vindication is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her exhaustion. Embodied emotion and micro-choices, such as channeling magic into the viaduct, reveal character without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Mira's exhaustion and the ocean's restoration). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from theory to ritual success. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (viaduct as tuning fork, broken bell) shape tactics. Cost is legible at "Mira collapsed against the viaduct's railing, exhausted but vindicated."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the sapphire viaduct and broken bell constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "dew would form inside the bell at exactly three drops per minute") are selective and integrated into action. Micro-setting functions as a resource that alters tactics, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring the fish) is signaled early and escalates under causal lens via Mira's agency. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ritual progresses, narrowing options and culminating in a cost-legible success. Protagonist's alteration is earned, with no coincidence resolving conflict; cost is visible in her exhaustion and prior alienation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (precision over power, understanding over force) emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the humming bell and fishing boat. Subtext operates in implication, such as "madness and revelation often wore the same face," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mira's voice is consistent and poetic, reflecting her focus on resonance and detail. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "The third drop never fell") is taught and pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, enhancing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a prayer made of stone") is controlled and serves atmosphere. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and there are no coherence issues in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied openings and concise advancement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic imbalance and acoustic theory, transformed through specific details like dripping rates and viaduct resonance. Emotional truth arises from character-specific struggle, and risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
