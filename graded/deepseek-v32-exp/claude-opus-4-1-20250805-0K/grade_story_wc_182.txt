<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her expertise; her final choice to complete the diary is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the seekers' release. Interiority is concrete, shown through actions like marking her path and solving traps, though her emotional range is somewhat limited under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost felt in the amber cracking and seekers gasping; causal lens holds strong from research to negotiation. Orientation is immediate, and the mountain's transformation reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the circular room trap, while charging the final image of the garden. Sensory details like humming books and glowing diary are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from navigating traps to renegotiating with the mountain; cost is legible in the frozen seekers and their release.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transformation of unlearned lessons into seeds, with subtext in the mountain's negotiation; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature fitting an arcane linguist; prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, such as in the "unheard symphony" description, without head-hopping.</comment>
