<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's prosopagnosia is a consistent and driving trait, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her realization that her condition is a "different kind of sight" is earned through specific struggle, and the final choice to create the light portrait forecloses the library's physical existence with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lyra completes the portrait, reconfiguring her understanding of perception and legacy. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of light and memory build to a legible cost—the library's demolition—felt in the final image. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly specific and constrains Lyra's choices, such as using its gaps for light refraction. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her POV, charging the final image of the "sky inside walls." The setting pressures tactics and resources, essential to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled—preserving the library's essence—and escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increases in discovery and creation. Lyra's agency drives the escalation, culminating in a cost legible in the demolition's inevitability and the enduring portrait. The tightening forecloses options with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring perception and continuity without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the light portrait and coin, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the coin's map representing human connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Lyra's unique sensory world. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the coin's discovery) is taught and paid off. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring causality. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes face-blind artistry with a condemned library in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details, like the light-crafting method, anchor universals with freshness.</comment>
