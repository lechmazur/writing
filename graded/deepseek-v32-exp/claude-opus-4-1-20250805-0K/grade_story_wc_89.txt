<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied contradiction in "paradoxically steady in my uncertainty." Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, like trembling hands, reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her altered state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira becomes a bridge between worlds, with cost legible in the final moth image. Accumulative/textural lens holds, tightening through sensory density. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of love shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the Everbloom Orchard and vial of spices constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like "pearl-white blossoms" and scent permeate reality, integrated into action and transformation under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reuniting with Kess escalates under accumulative lens through Mira's agency in using the spices, leading to a metamorphosis that forecloses her human path with visible cost. Pressure coheres and tightens in the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love beyond death emerges through particulars like the fortune and moth transformation, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, with earned resonance in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with Silverwhisper is natural and goal-driven, and purposeful compression in transformation scene supports voice without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "petals becoming scales" is coherent and supports pressure, and closure image is clear without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of beast whisperer and cosmic intimacy feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like stardust cinnamon. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
