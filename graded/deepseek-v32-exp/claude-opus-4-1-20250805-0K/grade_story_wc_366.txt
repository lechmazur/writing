<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elsa's reticence and solitude are consistently embodied, with micro-choices like clutching the letter and pocketing the sea glass revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final decision to tend the light is earned by prior causality, transforming isolation into purpose with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from letters to stone message to ghostly revelation, with closure as a decisive change where Elsa takes over the lighthouse. Cost is legible in the ghosts' relief and her stacked-stone message, reconfiguring options without exposition. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or teleporting props disrupt causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the stone cairns guide Elsa's actions, the lantern room pressures the climax, and the sea glass pulses with thematic weight. Sensory details like phosphorescent foam and salt-laden air are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elsa's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent from dock to tower.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety versus loneliness escalates under causal lens through Elsa's agency: reading the stones, confronting Jonas, and igniting the lamp. Cost is unmistakable in her acceptance of solitary duty and the ghosts' weeping. One meaningful tightening forecloses her old life and redefines protection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of isolation transformed into purpose emerges organically through stones, letters, and sea glass, with subtext in gestures like the collapsed cairn. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elsa's stacking stones, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with Elsa's perceptual signature evident in her selective attention to waves and gulls. Voice is distinct and lyrical, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in Jonas's whispered revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "luminescent ache" is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without purple prose or register drift, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of haunted lighthouse trope through specific elements like stone messages and sea glass, transforming familiarity into emotional specificity. Risk-taking in supernatural elements is grounded in character logic, with turns feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold stance avoids median options.</comment>
