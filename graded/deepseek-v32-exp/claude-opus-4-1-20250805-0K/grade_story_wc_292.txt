<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like "spongey dread" transforming into "weight of inherited responsibility." Her final choice to broadcast coordinates is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance and micro-choices under stress. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara broadcasts coordinates, reconfiguring her role with felt cost under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and events are linked through because/therefore logic from discovery to action. The cost is legible in "the weight of inherited responsibility," and the storm serves as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the weather station and storm pressuring choices and the copper nail constraining actions and charging the final image. Sensory details like "hummed," "shrieking," and "brine and decay" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment evolves causally with events, supporting the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding journals to broadcasting amid the storm, with cost legible in her risk and inherited responsibility. The dominant stake of saving exiles tightens through meaningful turns, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the copper nail and reversible exile, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and responsibility without moralizing. Subtext operates in coded stanzas and Elara's realization, inviting reflection. The ending image reweights prior material with conceptual cost, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Elara's poetic observations like "spongey dread." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot. Prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, though minor register consistency might prevent a 9+. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "wet wool" is coherent and voice-motivated. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere, but slight overwriting in peak beats prevents a 9+. Clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity through the copper nail and reversible exile, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic diction and climate fiction heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and transformation avoid derivative patterns, supported by grounded character choices.</comment>
