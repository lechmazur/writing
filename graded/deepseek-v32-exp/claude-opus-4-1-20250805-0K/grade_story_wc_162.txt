<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Marina realizes her father's fate and love's necessary distance, with felt cost in the final lines.

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Marina's agency, using the logbook to navigate the maze, with turns based on weather codes narrowing options.
