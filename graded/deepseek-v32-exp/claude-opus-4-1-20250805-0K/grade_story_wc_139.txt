<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses (ease and difficulty in preparing her father's body) are embodied in scene, and her final choice to let Wei take the offerings is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her emotional resolution. Her honesty contrasts sharply with her father's deception, revealed through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Wei accepts the pot and money, and Maya buries her father, reconfigured by her realization that "everything" remains. The causal lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early and no plot breaks; the final image of cost is legible in the subtraction of sins from love.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "chemical-sweet air" and the ink pot as micro-setting that evolves meaning. The environment pressures tactics, such as Maya's embalming work mirroring thematic transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Wei's breach raises stakes, and Maya's revelations about the accounts and ashes force a trade-off with cost legible in Wei's acceptance and her emotional burden. The dominant stake of redemption tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the ink pot's reweighted meaning and the "mathematics of a fair trade," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (e.g., Wei's trembling hands) and the final image reconfigures debt and inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Maya's voice is precise and reflective, and dialogue carries subtext (e.g., Wei's "That's not enough"). Rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "cancer was just his body's way of keeping honest books") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Momentum is sustained with concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of redemption through concrete details like ashes in the ink pot and compound interest calculations, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
