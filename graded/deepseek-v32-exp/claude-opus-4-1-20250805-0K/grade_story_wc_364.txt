<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Korin's meekness is consistently embodied as a form of listening, driving his choices to descend and forge with visible cost. Interiority is concrete through scarred fingers and breath-measured strikes, though minor lack of contradictory impulses under peak pressure prevents a higher score. Final renunciation of a simple sword for an awakening blade is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when the merchant's trembling recognition revalues bartered consciousness. Accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the orchard planet's defiance of gravity. Mine shaft descent tightens options organically, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating stone arches and mine shafts constrain Korin's descent and forge work, charging the final image of cherry blossoms falling upward. Sensory details like cherry blossoms as pink snow are selective and POV-filtered. The setting actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming bartered awakenings escalates through Korin's agency in weaving silk into the blade. Cost is legible in the merchant's tremors and recalled losses. Under accumulative lens, density increases with each beat of forging, narrowing options to a single transformative tool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakenings emerges through the silk's woven dreams and the blade's purpose, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "falling isn't failure... another form of flight." Subtext operates in imagery like azure defiance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, noticing metal's memory and silk's impossible smoothness. Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the merchant's exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "colors that shouldn't exist" is purposeful and consistent. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency, especially in the forge beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of bartered awakenings is a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like dream-woven silk and levitating ore. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors the unique concept.</comment>
