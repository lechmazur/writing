<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in prophecy discovery, with embodied emotion in his performance. His final choice to silence the prophecy is earned through prior causality, but interior contradiction is subtle, lacking intense simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in permanent silence; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong through patterned silence. Orientation is clear early, and the prism atrium constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (prism atrium alters sound) and charges the final image with dewdrops as prisms. Sensory details are vivid and selective, woven into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by collective silence under the Accumulative lens, narrowing options to smother the prophecy. Cost is legible in unplayed music and lost futures, with agency in non-performance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence versus prophecy emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with rainbows as promise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., negative space) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "ghost-memories") slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of silencing prophecy through unplayed music is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with abstract concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
