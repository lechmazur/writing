<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as patiently gathering prophecy fragments. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses or deep flaws, limiting complexity; the final renunciation is earned but without intense internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost in the final image of peace through ignorance, under a hybrid causal-textural lens. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear causality from her actions to the prophecy's dispersal, and the brook's role as a persistent constraint charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly specific and constrain choices, such as using the water's murmur to swallow sound. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the POV, with the environment directly shaping the climax and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's agency under the causal lens, as she counters the prophecy's struggle and chooses dispersal, with cost legible in her solitude and the transformed haven. The dominant stake of preventing harm tightens meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the brook smoothing away destiny, offering a resonant non-literal answer about truth and ignorance. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet consistent diction, and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice reflects the summoner's solitary nature, and purposeful compression, like the prophecy fragments, enhances clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "crystallized moonlight," is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion supports the tranquil tone without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of silencing prophecies through dispersal is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet resolution. Specific details like the origami wing and brook integrate organically, avoiding tropes and enhancing stakes.</comment>
