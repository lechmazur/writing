<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the child's cast despite phantom pain. Her motivation to find purpose after trauma compels higher-stakes choices, and the final renunciation of grand peace for intimate healing is earned with visible cost. The relationship with the child acts as a crucible, forcing a stance crystallization that forecloses a path with felt emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Maya's acceptance of her role and the shared moment in the mist. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through symbolic interactions to a final image that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of Maya's injury shapes tactics without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Maya's POV. The coral evolves from a personal relic to a symbol of endurance, directly influencing the climax when given to the child. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Maya's agency in engaging with the child, deepening the stake from personal healing to communal connection. The cost is unmistakable in her physical pain and emotional burden, foreclosing other paths. A meaningful tightening occurs when she decrypts the notes, narrowing options and reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the coral and cast, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to healing through "new alphabets," avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, and the final image reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Maya's professional translator idiom and morphine-hazed observations. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, enhancing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "lotus-hearted ache," and peaks maintain clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the gathering of patients, and the final image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma, translation, and healing feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the brain coral and smudged prayers. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflective closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the perspective is memorable and authentic.</comment>
