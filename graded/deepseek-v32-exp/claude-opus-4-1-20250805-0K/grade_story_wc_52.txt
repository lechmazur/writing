<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Margaret's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values; her final renunciation (moving with grief, not on) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformed hands and decision to teach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the final image of the handless clock; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting, constraining choice via the kettle's timeframe and charging the final image with rust-hued peace; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Margaret's agency under the accumulative lens, deepening her understanding of love's persistence; cost is unmistakable in her carved clock and transformed stance, foreclosing the path of pure grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the clock face and ash wood, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing; subtext operates in images and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature blending poetic precision and practical observation; rhythmic control under pressure heightens clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the carving sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of grief, time, and craft; the clock face without hands transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
