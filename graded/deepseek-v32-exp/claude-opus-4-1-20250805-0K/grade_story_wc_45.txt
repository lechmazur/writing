<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thomas's evolution from skepticism to forgiving awareness is embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as pocketing the tooth and weaving the nest, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction—yearning for the lost sister while loving the found one—acts simultaneously in scene, earning the final endurance. The closure choice (accepting Elara's visits) is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in the "charged poise" of the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Thomas's understanding that "certainty was overrated." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, deepening through patterned imagery (bones, garden) that reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the persistent constraint of the garden shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., the bench where memories surface) and charges the final image with "impossible blooms." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "jasmine tangled with forgotten roses," weaving atmosphere into action. The environment pressures Thomas's healing practice and Elara's transitions, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Thomas's agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening through the conversation with Elara to a choice that forecloses reunion but deepens understanding. The cost is legible in his return of the tooth "for luck" and the acknowledgment that healing means transformation. Dominant stake (internal conflict and relationship) deepens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like bone setting and the garden, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing and forgiveness without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (Elara touching the fountain) and images (the woven nest). The ending reweights prior material through the realization that "understanding... could heal wounds that magic alone never could."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Thomas's lyrical yet precise observations ("light caught differently depending on the angle"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, as in Elara's "You kept it." Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the substitute body) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The bones he would set tomorrow would carry this knowledge"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; syntax varies purposefully. Momentum is maintained through concrete action and image, supporting the closure effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling lore with healing motifs feels inevitable through specific choices like bone setting as metaphor for emotional repair. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept ("cleft in certainty") transforms familiar material. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, anchored in lived detail.</comment>
