The relationship with Chen serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through patterns and images to a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly described and constrain choices, charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early with Mira's desire to find connecting threads, escalating through her collaboration with Chen and the installation's creation.

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring universal love through specifics like repeated phrases and the thrush's nest.
