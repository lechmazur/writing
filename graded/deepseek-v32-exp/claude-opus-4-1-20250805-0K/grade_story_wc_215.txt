<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her reclusive nature and culminating in an earned stasis; her final decision to preserve silence is motivated by prior causality and the cost of enduring solitude is visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative lens; the cost is legible in Mara's acceptance of her role as keeper, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the stained glass box's persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the abandoned oasis and stained glass box are tactile and integral to Mara's actions, with sensory details filtered through her POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as her realization through contextual clues deepens the stake of preserving unspoken words; the cost forecloses other paths with felt weight in the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the covenant's tangles and Mara's silence, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of unspoken words; subtext operates through images and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Mara's solitary nature; elision in ghostly communication is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density; minor rhythmic variations exist, but no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure causality or closure, and figurative language is purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic beekeeping with thematic depth feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in the quiet, lyric ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully integrated.</comment>
