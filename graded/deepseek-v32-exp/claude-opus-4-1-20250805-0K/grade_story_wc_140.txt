<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mari's motivation is clear and rooted in the death certificate error, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to sign names is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformation. Interiority is concrete, such as carrying the poison label, and internal conflict is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mari signs her mother's name, her own, and something in between, reconfiguring her identity with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of annotations escalating meaning. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "rust-streaked surfaces" and "drowned quiet." Setting is integral to pressure and tactics, filtered through Mari's POV, and micro-setting elements like the poison label add specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mari's search for meaning among the erased, escalating through her discoveries in Container 47-B, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her final signing, which forecloses paths and reweights options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through events and images like the annotations and poison label, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mari's transformation, inviting reflection with purposeful ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mari, with a distinct perceptual signature in her memory-focused filter. Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure; elision (e.g., overheard stories) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "The containers groaned as the tide turned," and figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error and collector of lost stories, transformed through specific details like the poison label and container annotations. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
