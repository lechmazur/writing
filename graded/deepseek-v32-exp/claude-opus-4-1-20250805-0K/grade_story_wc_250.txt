<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's silent guardianship and Thomas's guilt are embodied through specific actions and micro-choices, such as his hunched shoulders and her deliberate shutter movements. Thomas's internal conflict—between spoken words and acted love—is dramatized without diagnostic labels, and his realization feels earned by the causal buildup. The final emotional release carries visible cost in his tears and lighter walk, satisfying the quick test for contradictory impulses and earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Thomas's understanding and Mira's charged poise) with felt cost in Thomas's dissolved burden and tears. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through light/shadow patterns to a decisive emotional shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image of reflected stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, puddles, and shutters act as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure, enabling the light-play teachings. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like wet planks reflecting stars, filtered through POV to mirror internal states. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc, satisfying the 9+ test by altering tactics and reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Thomas's guilt over his secret) escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency in weaving light patterns, tightening the emotional pressure. The cost is legible in Thomas's breathing shift and dissolved burden, foreclosing his path of grief. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through particulars like the dental mirror and shutter patterns, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Thomas's realization that love echoes in actions—reweighting prior imagery without statement. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, and the emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is third-person omniscient with stable, poetic voice and distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "spiralingly calm"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in modulated syntax, and any elision (e.g., silent teaching) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; focalization remains coherent despite shifts between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "darkness wasn't empty but full") is coherent and purposeful, enhancing peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the emotional climax, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of silent empathy is transformed through specific, grounded choices like the dental mirror and shutter patterns, feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in wordless narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. A fresh synthesis emerges from character-driven particulars.</comment>
