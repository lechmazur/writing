<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply rooted in her blindness and unique perception, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to repair the drone is clear and intensifies with the time constraint, compelling high-stakes choices. The final choice to release the drone is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the stakes of the voyage. Minor hairline slip: no significant flaws complicate choices, but this doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal chain under a Hybrid lens (leaning Causal): the broken drone necessitates repair, leading to Maya's actions and successful deployment. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the drone guides the ship, reconfiguring Maya's role. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The time pressure tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is vividly specific and constrains choices, as Maya uses the mist for perception. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her POV, charging the final image where the mist carries the drone's sound. The setting evolves with the action, avoiding static repetition. It directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing the drone before departure—is signaled early and escalates through the announcement, tightening options under the Hybrid lens. Maya's agency in the repair drives escalation, with cost legible in the time pressure and voyage stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the escalation lacks multiple reversals, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding harmony in broken things emerges through events and Maya's dialogue, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as Maya reflects on helping others find their way. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, enriching the narrative. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Maya's focus on sound and vibration. Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with dialogue natural and goal-driven. Minor convergence in emotional peaks with Chen, but no head-hopping or register drift. Elision in sensory description is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no loops or artifacts in peak beats. Sentences propel momentum, and the final image is clear. Read-aloud test passes with elegance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a blind artisan using mist for perception is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar tropes. Specific details like the hummingbird drone and repair method feel organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in sensory focus heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
