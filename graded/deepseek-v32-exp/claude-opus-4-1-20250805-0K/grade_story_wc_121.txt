<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to integrate her fractured selves is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the rune) revealing hierarchy of values. The final choice to collapse/unite is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in merging selves and losing the tablet. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kira merges her selves and touches down, reconfiguring her relationship with gravity; cost is legible in the tablet crumbling and viaduct fading. Inferred Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds, with procedural generation and fractures shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through the choice to press the rune.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct setting constrains choices through procedural generation based on fears/desires, charging the final image as it fades. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., bioluminescent moss pulsing, glow shifting), filtered through Kira's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Hybrid lens is driven by Kira's agency, with procedural generation stuttering and fragmentation increasing pressure until she presses the rune. Cost is unmistakable in merging selves and foreclosing other timelines. Dominant stake (conquering the labyrinth of self) is signaled early and tightens through a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-integration emerges through events and imagery (e.g., fractured timelines, darkening brightness), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of working with gravity. Subtext operates in implication, and earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and introspective, reflecting Kira's fragmented state through controlled syntax and rhythm. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "between the drop and the ripple") is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with rhythmic variety and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "darkening brightness"), avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere efficiently, with strong verbs and specific nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of fractured timelines, procedural generation, and gravity defiance, transformed via specific character choices and emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to implications.</comment>
