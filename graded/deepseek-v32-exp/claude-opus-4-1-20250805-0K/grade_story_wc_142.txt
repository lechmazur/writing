<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concretely embodied through actions like pressing the stone chip, and her dual allegiance creates credible internal conflict; her final choice to reorganize is earned by prior causality and visible cost, though her competence slightly reduces struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the community incorporates, under a causal lens that holds from inciting incident to resolution; cost is legible in the reorganization effort and the charged poise of "STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE."</comment>
