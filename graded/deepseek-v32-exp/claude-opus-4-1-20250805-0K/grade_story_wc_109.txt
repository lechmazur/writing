<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn with clear obsessive motivation and embodied emotion, but lacks on-page internal contradiction or complex emotional layers under pressure, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under accumulative lens; cost of patience is legible in "she smiled, knowing she had time yet"; orientation and causality remain solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and objects (fort, booklet) constrain choices and charge the final image with vivid, purposeful sensory detail; environment mirrors internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's perceptual agency under accumulative lens; cost of ongoing vigil is clear, but escalation lacks multiple distinct pressure points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mapping absence emerges organically from concrete particulars; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control enhances accumulative texture, and elision (e.g., "Listen" whisper) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes obsession with philosophical quest in a non-obvious way; risk in quiet, lyric resolution pays off with inevitability and freshness.</comment>
