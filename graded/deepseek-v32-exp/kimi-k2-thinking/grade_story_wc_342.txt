<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's face-blindness and artistic drive are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trembling hands when opening the safe) revealing his hierarchy of values. His final renunciation—letting the sky fade—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the demolition. The coin's use as a tactile map deepens his interiority without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that "some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them" reweights the premise with undeniable cost (the library's loss). Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern density intensifies through fractal imagery, and the dawn deadline coerces stance crystallization without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (demolition forcing Kael's mural) and charges the final image ("fractal dust that once was a library"). Sensory details (scent of old paper, cracks in bark) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché while mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the library through art) escalates under Accumulative pressure via time's "narrow corridor," forcing Kael's agency in painting the sky. Cost is legible when the walls "flicker" as the building falls, narrowing options and foreclosing the path with tangible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the coin's indentations and fractal brushstrokes embody the core concept of limits, culminating in a non-literal answer at closure ("the sky inside now lived inside him"). Subtext operates through images like the "hollowed heart" oak, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Kael's touch-based perception ("feeling the geometry of a smile") filters narration. Poetic compression ("the air itself seemed to hold its breath") is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "the pattern grew fractally precise, branching outward like lightning"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of face-blind artist, fractal precision, and tree-library setting feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming the trope of artistic limitation through specific, irreplaceable elements like the coin's tactile map.</comment>
