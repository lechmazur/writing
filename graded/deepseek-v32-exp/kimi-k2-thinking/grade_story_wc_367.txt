<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in consistent traits; the Herald's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to guide the ship is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her "shadowed elation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (ship rescue, storm abating) and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without contradiction, with the persistent constraint of ancient shadows shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the emerald lighthouse and glass wick constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting the Herald's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from routine to desperate signal to active steering; cost is legible in the relief and thrill, and stakes tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in shadows and laughter; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the dawn image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of prophetic power and lighthouse lore, with risk-taking in lyrical style; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
