<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., the worry stone's warmth) and micro-choices that reveal his values. The final renunciation—releasing the stone—is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in his departure. However, minor lack of overt internal contradiction in peak beats slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael releases the stone, transforming the covenant with felt cost ("footprints already erased"). The accumulative lens holds, with magnetic pulses and silence patterns driving the decision. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and worry stone constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., "lodestone gravel," "humming ground"). Setting is filtered through Kael's POV, subtly mirroring internal states and guiding his actions without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, as correlating pulses with memories tightens the stake of the eclipsed covenant. The cost is legible in his deliberate absence, foreclosing a path with visible trade-offs. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—sacrifice, silence, transformation—without moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the stone. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding abstraction. The "difficult beauty" concept is integrated through events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Kael's precise, chess-trained mind. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., silence translation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats; figurative language serves purpose (e.g., "black bishop taking its square"). Rhythm supports scene needs without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy, magnetic phenomena, and emotional exile feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., silence as dialogue). Bold choices heighten stakes without gimmickry, though the premise has familiar echoes.</comment>
