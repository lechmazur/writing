<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand time slowing is clear and drives his actions, with embodied contradictions like "serene anger" and micro-choices such as spilling ink on the drone. His final decision to continue experimenting is earned by the loss of the drone, with visible cost. However, the trait "consciously wild" is more stated than shown constraining specific choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Kael's determined quest, felt cost in the drone's loss and "unanswered question." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterns of ink and time, with orientation clear early. The persistent constraint of time slowing shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the wind-carved encampment and dunes filtering through Kael's POV. The ink vial and drone as micro-setting objects constrain choices and charge the final image. Selective details like "stone walls etched by centuries of gusts" integrate with action, though the encampment itself doesn't directly pressure tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time slowing) escalates through Kael's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the drone's disappearance tightening options and incurring cost. The decision to continue experimenting deepens the stake, but escalation is somewhat quiet, relying on density rather than dramatic turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality and time perception emerges organically through images like disappearing ink and the vanished drone, with subtext in "chasing the ephemeral." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Kael's serene anger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as Kael's albino eyes noticing "subtle distortion." Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue, and purposeful compression in reflection is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "drink the returning light" is purposeful and clear, though minor overwriting in phrases like "conscious wildness surged" slightly reduces peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of albino tracker, disappearing ink, and drone feels inevitable, transforming tropes through psychological depth. Risk-taking in quiet, introspective narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is fully committed with specific, irreplaceable elements.</comment>
