<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wick's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like following the riddle. His internal conflict between retirement and connection is earned, and the final renunciation of body-finding for emotional closeness has visible cost. However, the emotional resolution leans slightly tidy, with minimal genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent linkages from the cylinder discovery to the vault journey. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Wick reconnects with Maya's memory, foreclosing his search with felt cost in the final image of him curled among the cylinders. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the scrapyard wasteland constraining choices (e.g., Wick navigates by scent and finds resources) and charging the final vault image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Wick's POV, avoiding generic description. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on Wick's internal conflict between isolation and connection, escalating through his agency under the causal lens (e.g., journeying based on the riddle). Cost is legible in the wasteland hardships and emotional toll, narrowing options to a decisive closure. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges through particulars like the leaf and cylinders, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the vault discovery, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Wick's senses. Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "like reading Braille with his eardrums"). No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting in phrases like "tinted revelations" is negligible and doesn't harm clarity or closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes with a bloodhound protagonist and phonograph messages feels inevitable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and transformation of familiar elements through grounded details avoid derivative premises.</comment>
