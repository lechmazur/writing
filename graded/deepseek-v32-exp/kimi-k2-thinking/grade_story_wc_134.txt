<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to magnify magic is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion in clutching the pearl. Her final choice to accept the forces is earned by prior causality, showing micro-choices under pressure. However, her initial passivity and lack of strong contradictory impulses slightly limit depth, though cost is visible at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Lira opens her hands, allowing forces to inhabit the pearl, reconfiguring balance under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The pearl's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the cave's steadied rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Specificity in crystal pillars and shadows pressures Lira's decisions, and the environment evolves causally. Micro-setting elements like the pearl alter tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, as the pearl's pulsing and her decision to become a vessel tighten stakes. Cost is legible in the surrender and new unpredictability. One meaningful deepening occurs, though no multiple reversals, aligning with scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges from events, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the pearl's new magic. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and elision is taught early. No head-hopping or register shifts, and voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, enhancing atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure clarity is untouched by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of clairvoyant, crystal cave, and unseen forces, transforming tropes through specific details. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in tone and structure. However, it lacks a highly non-obvious twist, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
