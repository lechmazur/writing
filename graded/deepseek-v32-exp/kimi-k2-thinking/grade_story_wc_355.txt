<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's pacifism and cataloguing motive are consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., steady hands during radio tuning). Final diary opening is earned, but minor telliness in emotional summary ("heart raced") slightly reduces embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (diary opening reweights empathy concept) with felt cost in Mira's realization. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality links tuning frequencies to unlock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workshop and stars setting constrains choice (radio and diary as tools) and charges the final image of shared stillness. Sensory details (e.g., "shadows pooled like ink") are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: tuning frequencies narrows options to unlock diary, with cost in emotional breakthrough ("true explosion was the opening of empathy"). Agency drives deepening, but one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as empathy emerges through particulars (diary clasp, radio static) without moralizing; ending offers non-literal answer ("silence is the shape of love") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, silence-focused prose). Rhythm controls pressure peaks; elision (e.g., frequency tuning mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silence that held its breath") but no muddle or loops. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of tuning silence for empathy is a fresh synthesis; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight through character choices.</comment>
