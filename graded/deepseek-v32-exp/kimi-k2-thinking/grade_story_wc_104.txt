<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied actions like "his mind a calm ocean." However, interiority lacks contradiction, leaning toward single-note determination without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as seeds are planted and chains become a "ladder," cost felt in decay. Accumulative lens holds, but the sentry confrontation is briefly summarized, slightly reducing causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices: the piano bench and arrow constrain decoding, and the carnival's decay charges the final image. Sensory details like "stale popcorn and decay" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under accumulative lens: decoding keys, impeding sentry, and planting seeds each tighten stakes. Cost is legible in the "dry, cracked earth" and the liberator's chained triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through concrete actions and images like seeds as "green rebellion," without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the soil "welcoming new life."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "his mind a calm ocean." Poetic voice remains consistent under pressure, though no dialogue tests naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with clear propulsion, e.g., "each press a whisper of possibility." No loops or artifacts; figurative language supports without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of decay and hope feels inevitable, with risk in poetic tone. The seed vault and chain transformation are specific and non-obvious, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
