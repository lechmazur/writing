<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caleb's reticence and warmth are consistently embodied through micro-choices like bottling the sea glass, with interior contradiction in his comfort and unease around the ghost. His motivation to protect the lighthouse deepens under pressure, and the final endurance of "luminescent ache" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing ease with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Caleb relights the lamp and continues the chain, with cost legible in "luminescent ache" and the ghost's satisfied fade. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lamp failure incites a coherent tightening that pays off in the bottled safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "salt crust on the lantern glass" and "briny air," and the haunted lantern room as micro-setting pressures Caleb's choice to bottle the sea glass. The sea glass and cairn recur to charge the final image of "safety bottled," constraining tactics and enriching atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the lighthouse's promise escalates under accumulative lens through the lamp failure and ghost's urgency, driving Caleb's agency to relight the lamp and bottle the feeling. Cost is unmistakable in the "luminescent ache" that settles in his bones, narrowing options toward enduring duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of safety and loneliness emerges organically through the sea glass, anonymous letters, and ghost, with subtext in the "bottled" feeling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the new stone and continued vow, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply focalized through Caleb's perceptual signature, with lyrical rhythm control under pressure ("luminescent ache of the night settle into his bones"). No head-hopping; elision like the ghost's origin is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "glowing faintly in the dark" serves pressure without muddle, and closure image is clear. Minor overwriting in "luminescent ache" repetition is harmless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse keeper, ghost, and anonymous letters feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet atmosphere. Specific details like the cairn messaging transform tropes, and the sea glass's reprise charges closure with authenticity.</comment>
