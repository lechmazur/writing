<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in his "translucent smile." The actress is less developed, but her renewal is earned through the ghost's agency. Minor slip in her internal conflict, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the ghost's fulfilled purpose and the mending timeline, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through echo production and intertwining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "petals that chimed like glass bells" are selective and purposeful. The orchard setting constrains choices and charges the final image, integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the shared encore. Stakes tighten meaningfully, though the actress's side lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibility and nostalgia emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shared anthem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid imagery and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, synesthesia, and fractured timelines feels inevitable. Risk-taking in blending elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
