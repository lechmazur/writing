<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her background, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "clover-melancholy." Her final choice to teach probability is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her promise to her father's ghost. Contradictory impulses between logic and superstition act in scene, such as when she feels thrill in decoding gambler's scrawls with academic rigor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Lila realizes chance and certainty coexist, with cost legible in her whispered promise. Causal lens holds strong from father's death to discovery of hidden room. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the map alignment from subway to library alcove creates a coherent, earned turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Settings like the rainwashed library and subway are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "scent of old pages mingled with clover-melancholy"). The lantern as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as its mica pane guides the map discovery. Spatial choreography is clean during the traversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling randomness with certainty escalates under causal lens through Lila's agency in decoding scrawls and finding the hidden room. Cost is legible in her foreclosed path of reckless betting, replaced by responsible teaching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map points to the alcove, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of chance versus logic emerges organically from events like decoding Markov chains, with subtext in images like the lantern. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "language of existence" realization, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the lantern as a "heart that had learned to beat in two worlds" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., noticing probability ratios in scrawls. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision in code interpretation is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in phrases like "clover-melancholy" is voice-motivated and not detrimental. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., lantern "glow faintly" responding to scrawls, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of probability theory and personal quest feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like Markov chains in graffiti. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise offers a fresh angle on legacy and reconciliation, with authenticity in Lila's academic and emotional arc.</comment>
