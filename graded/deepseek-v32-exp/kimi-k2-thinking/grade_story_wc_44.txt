<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions; her quiet deliberateness is shown through precise tracing of runes, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page with shadows sealed and cost felt in the effort and averted threat; orientation is anchored early.</comment>
