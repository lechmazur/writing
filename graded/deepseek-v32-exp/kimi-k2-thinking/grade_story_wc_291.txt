<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and methodical nature are deeply integrated with her actions and emotional arc. Her motivation to awaken empathy is clear and evolves through micro-choices, such as touching the ribbon, which reveals embodied conflict and earns the final change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Elara's empathy awakens and the case is solved—under a causal lens that holds throughout. The persistent constraint of her face blindness shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The quarry setting constrains choices (e.g., the ribbon snagged in a fissure) and charges the final image, with sensory details like mist and limestone walls filtered through Elara's POV to create purposeful atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency, from finding the ribbon to painting the portrait, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The cost is legible in her emotional shift from "cold arithmetic" to warmth, foreclosing her apathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Themes of blindness vs. sight and method vs. emotion emerge through particulars like the painting process, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as empathy reconfigures prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elara's focus on geometries and ratios. Rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the frantic painting scene, maintains clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "geometries of grief" is character-consistent, and sentence rhythm varies naturally to support emotional beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The face-blind artist concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure integrates originality with emotional truth.</comment>
