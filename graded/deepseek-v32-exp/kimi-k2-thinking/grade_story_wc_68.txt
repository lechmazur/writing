<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Malach's rationally rebellious nature is consistently embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as filing the cog despite patrols, with his final act of encoding data earned by prior causality and visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The closure choice forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost when the patrol passes without violence, reconfiguring meaning under a causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of Council pressure shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in Malach's calm defiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "phosphorescent fungus lamp" and "sediment layers" filtered through POV. The sewer environment pressures Malach's actions, and the cog as a micro-setting object is indispensable. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with the patrol's arrival tightening pressure and Malach's filing representing a decisive choice with unmistakable cost. The dominant stake of truth preservation is signaled early and deepens through the climax, foreclosing options with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the cog encoding "the calculus of collapse," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth versus mythology. Subtext operates in gestures like Malach's calm filing, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a philosophical perceptual signature reflected in rhythmic prose like "method endured in metal and mud." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, with diction consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and character, as in "His rebellion was rational: evidence over elegy," with clarity and concision. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic archaeology and philosophical rebellion, transformed through specific details like stratigraphic maps. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
