<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final renunciation and Marcus's change are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his raw voice and request to learn. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her screaming tenderness held behind teeth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page in Marcus's whispered request. The accumulative/textural lens holds, tightening through sensory density and emotional layers. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details (cool salt air, warm walls) filtered through POV. Micro-setting elements like the cork and lens are integral to action and theme, altering tactics and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communication vs. silence escalates under the accumulative lens through Elara's agency with the cork, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in Marcus's cracked voice and trembling touch, foreclosing his shouting path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of communication through whispers and intentions emerges coherently from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer with silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, with elision taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion. No overwriting or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse lore with vibrational intent feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully integrated with character and closure.</comment>
