Her jocular tone masks deeper seriousness, showing internal contradiction. The final renunciation—leaving the moon rock—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where shared memories transform loneliness into hope, with felt cost in Mira's departure and Elara's ongoing care.

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is vividly described and constrains choices, serving as the stage for the rumor chain and final act.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loneliness cured through reciprocity emerges from events and images, not direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but natural. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
