<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to salvage pure memory is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions, though internal conflict could be more pronounced. The final choice to help Elias is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his peaceful dissipation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (Elias's dissipation and the lullaby's echo), under the accumulative/textural lens. Causality from dream analysis to the hidden compartment is coherent, and orientation is clear early. The final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and wreckage are vivid, sensory-rich settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Specific details like the ice walls and snow globes are integrated into action, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging pure memory) is signaled early and escalates through Maya's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible when Elias dissipates, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection and memory emerges through images and events, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the snow globes and lullaby, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., dream mechanics) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts obscure causality; figurative language like "borrowed starlight" enhances momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving and ghost-whispering feels fresh and inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not fully unparalleled.</comment>
