<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final renunciation (releasing the swan) is earned by prior causality, though some passivity reduces agency. The trait "grips reality loosely" is concretely demonstrated in her wandering and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she accepts decay, with cost felt in the release of the swan and the "crumbling peace." Orientation is clear early, and the origami swan's role is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "moss-covered spines," "silence pooled like water") filtering through POV. The library's decay constrains choices, forcing the burrow action, and charges the final image of quiet perseverance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving knowledge escalate under accumulative lens through density increases (e.g., decay pressing in). Agency in using the swan and realizing her role drives deepening, with cost legible in the swan's release and acceptance of decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing without judgment emerges organically through images and events, such as the swan's folds and regenerative silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the released swan, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "letting the world's edges blur"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., cryptic folds) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in figurative language does not harm clarity; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Rhythm supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (chronicle keeper, origami swan, regenerative silence) feels inevitable and organic. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
