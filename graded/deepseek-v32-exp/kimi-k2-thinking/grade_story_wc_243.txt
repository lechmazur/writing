<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The archivist's resolve to regenerate the covenant is earned through prior causality, and her emotional progression feels realistic with contradictory impulses. However, minor summarization in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the jetty becoming a threshold of renewal and cost legible in the community's response. The structure is coherent with a clear inciting incident (locket discovery) leading to a meaningful deepening. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like cedar shelf and night-blooming jasmine filtering through the archivist's POV. The blooming jetty constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as a micro-setting that alters tactics and reinforces theme. Economy of detail maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by the archivist's agency, with her journey to the jetty and writing act deepening stakes. Cost is legible in her haunted euphoria and the community's tokens, narrowing options emotionally. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the proximate cause method is underutilized in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the locket and walnut ink, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to renewal and memory, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the preserved journal, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet controlled prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and paid off. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (archivist, covenant, jetty) feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and authenticity of vision are strong, though some concepts are slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
