<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal values; the transformation from vagrant to conduit is earned through prior causality, and the cost of "a new kind of poverty" is felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong from start to closure; orientation is anchored early, and the conceptual repricing at the end—where she becomes "rooted in the invisible architecture of sound"—lands with undeniable cost, reshaping her role and the narrative's stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity, and the feral loft and glass jars function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; details like "walls breathed sand and memory" are filtered through POV and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes around redemption escalate through protagonist's agency in capturing and sharing sounds; under the accumulative lens, density increases with each jar, and the cost is legible in the "weight of captured sound" that redefines her poverty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translation between generations emerges organically from images and actions, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the symphony of jars, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic voice is distinct and stable, with a perceptual signature focused on sound and memory; POV control is consistent, and diction enhances lyrical rhythm without obscuring clarity, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied syntax and rhythm; no significant loops or artifacts, and figurative language like "droplets of pure, singable light" supports narrative propulsion without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept of capturing sounds in jars is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in the premise pays off with emotional specificity, transforming the trope of redemption through grounded, idiosyncratic detail.</comment>
