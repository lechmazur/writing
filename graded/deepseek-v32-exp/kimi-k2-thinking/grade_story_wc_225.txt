<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is clear and rooted in past guilt, driving his actions with embodied emotion. His internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the tapestry, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to teach the girl is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his "quiet storm of fierce repose."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages from decoding the tapestry to freeing the village. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the tutor's emotional weight and the village's release. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of past sacrifice shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "clocks halted" and "shimmering tapestry" filtering through the tutor's POV. The tapestry constrains choices and charges the final image, while the frozen village pressures decisions. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal redemption and freeing the village is signaled early and escalates through the tutor's agency in winnowing threads. Cost is legible in his "fierce repose" and the village's release. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shared silence and mended heart, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like accepting the pawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "fingers trained to dance across a chessboard." Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "clung to his conscience like a stubborn shadow" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes chess and magical realism with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
