<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sketching constellations, aligning compass) earning the final decision to explore. Motivation intensifies from the glimpse, compelling higher-stakes action. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; change is credible with felt cost of leaving the station.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of drifting into the void. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to the decisive act. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: time dilation affects escape timing, and the observation deck's rotation enables the window. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "starlight," "groaned open"), filtered through POV. Recurring compass rose object deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: the glimpse ignites urgency, leading to the decision to leave. Dominant stake (survival vs. exploration) tightens with visible cost (abandoning the station). No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory, direction, and exploration are woven through sketching and the compass rose, culminating in a non-literal answer at closure. No moralizing; subtext operates in silence and image, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, with syntax modulating to reflect stretched time. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., time dilation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dilating like a drop of ink"). Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build; no clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of solitude in space with time dilation and compass motif feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., sketching as map). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure is legible and charged.</comment>
