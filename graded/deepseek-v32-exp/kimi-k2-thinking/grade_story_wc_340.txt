<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through the diary revelation. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing character. The final understanding is earned with visible cost, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Kai's settled detachment. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with the elevator ascent and diary decryption creating coherent linkage. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details (fractured light, cold) filtered through Kai's POV. Environment actively shapes tactics via the optical decryption method, integrating seamlessly into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking understanding beneath anguish) escalates under the accumulative lens through diary revelations, driven by Kai's agency. Cost is legible in the emotional trade-off at closure, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the diary entries and light imagery—offering a non-literal answer on finding joy in service. Subtext operates through implication in the captain's words, resisting moralizing and earning resonance through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Kai's observations. Voice is controlled and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the diary's shifting script) taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sun scattered in every crystal") is coherent and voice-motivated, with syntactic variety supporting rhythm. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—optical decryption, servant's perspective, ice setting—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail and emotional truth.</comment>
