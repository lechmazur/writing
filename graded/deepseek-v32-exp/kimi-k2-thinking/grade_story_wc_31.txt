<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and drives the narrative; his internal journey is embodied through sensory details and micro-choices, culminating in an earned epiphany about silence with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently; closure is a conceptual repricing where Elias's realization about silence reweights his understanding with felt cost, anchored in the key tag's pulse and the library's vows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library and lantern release create a vivid atmosphere that constrains choice (e.g., accessing the logbook) and charges the final image of silence as a color, with sensory details filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, as his exploration and the key tag's significance deepen stakes; cost is legible in his transformed perception of sound and silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through imagery and action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on silence and light without moralizing; subtext in vows and keys enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic, synesthetic perception consistent throughout; rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied syntax, though minor overwriting in figurative language doesn't harm clarity; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, lamplighter, and sunken library feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting closure.</comment>
