<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "wept in colors" and micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the gear and shifting sonar pinging. The final endurance of the cycle is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in carrying eight lifetimes of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with Elara in the nebula garden. Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she accepts the eternal cycle, with cost legible in "she now carried eight lifetimes of grief." The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the generational pattern shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "chromatic mist" and "phosphorescent pollen" integrated into action. The nebula garden constrains choice as a Turing machine, affecting sonar pinging and charging the final image. Specificity reflects POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, such as touching the gear and shifting sonar frequency. Cost is legible in the eternal repetition and grief. One meaningful tightening occurs as she realizes the garden's computational nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of generational patterns and light without fire emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the cycle continuing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in petals and gears, with earned insights from struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression, like "the garden was calculating," is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and the final image resonates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of stardust Turing machine and generational patterns, transformed through specific details. Emotional truth in grief and acceptance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with a fresh, non-obvious angle.</comment>
