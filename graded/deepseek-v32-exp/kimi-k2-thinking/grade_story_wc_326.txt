<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as counting heartbeats. The final realization that the ghost mirrors her survival is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as she understands the error as a crack that lets her see truth, with felt cost in the final image. Inferred hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds without contradiction; orientation is clear early. Defragmentation action and shard use create coherent linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the opal observatory and snow creating atmosphere that pressures choices. The porcelain shard and server room constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking wisdom and personal survival escalates under the hybrid lens through defragmentation and realization. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost legible in the closure. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge, but escalation is slightly less intense than top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of failure as a map emerges from events and images like the ink patterns and shard, without direct statement. Subtext operates in implication; earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. Purposeful elision in patterns is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect character's mind state consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density with clear propulsion; rhythm varies naturally without artifacts. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, synthesizing clerical death and digital ghost with specific details. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices; risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
