<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in lines like "Lyra's heart, too, felt the crack of the bamboo." However, internal contradiction is subtle, and the final endurance feels earned but lacks deep impulsive conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lyra accepts the loneliness of preservation, with cost legible in "the weight of foxglove regret." Accumulative lens holds strong through pattern buildup, and the cracked bamboo tube shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "petals that shimmered like frozen tears" create a cohesive atmosphere. The wind chime bamboo tube constrains choice and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lyra's agency in humming the song, lighting orchids but revealing emptiness, with cost unmistakable in "hollow halls." Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though escalation is gradual without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and fragility emerges organically from images like the cracked bamboo, with subtext in "beauty often lives in imperfection." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose like "each note a thread of light." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors like "frozen tears" and "foxglove regret." No major artifacts or loops; propulsion remains clear, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like the museum of extinct feelings feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric mode that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals.</comment>
