<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with methodical hope. Interiority is concrete, shown through his insomnia and cataloging, but lacks deep internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices. Mira's reaction validates his belief, but her brief appearance limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing where lost languages live through kindness, cost legible in Kael's persistence and the ripple effect. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early. Structure is coherent, though the transition to Mira feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city constraining Kael's actions and charging the final image. Sensory details like "soft amber haze" and "pale saffron quiet" are selective and enhance atmosphere, micro-setting elements like the brush actively shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness can be remembered) escalates through Kael's painting and Mira's response, leading to a ripple effect. Agency is clear under the accumulative lens, with cost in Kael's insomnia and effort. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's act validates his work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the mural and herbs, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Mira's gratitude, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of lost languages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "moonlit daydreams." Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., Li Wei's vanishing) is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and high information density, though occasional phrases like "saffron quiet" risk slight overwriting. No major artifacts or loops; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is original, synthesizing insomniac painter, moon-tipped brush, and lost languages into a non-obvious angle on kindness. Transformation through specific details like crushed starlight ink feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
