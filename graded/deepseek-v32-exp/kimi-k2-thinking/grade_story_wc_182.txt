<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like deciphering the diary and renegotiating the pact. However, internal conflict and flaws are underdeveloped, with competence overshadowing struggle; the final change is earned but lacks deep cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal plot linkages are strong, with clear orientation and a resonant closure featuring the audible symphony. The cost of renegotiation is implicit but not heavily emphasized, preventing higher marks despite solid structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore and catacombs are vividly detailed and constrain choices, such as the labyrinth guiding navigation. The setting charges the final image with the mosaic ceiling, but is capped due to global gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes around rescue and knowledge are clear, with escalation driven by Elara's agency in deciphering gaps and facing the warden. However, the cost remains implied rather than unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of gaps as bridges emerges organically through the diary and library, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in listening to silence. Avoids moralizing, but abstraction slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic consistency in the "unheard symphony" motif. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts harming closure. Figurative language supports pressure, but the score is capped due to global gate requirements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes fresh elements like the stone warden and library of unlearned lessons, transforming tropes with specificity. Ingenuity is evident in the cipher resolution, but capped due to global gate.</comment>
