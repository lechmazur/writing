<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and internal conflict driving credible choices; her mournful eagerness compels higher-stakes actions, and the final release is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Eleanor thinning, Sarah laughing); the hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds strong, and the pull cord handle acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics; orientation is clear early without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel and pull cord handle function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eleanor's POV to amplify atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening as she adjusts her grip to avoid overwhelming Sarah; cost is legible in the spectral effort and emotional thawing, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of haunting as healing emerges organically through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of thawing grief, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional pressure without head-hopping; elision (e.g., death details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes grief and supernatural tending with a fresh, non-obvious angle; specific details like the leaf blower symphony and off-key wind transform tropes organically, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
