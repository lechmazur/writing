<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from cautious hope to determined action. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like pressing headphones tighter and sleepless nights. Her final choice to broadcast the counter-frequency is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in equipment risks and censure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hope versus naivety, under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the counter-signal fractures the tricksters' influence, cooling hysteria. Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action, with orientation anchored early. Persistent constraints like the station's ancient equipment shape tactics. Cost is legible in the risks to the transmitter and the immediate effect on the community.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like peeling paint and smells of coffee and ozone. The radio booth and astronomical charts function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image as "protective sigils." Environment pressures tactics, such as using the transmitter for the counter-frequency, and details are filtered through Mara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing cosmic manipulation of community division—escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency. Key tightening occurs when she times the counter-signal during peak protests, foreclosing the tricksters' influence with cost in equipment risks. Pressure coheres from power plays to the climax, driven by her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope versus paranoia emerges organically from events, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the tricksters feeding on division. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's enduring hope and the image of "beating back the dark," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's scientific yet gritty voice. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as when Dr. Chen storms in. Prose rhythm controls pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "cosmic gaslighting." No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance story efficiently. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle, and the final image resonates with concise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of first contact and psychological manipulation, transformed through specific details like subsonic frequencies and university politics. Risk-taking in the cosmic stakes heightens coherence, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
