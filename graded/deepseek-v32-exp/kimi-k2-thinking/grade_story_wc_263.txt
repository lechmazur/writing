<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives key choices, with embodied emotion in the frozen landscape and rest. The final renewal is earned through prior causality, though some interiority leans abstract. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, such as tracing stars to seek rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the silence enfolding her and the dawn turning the aurora pale. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the journey tightens toward the archway's revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the sextant's use on ice and the aurora's archway pressure tactics. Sensory details (silken shadows, violet fire) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: density increases through tracing stars and resting, with agency driving each beat. Cost is visible in the silence matching her heart and the foreclosed path of blocked creativity, leading to renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through stardust whispers and the archway's glow, offering a non-literal answer to creativity's source. No moralizing; the final image of swirling starlight on the page reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, cosmos-attuned voice that modulates under pressure (e.g., "unspoken words became a lullaby"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., journey ellipsis) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor repetition ("shadowed rapture" appears twice) slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant, aurora, and stardust feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (e.g., polished sextant's ghost light) avoids template plots.</comment>
