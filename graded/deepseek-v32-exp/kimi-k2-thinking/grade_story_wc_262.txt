<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation—carrying the stored love—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weeping and map settlement. The spatially imaginative trait consistently shapes actions, though internal conflict is minimal but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Mira's realization reconfiguring the theater's purpose and her role as guardian. Cost is legible in "Mira wept as map settled into skin," and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres through patterned escalation to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the projection booth and theater architecture pressure Mira's actions and embody the theme. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with spatial choreography clean. The environment's role in storing love makes it irreplaceable, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the incubation action deepening stakes and leading to a revelation that forecloses options. Cost is visible in her physical transformation and weeping, and the dominant stake (finding stored love) tightens meaningfully. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in gestures like the film strip dissolving into a map. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to where unused love is stored, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Mira's spatially imaginative mind. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., "hushed thunder") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving atmosphere without muddle. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "geometries of emotion") slightly reduces clarity, but no loops or artifacts harm closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of elements, transforming tropes through specific details like psychometry and crystal gazing. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional truth anchors originality, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
