<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's disenchantment is concretely embodied and drives her climb; her final renunciation is earned by the vision and reflection on hollow court life, with visible cost in fading memories. Interiority remains specific under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing. The choice to become guardian forecloses her path with felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("memories were already fading"); the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to the revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the mountain's curse persistently shapes tactics. The final image reweights the dream mystery with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (the climb, grotto's heat) and charges the final image; sensory details like "frost etching lacy menace" are selective and POV-filtered. The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight are integral to stakes and closure, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the queen's agency under the accumulative lens, from climb to vision; cost is legible in her surrender of throne and identity. The dominant stake (unraveling dreams vs. loss) tightens meaningfully, and her decision forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in "bleeding starlight" and the final reconfiguration; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The queen's arc integrates sacrifice and identity, inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical rhythm and perceptual signature ("thorns that grew upward"). Elision is purposeful, and diction remains within the queen's lexicon under stress. No head-hopping; experimental elements are taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but minor overwriting risks in dense figurative language (e.g., "silver wounds like bleeding starlight") without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion is maintained, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of quest and transformation tropes through specific details; the non-obvious twist ("never the dreamer, but the dreamed") feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and conceptual integrity is maintained.</comment>
