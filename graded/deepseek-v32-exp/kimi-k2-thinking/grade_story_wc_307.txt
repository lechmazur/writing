<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses (vanishing to appear) are embodied in scene, and her final choice to vanish is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, some abstraction in "delayed revelation" slightly reduces concrete interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Mira embraces vanishing, cost legible in her dissolution; accumulative/textural lens holds via pattern buildup. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (backward aging) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (platform, grotto) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the grotto's magnetic pulse and pond ripples shaping Mira's actions and revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency (e.g., casting pebble, stepping into water), tightening stakes toward vanishing; cost is unmistakable in her disappearance, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing to appear emerges through images and actions, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via Mira's dissolution, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold, figurative language coheres in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and syntax supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of backward-aging and vanishing paradox; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
