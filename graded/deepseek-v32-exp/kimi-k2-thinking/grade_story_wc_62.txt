<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to discover collective grief is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. His interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as tracing patterns and unrolling ribbons, revealing character under pressure. The final choice to carve a spiral is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the thundering calm and villagers' recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, building through patterns and images to a resonant reconfiguration closure. Kael's realization that grief is woven lands with cost in the silence and stone-touching, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ancient greenhouse constraining choices and charging the final image through elements like the ribbon roll and corpse flower. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as stone dust on orchid leaves, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes in discovering collective grief escalate through Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening as he retraces paths and maps the greenhouse. Cost is legible in the carved spiral and the villagers' recognition, foreclosing earlier options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as a spiral and woven thing emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like the ribbon handling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the spiral stone, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Kael, with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent, and any elision (e.g., ghost appearances) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "orange wings flickering like candle flames," is purposeful and coherent, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and woven ribbons, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
