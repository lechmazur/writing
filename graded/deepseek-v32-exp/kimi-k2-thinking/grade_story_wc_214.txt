<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sola's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with her spiritual curiosity driving micro-choices like tracing stars and speaking to them, culminating in an earned shift from armored loneliness to vulnerable strength. The final choice to preserve the glass and embrace stillness is motivated by prior causality, with cost felt in her softened heart. However, contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with palpable cost—Sola's vow to tend the quiet garden reconfigures her relationship to solitude, and the station's transformation into a sanctuary is legible in the final image of the glass casting a warm glow. The accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, with each beat—finding the glass, empathizing with stars—tightening the thematic stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is rendered with selective, sensory detail that constrains choice and charges the final image; the yellow lantern glass, wedged in gears and later placed in an alcove, directly shapes Sola's actions and the garden's growth. Sensory hierarchy reflects Sola's POV, narrowing to immediacies like stardust and cooling metal, while the setting evolves consistently from decay to vitality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Sola's agency—her empathy with falling stars deepens into a choice to speak to them and preserve the glass, foreclosing her isolation and reweighting stillness as fertile. The cost is unmistakable in her heart softening and the station pulsing with vitality, though the stakes remain internal without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the yellow glass and falling stars embody vulnerability and stillness, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer where Sola's strength in fragility reweights the cosmos's quiet rhythms. Subtext operates through images like the luminous moss and forgotten constellations, avoiding moralizing while inviting reflection on transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that filters the cosmos through Sola's spiritual curiosity—e.g., "the heavens seemed to exhale." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in chants resonating with metal, and elision (like the station's past) is taught early and pays off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "Her uniform, patched with fragments of meteoric iron, whispered of ages" advancing character and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, enhancing clarity in peak beats such as the meteor shower scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cosmic janitor and overlooked era with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details like stardust-sweeping and lantern glass tracing. Emotional truth in vulnerability feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, charging the final image.</comment>
