<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interior contradiction (rebellion vs. complicity) is embodied in micro-choices like whittling and informing, with grief pooled like dark water. Final endurance is earned by prior causality, and moral ambiguity adds depth without artificial balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with pattern of small acts building to a resonant reconfiguration (figurine offering). Closure lands with cost in the emotional void, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of mandate shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details like turbines' hum and shadows pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects POV urgency, and micro-setting (bouquet, knife) constrains actions, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (whittling, narrating, dog interaction) deepens stakes. Cost is legible in moral compromises, and one meaningful tightening occurs with the dog scene, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief and survival emerges through particulars like whittling and bouquet, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the figurine as quiet art of survival, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, grief-filtered). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., lover's loss) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("blades turned with a low, constant hum") serves pressure and clarity. No scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes with specific details (whittling as rebellion) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes, and emotional truth avoids templates. Premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
