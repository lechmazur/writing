<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied actions like glassblowing. His final choice to leave the bowl is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the thawing parallel. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his restrained glassblowing versus abandoning restraint for the large bowl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marek realizes the purpose of safe zones, reinforced by the gauge flicker. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, imagery and emotional depth escalate coherently. Cost is legible in the parallel between the dam's leaks and Marek's heart thawing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned control room constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like the "residual hum" and "rhythmic pulses" of water seeping. Micro-setting elements like the bookmark and bowl are integral to action and theme, shaping Marek's decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Marek's agency, as the thaw accelerates and he abandons restraint to blow the bowl. The dominant stake of internal conflict with grief tightens, with cost felt in the "weighty lightness" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the question jars and thaw imagery, offering a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in objects like the bookmark, which shifts meaning at the end to represent an "entrance" rather than a flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Marek's contemplative voice and rhythmic prose. Narration of mundane tasks to absent machinery enhances character, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "slow unclenching of the valley's collective heart" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of glassblowing, grief, and an abandoned dam feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyric closure. Specific details like "question jars" transform familiar tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
