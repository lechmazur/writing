<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her motivation to become visible through caching objects is consistent and compels higher-stakes choices, culminating in an earned Charged Poise where her smile and felt connection demonstrate a credible endurance with visible cost. The boy serves as a secondary crucible, though his hollow cheeks and story-hunger are briefly shown, aligning with scope. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her retreat to the crawl space versus her need to be seen, without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mara's smiled isolation and the boy's reading voice, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words ("library's subbasement," "Mara moved"), and causality is tight with her caching actions leading inevitably to the boy's discovery. The persistent constraint of the library's architecture shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of her heart keeping time with his words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the shadowed library and pipe chases constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "ferromagnetic tape reel" and "phantom vibration" are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her POV. The environment functions as micro-setting, altering tactics (e.g., access panels, steam pipes) and mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the sapphire-hush atmosphere evolves consistently with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with her caching actions deepening the stake of visibility and connection; cost is unmistakable in the boy's discovery and her held breath, foreclosing her isolation with a visible price. The dominant stake is signaled early ("someone would need what she could offer"), and one meaningful tightening occurs when the boy pockets the fragment, reweighting options. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres through sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of visibility and kindness emerges organically through particulars like the cached objects and sense memory, without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the boy's reading and Mara's smile, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as her retreat and the tape's weight, inviting reflection without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through coal smoke taste and building's breath, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in her sense memory and methodical attention; voice is textured and rhythmic, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., "sapphire-hush moments") is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present (librarian's call), and elision is legible, supporting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "exhaled shadows" is pattern-taught and coherent, though minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "sapphire-hush moments") slightly reduces clarity without harming closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation, and syntax supports emotional beats, such as the crescendo at the boy's discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of crawl space dweller and sense memory, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Details are particular to Mara's voice and setting, and the final reconfiguration (Charged Poise) arises from established pattern and character choice.</comment>
