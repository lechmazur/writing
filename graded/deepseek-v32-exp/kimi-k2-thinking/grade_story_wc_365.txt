<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is concrete and driven by sensory-specific interiority; her final choice to bear the weight of truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the quick test. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently demonstrated, such as her hands tingling from the weave.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure lands as a decisive change (becoming guardian) with felt cost (weight of truth) on-page. Orientation is anchored early, and the shard's cyclical nature shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the repair bay hosts the rift, and the shard as a micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the shard to redirecting the rift, with cost legible in the burden she accepts. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical guardianship emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant non-literal answer via the compass metaphor. Subtext in the shard's echo deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., half-remembered dreams) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; minor figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "cascade of parallel universes") slightly limits clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes sensory mapping and multiverse weaving with originality; risk-taking in cyclical structure heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
