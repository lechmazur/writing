<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as untangling the threads with care. However, internal conflict is minimal, and the resolution lacks contradictory impulses, limiting depth. The final realization is earned but with subtle cost, not fully meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as the gardener understands intentions woven into silence, with felt cost in the velveteen gloom. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through descriptive density. Orientation is clear early, and the tapestry constrains choices, but the lens could be more tightly woven into causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the cobalt silo and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the gardener's POV. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the gardener's agency in decoding the tapestry, under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the emotional weight. However, escalation is gradual without a sharp turn, and the dominance of internal conflict limits external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's story, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on unspoken intentions. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the gardener's introspective nature. Rhythm and diction are controlled, though some repetition of phrases like "velveteen gloom" slightly dulls novelty. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic, with strong rhythm and varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor artifacts include repetitive stems (e.g., "uncharted echoes") and slight register consistency in peak beats, but no major loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener, silo, and tapestry feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, and the core premise is transformed through grounded details.</comment>
