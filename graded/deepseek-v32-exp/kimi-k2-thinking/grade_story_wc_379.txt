<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a curator; her interiority is concrete through embodied actions like the locket growing warm. Her final choice to curate with deeper purpose is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the community's preservation. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages from the locket discovery to the mailbox resolution. Closure is a decisive change—the mailbox opened, letters displayed—with felt cost in the community's unified action. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or outline sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—courtyard with adobe walls, jasmine vines—and constrains choices, such as the key hidden where jasmine blooms white. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, charging the final image of the preserved courtyard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency under the causal lens, from investigation to community mobilization.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges through particulars like the letters and neighborhood stories, not direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature in her curated observations.

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "painting the adobe walls in shades of apricot and rose" is purposeful and clear, avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of thrift-store curation and community mystery, transformed through specific details like the locket's note.
