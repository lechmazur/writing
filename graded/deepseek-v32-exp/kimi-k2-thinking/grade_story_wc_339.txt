<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his analytic nature; his internal conflict between measurement and emotion is embodied in actions like noting the snow globe's properties. The final reclassification of grief is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ascent and acceptance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his analytical focus versus the emotional weight of the snow globe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: Cassian reclassifies grief from kinetic to potential memory, encapsulated in "weight plus time, divided by acceptance." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building density around memory and loss. Orientation is clear early, and the snow globe as a persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sunken library and snow globe constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "water pressed against the hull like an old regret" are filtered through POV, mirroring internal states. The micro-setting of the snow globe acts as a key object that alters tactics and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cassian's agency under the accumulative lens, as his observations tighten the stake of understanding letting go. Cost is legible in his realization that "the force required to let go was equal to the force of will that had kept it," foreclosing earlier options. One meaningful deepening occurs through his interaction with Mort and the snow globe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the snow globe and last transmission, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Cassian's reclassification. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as Mort's patience as entropy, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with sophistication, as "understanding is its own form of buoyancy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Cassian's analytic voice reflected in rhythmic prose like "snow whirled around the static plane." Dialogue with Mort is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping; the perceptual signature is consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "Mort watched, patient as entropy." Minor quibble: "like an old regret" borders on cliché, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of deep-sea exploration, historical mystery, and philosophical inquiry, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed, such as Death as Mort and the snow globe as a singularity of memory. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with a specific, irreplaceable premise.</comment>
