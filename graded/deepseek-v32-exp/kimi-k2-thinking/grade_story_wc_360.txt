<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions. His habit of borrowing personalities creates internal conflict, and his realization that emotion cannot be solved linearly is earned by prior causality. The final choice to embrace turbulence has visible cost in his hollow feeling and the dimming halo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Cassian records "Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther," reweighting the premise with cost felt in the hollow feeling and vanishing stars. The causal lens holds tightly, with experiments leading to realization. Orientation is clear early, and the halo fragment's persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and vanishing stars create a vivid atmosphere that pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details like "pulsing like a captured heartbeat" and "copper shadows" are selective and purposeful. The halo fragment and press act as micro-settings that constrain actions and evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cassian's agency through experiments with the mathematician and poet, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is unmistakable in the transposed empathy reversing and leaving him hollow. The dominant stake of understanding emotion mathematics tightens meaningfully under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in images like vanishing stars and the halo's pulse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional complexity avoids tidy resolutions, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Cassian's analytical yet turbulent voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and deliberate ambiguity is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "lucid turbulence" is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks. Clarity and propulsion are maintained, and the final image is charged without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes transposed empathy and personality borrowing in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with abstract concepts and poetic prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in the halo fragment and topaz workshop anchors universals, transforming tropes.</comment>
