<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to unbind the chronic hush is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like recreating the bonfire ritual. Interiority is concrete through acoustic perceptions and embodied emotions, such as hearing "ghostly whispers" and feeling the "weight of silence." The final choice to play violin and embrace the unfinished is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fracture of the hush. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like longing versus action, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the chronic hush is accompanied by hope, with cost legible in the "fracture" and "whisper of hope." Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern intensifies through sensory density and cadence shifts. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with who, where, and when anchored. The inferred lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices, such as using driftwood from shipwrecks for the fire, and charges the final image with the greenhouse echoing music. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "crackle of flames" and "shattered glass," filtered through the protagonist's acoustic perception. The environment constrains tactics and mirrors internal states, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming the chronic hush escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens through protagonist agency: building the fire, telling a story, and playing violin. A meaningful tightening occurs as the hush fractures, with cost legible in the "weight of the unfinished." Pressure coheres and deepens, narrowing options without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in the unfinished emerges through events and images, not direct statement, such as the "unfinished symphony" and the bowl "brimming with the echo of flames." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the fire's whispers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature biased toward acoustic awareness, like hearing "secrets only she can hear." Voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, with purposeful compression in peak beats. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "each note she draws is a thread that unbinds the silence," without muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic silence and artistic resilience, with specific details like the "echo-harbor violinist" and "sunken orchard greenhouse." Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
