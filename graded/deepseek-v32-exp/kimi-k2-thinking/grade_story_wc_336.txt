<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vespera's motivation is clear and rooted in her insatiable creativity, driving high-stakes choices like weaving essences; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and her collapse shows cost, but minor abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the tree growing and wonder multiplying) under an accumulative/textural lens, cost is legible in her stained hands, and orientation is clear early; the seed's use shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the parapet and waterfall weaving into action; micro-setting (the seed) constrains choice and charges the final image, though sensory detail occasionally prioritizes visual over other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder) escalate through Vespera's agency under accumulative lens, with cost in her collapse; one meaningful tightening (seed cracking) forecloses options, but density increase is slightly uneven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weaving wonder emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the final tree and doorways; ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, resonating through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, perceptual signature selective; purposeful compression (e.g., seven days summarized) is taught and legible, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "color that had no name") slightly muddles clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes weaving worlds with fresh angle, transforming tropes through specific details like essence capture; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
