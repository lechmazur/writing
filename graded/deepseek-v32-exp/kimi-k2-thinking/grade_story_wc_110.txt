<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by curiosity and a desire to restore trust. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her heart beating in the resonant hush, and micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to investigate the doodles, reveal her earned change. Minor tell-y moments like "Curiosity led her" prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, events link coherently from lens discovery to resolution. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in the confession and restored trust, anchored early in orientation. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of hidden evidence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with rain-washed stones and whispering crystals that charge the final image of prisms and harmony. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action, though the forecourt doesn't directly constrain choices, capping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Elara's agency, from finding the lens to confronting the manager. Cost is legible in the emotional weight and confession, narrowing options meaningfully under the causal lens, though stakes remain somewhat internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transparency freeing doubt emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in hidden messages and the final resonant image of trust. Avoids moralizing, but occasional explicit phrasing like "transparency could free" slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, slightly lyrical voice filtered through Elara's perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off, though some repetitive phrasing in emotional beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with varied sentences and purposeful imagery. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is controlled, and information density is high, advancing story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle on trust and discovery through the specific lens and ticket doodles, transforming familiar tropes with grounded details. Synthesis feels organic, though not radically innovative, and risk-taking is moderate but coherent.</comment>
