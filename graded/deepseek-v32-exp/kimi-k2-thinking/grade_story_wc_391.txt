<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to sculpt patience from impatience is clear and consistent, driving her purposeful actions. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the viaduct's hum in her teeth. The final choice to activate the transmitter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the community's waiting. However, her younger impatience is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—the revolution's release—and cost is legible in the people's sudden quiet minds. The inferred causal lens holds tightly, with Elara's calculations and actions leading directly to the outcome. The magnetic viaduct and moon paths serve as persistent constraints that shape tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the "flash-frozen skin of light" on the viaduct are filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively guides the plot, as the ice's pressure ridges and viaduct's magnetic field are integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. tyranny escalates under the causal lens through Elara's agency, culminating in her transmitting the pulse. Cost is unmistakable in the seventeen lunar cycles of waiting and the final disablement of the communication network. The tightening is driven by protagonist choices, narrowing options meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patience as a revolutionary force emerges organically through events like tracking moon paths and the community's unyoking. Subtext operates in images such as the viaduct's "restrained wildness." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final reflection on "wildness refined."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elara's meticulous nature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and rhythmic control is evident in lines like "Her restraint was a wildness held in check." No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., the tyrant's backstory) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "magnetic song" is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in phrases like "patient revolution of seasons" slightly reduces concision, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of horizon mapping and patient revolution is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar tropes. Specific details like the magnetic viaduct after rain feel organic and indispensable. Risk-taking in the quiet, release-based climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation through character choice is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
