<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vendor's mindful scattering and unincised story show interior contradiction; woman's cracked voice and gasp embody emotion under pressure. Final choice to begin writing earned through incision with visible cost of facing absences. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as woman writes from silence and vendor remains at threshold, cost legible in "tug in the lattice of absences." Orientation clear early; persistent constraint of vendor's role shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard library and bottled moonlight constrain choices (incision) and charge final image; sensory details like "footsteps ringing" and "moonlight spill" are selective and purposeful. Environment directly pressures tactics, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) escalates through vendor's agency in incision; cost is unmistakable in "precise relief" and woman's gasp. Under accumulative lens, density of absence imagery tightens stakes with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings in silence emerges through images like "glimmering parole" and "incision"; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV stable with vendor's focalization; voice has distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "mindfully scattered" and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue minimal but natural; no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold, figurative language consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes with sentences advancing story; minor density in peak beats but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fresh with bottled moonlight and quantification of absence; tropes transformed through specific choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is charged.</comment>
