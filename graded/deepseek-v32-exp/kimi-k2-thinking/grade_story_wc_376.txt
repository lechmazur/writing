<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final change—transcribing her lost conversation—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she confronts her buried truth. Minor tidiness in emotional arc prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a strong causal chain from inciting incident to closure, with orientation anchored early. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her realization that "every small honest moment creates a leaf that never wilts" reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Lens (causal) holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices, such as the greenhouse city's toxic sky pressuring movement and the archive constraining discovery. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the environment charging the final image of the "quiet oasis."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding truth) escalates through protagonist agency, from piecing the map to confronting the guard and exploring the archive. Cost is legible when she hears her own voice, forcing a trade-off that forecloses denial. Pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges organically from events and images, such as the wilting trait and archive function, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final scroll transcription, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue in the guard scene is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., map discovery) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and the final image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and transformative, synthesizing a wilting calligrapher with a post-apocalyptic archive of truth. Emotional specificity avoids tropes, and risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
