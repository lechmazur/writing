<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. His transformation from silent ferryman to active gardener is earned through on-page actions, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of the battlefield's scarred state carries visible cost in the garden's renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with the garden reclaiming the battlefield, and cost is legible in the "living tapestry" image. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of seed pods and bird calls builds cohesively to the ending without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the blooming jetty and battlefield are woven into action with sensory detail. The environment shapes tactics, such as using bird calls to map soil, and the recurring seed pods evolve in meaning, supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the coachman's chanting and seed-scattering tightening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the battlefield's transformation, and the dominant stake of renewal deepens through his actions, foreclosing the path of desolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of submerged concord emerges through particulars like the reef's ghost and bird calls, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the garden sharing breath between living and dead. Subtext operates in silence and image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; elision in dead languages is taught and paid off at closure. Rhythmic control heightens tension without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in dense beats, but it serves the accumulative pattern without muddling closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; the coachman's role and submerged concord offer a fresh angle on renewal tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with specificity.</comment>
