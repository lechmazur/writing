<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Adrian's motivation is clear and rooted in his disgust with beautifying lies, driving his actions. However, internal conflict is stated rather than shown in scene, and his character arc is minimal, focusing more on affecting others. The final choice to un-tell stories is earned, with cost visible in audience reactions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the audience's epiphanies reconfigure their narratives with felt cost. The Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with the story stick as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from puppet shows to realizations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the radar dome and story stick constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "blue glare" and "meteor hush" are purposeful and filtered through POV, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) escalates through Adrian's agency in reversing narratives, narrowing options for the audience with visible cost (e.g., trucker's contemplative exit). Under the Hybrid lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully in one continuous scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges through concrete reversals of narratives, with subtext in audience reactions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "meteor hush" and backward telling, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with controlled omniscient POV shifts that remain legible. Dialogue is minimal but natural; perceptual signature is strong, though minor distance fluctuations occur in audience sections without harming closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "shadows that seemed to swallow the present" is consistent and clear, enhancing propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing calligraphy, puppet shows, and narrative reversal with specificity. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
