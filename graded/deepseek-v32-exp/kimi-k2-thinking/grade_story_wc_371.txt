<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving key choices like uncloaking her purpose and the bread ritual. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "the caretaker's daughter cried silently." Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and the final act is earned with visible cost. Secondary characters are brief but functional, applying emotional pressure without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration—the group's witnessing ritual reweights meaning with cost legible in "refusing to let the forgetting happen unnoticed." Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, from Mara's gardening to the collective act. Persistent constraint of forgetting shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices, e.g., the overgrown courtyard enables guerrilla gardening, and the secret tea house charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves." Environment constrains action and supports theme without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting forgetting—escalates under accumulative lens from individual acts to collective ritual, driven by Mara's agency. Cost is unmistakable in emotional responses and the scattering of bread crumbs. No coincidence; deepening reweights options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bread ritual and gardening, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to sacredness in ordinary. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., the veteran kneeling. No moralizing; earned wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "ghost of yeast and memory." Voice is poetic yet grounded, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits zero artifacts, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is effective and consistent, e.g., "tenuous absolution... thin as spider silk." Sentences advance story without loops or scaffold; closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of memory resistance through specific details like guerrilla gardening and bread sacrament. Emotional truth avoids tropes; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
