<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. However, the final choice lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the endurance feels slightly passive, though earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's defiance and hope, under an Accumulative lens. The lens holds, and orientation is clear early, but the cost is more implied than sharply legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember alcove and radio glow constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mira's POV. Setting actively pressures tactics and supports the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by Mira's agency in transcribing and hiding, with cost legible in her risk. However, pressure remains internal, lacking external friction to heighten tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like dust and luminous ink, offering a non-literal answer to rebirth through art. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing, and the ending resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose that reflects Mira's perception. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., dust motifs) is taught and pays off, though rhythm can be overly ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor overwriting and repetitive "dust" motifs occur without harming clarity. No major artifacts or loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes music, dust, and famine into a fresh, non-obvious narrative with risk-taking in style. Specific details transform tropes, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
