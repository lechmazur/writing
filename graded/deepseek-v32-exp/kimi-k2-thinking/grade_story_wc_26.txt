<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in quiet vigilance; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., stone feeling heavier each dusk). Final choice to use the stone is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in empty pocket and luminous regret. Minor slip: some interiority edges abstract but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shadow metamorphosis) with cost legible in "heart full of luminous regret." Orientation is clear early; causality links observation to action via stone. Persistent constraint (stone) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (carpet of clouds, petals of glass) filtered through POV. Micro-setting (river stone) constrains choice and charges final image, transforming shadow. Environment pressures choices and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope) escalates under accumulative lens via shadow's boldness and stone's catalytic role. Protagonist agency drives transformation with cost (loss of stone). Meaningful tightening forecloses option, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope and loss emerges through events and images (stone, shadow metamorphosis), not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with bittersweet warmth. Subtext in luminous regret avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, attentive rhythm). No head-hopping; elision (stone's secret) taught and paid off. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "softly deliberate gesture" in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful ("edges fraying like old film"). Propulsion clear, especially in transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, floating library, and shadow transformation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (river stone) anchor emotional truth.</comment>
