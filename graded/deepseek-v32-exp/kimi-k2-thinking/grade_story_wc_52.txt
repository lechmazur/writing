<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to harvest lessons from loss is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices like carving the lion. Interiority is concrete with contradictions (e.g., wanting to hold memory while letting it transform), and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in her acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Mara accepts the here-and-gone nature of memory, with cost felt in "the warmth seep through the cracks of her grief." Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the rain-beaded skylight loft charges the final image, and objects like the carving blank and quartz prism shape tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between holding and releasing memory) escalates through Mara's agency in carving and crystallizing time. Cost is legible in her emotional shift, and pressure tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory's transformation emerges through particulars like the carving and rain droplets, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "here-and-gone") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion advances story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and memory through specific elements (crystallized time, ash carving) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids cliché.</comment>
