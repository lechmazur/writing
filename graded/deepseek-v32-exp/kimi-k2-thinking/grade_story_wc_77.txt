<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions under pressure. Her final choice to confront fear is earned through prior causality, and micro-choices like clutching the clasp reveal values. The whispering advisor adds depth but borders on abstract, slightly reducing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira defeats the fear entities, and the cost is legible in the clasp growing cold and mirrors cracking. Causal drive holds strong from attic to funhouse, with orientation anchored early. The final image reconfigures her control over fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the funhouse mirror maze constraining choices and charging the climax. Sensory details like "oily sheen" and "corrupted gold" reflect Mira's POV, and atmosphere tightens pressure. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from entering the funhouse to confronting fears with the clasp. Dominant stake of overcoming fear tightens through her choices, with cost visible in the clasp's extinguished light. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as fear's weakness revealed through survival. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "she now held the handle," avoiding moralizing. Subtext in paradoxical notes enriches complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mira's perceptual signature filtering sensory details. Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and elision in advisor's speech is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no major artifacts. Figurative language like "ghostlights" coheres, and sentence variety supports momentum. Minor slips in peak beats do not obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is innovative with second heartbeat and lingering luminance, transforming horror tropes through specific character choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
