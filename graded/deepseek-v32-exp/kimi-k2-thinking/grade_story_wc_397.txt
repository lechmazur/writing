<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict is embodied through contradictory impulses (e.g., almost turning back but moving forward for the dead). The shift from euthanasia tourist to keeper of small mercies is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her altered stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in her realization that "the end was a sound you learned to listen for, not a silence." Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by ice and wind motifs that shape tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (ice cracks alter her path) and charging the final image (ice as "a path of silver"). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with coherent spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: her decision to trawl despite fear deepens stakes, leading to a cost-legible renunciation of initial goal. Dominant stake (internal conflict between death and life) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (parasol tip, ice sounds) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "windborne solace" and continuity, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose modulates rhythm with emotional pressure (e.g., "the ice groaned, a deep, resonant sigh"). Elision (e.g., "grips reality loosely") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "world were a scarf she could lose") is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes euthanasia tourism with disaster relief in a non-obvious way; specific details (e.g., parasol tip as ghost of summer) feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
