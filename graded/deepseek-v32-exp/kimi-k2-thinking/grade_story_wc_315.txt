<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene. Final choice to revise sequence is earned by prior causality and muscle memory, with visible cost in lingering burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change (tether secured) and felt cost ("weight lift slightly, though never fully vanish") under causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (watcher's burden) shapes tactics. Causality is tight from radio warning to revision, with no plot breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with nocturnal arbor and clouds filtering POV perception. Micro-setting (parachute buckle) constrains choice and charges final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tether integrity and trust) escalates under causal lens via radio warning and time pressure. Protagonist agency drives revision, with cost legible in burden lifting but persisting. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust and burden emerges from events and images (buckle, echo) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through lingering duty. Subtext operates in implication, though epiphany could be more earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, data streams). Voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting in repeated "soundless echo" mildly dulls closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of vigil and tech, transformed through specific details (arbor, buckle). Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
