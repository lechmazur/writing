<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority showing contradictory yearning and fear. Her final choice to seek help is earned by prior causality, and Moira's shrewd innocence is consistently shown through dialogue and expression. Micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchies, such as Elena clutching the tooth and admitting her mapping error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from tooth arrival to garden confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change as Elena commits to undoing her work, with cost legible in "constellations that point to my own failure." Orientation is anchored early by quarry reference and maze entrance, and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Secret garden setting constrains choice by forcing the climactic revelation and charges the final image with morning glories as "points of light." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "morning glories climbed rusted trellises," reflecting Elena's urgency. Spatial choreography is coherent from maze entrance to sundial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus career certainty escalates through Elena's agency: receiving the tooth, seeking Moira, and proposing to tell the real story. Cost is visible in her acknowledgment of failure and the identification of Clara's body. One meaningful tightening occurs when Moira's revelation forces Elena to confront her errors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of certainty as cruelty emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in "bone setting" as narrative mending. The final telescope image offers a non-literal answer, reweighting mistakes as "corrections" in a new constellation. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the tooth and garden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with Elena's perceptual signature evident in phrases like "cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow three decades." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Moira's "Failure is just the first draft of memory." Prose rhythm varies purposefully under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "words settled like sediment" is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifactual issues obscure causality or closure; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing forensic folklore with emotional truth, transforming the changeling trope through specific choices like the tooth's DNA proof. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet climax. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in Moira's layered innocence.</comment>
