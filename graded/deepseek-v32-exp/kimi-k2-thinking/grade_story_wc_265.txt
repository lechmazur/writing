<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies through her journey; interiority is embodied in specific perceptions like the gear turning and wind as syntax, earning her transformation from logician to architect with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where she becomes the forest's architect, with cost legible in the gear's turn and her renewed agency; orientation is clear early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under accumulative lens, with cost visible in her shift from seeking explanations to collecting questions; stakes tighten through translocations and insights.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wildness and mechanism as lovers emerges from particulars like the gear and wind syntax; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
