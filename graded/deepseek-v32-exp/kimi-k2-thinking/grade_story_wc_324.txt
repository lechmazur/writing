<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and earned final choice to continue tracing pulses. The shift from tracking the dead to saving the living demonstrates credible internal conflict without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the protagonist's realization of purpose, under a hybrid lens leaning accumulative. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from pulse to rescue. The final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and charges the final image with mist as a "guardian's cloak." Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, with the hearing aid and photograph as micro-settings that constrain choice and deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes to protect vulnerable voices escalate through protagonist's agency, driven by curiosity to the incidental heroism. Cost is legible in trembling hands and the reconfigured purpose, under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection between living and dead emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the hearing aid's dual role. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesizes supernatural and real elements through specific details. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
