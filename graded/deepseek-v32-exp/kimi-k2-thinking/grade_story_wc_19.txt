<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and silence-collecting desire are embodied and drive micro-choices; internal conflict between fear and exhilaration during climb feels authentic; final endurance and renunciation are earned by prior causality, with cost in "stretched knot" of claustrophobia balancing transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where bunker becomes "secret garden of hush," with cost legible in persistent claustrophobia; orientation is immediate, and causality flows through doll's discovery to gravity inversion and ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges final image: bunker's pressure and trellis's altitude shape tactics; sensory details like "gilded hush" and "crisp and flavorless" silence are selective and POV-filtered; recurring doll object evolves meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: she actively climbs trellis and harvests silence, tightening stakes; cost is unmistakable in fear during inversion and ongoing claustrophobia, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as prison and garden emerges implicitly from events and images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in "even a prison could hold a garden" without moralizing; subtext operates through doll's sprouting threads and collected flavors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and cohesive, e.g., "stretched knot" and "gilded hush"; rhythmic control under pressure supports accumulative design; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "sprout invisible threads" is consistent and enhances clarity; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, e.g., during gravity inversion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes silence-collecting and gravity inversion with originality; emotional truth in claustrophobia and yearning feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
