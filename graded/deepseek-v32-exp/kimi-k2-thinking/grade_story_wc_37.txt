<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his amnesiac state, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in memory scattering, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: the mica window cracks and memory scatters for the realm's rebirth. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation anchored early and causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the alchemical orchard and mica window constraining choices and charging the final image. The atmosphere supports the theme without generic elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, from using the mica to singing, culminating in a sacrifice with unmistakable cost. The dominant stake of rekindling the realm tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and sacrifice emerges through concrete events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the final lullaby and cracked mica.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elias's fragmented memory. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the cracking mica.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes memory keeper, mirror world, and alchemy into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth resonates.</comment>
