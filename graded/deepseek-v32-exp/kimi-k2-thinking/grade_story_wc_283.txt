<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation evolves credibly from archival duty to urgent sharing, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the prophecy's revelation reweights time's meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the amber warehouse and petrified sap supply tactile resources that pressure tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her transformation. The dominant stake (unraveling prophecy) tightens through her cataloging efforts, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges organically from events, with the prophecy offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects the turner's worldview. Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., "time pooled like resin") are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports clarity, even in peak beats like the prophecy's revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements into an inevitable whole, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation that heightens stakes. The transformation of time-keeping tropes through specific detail feels fresh and integrated.</comment>
