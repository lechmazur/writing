<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from scholarly ambition to shared responsibility, with embodied micro-choices like trembling hands during typing. The final renunciation of solitary burden is earned by prior causality, and her internal conflict is shown through the realization that she and the ancient scribe are "one continuous thread." No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the daylilies brightening and the final sentence's weight. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through stellar pulses and patterned revelations. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the shared burden constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through the telescope and photometer, charging the final image with the daylilies' transformation. Sensory details like "wooden ribs breathing with the mountain wind" are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting elements (telegram, stars) actively pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in monitoring variable stars and witnessing the scribe, leading to a decisive reweighting of stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the daylilies restoring and the words settling with weight. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of solitary burden-bearing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the daylilies, star pulses, and final realization, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "constellation" and whispered promise. Subtext operates in the telegram's fragile petals and the predecessor's notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature evident in phrases like "accusing the darkness." Rhythm controls pressure, e.g., the variable star's cadence mirroring forgotten languages. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., trance state) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "photonic amber" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without padding, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes celestial decoding and shared burdens with inevitability, transforming the chronicler trope through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in the daylilies' one-day bloom eternalized.</comment>
