<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final realization about her own unnameable fear is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the mirror reflection. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the mirror image, reconfiguring her duty and sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The echo of sacrifice shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details woven through action. The sextant, prism, and atlas page function as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect the reaper's POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increase as fears are crystallized, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in her sacrifice and the mirror crystallization. The dominant stake of naming fears tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the mirror reflection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to naming fears without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through scene work, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control is evident in peaks, and purposeful elision (e.g., forgotten phrases) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peaks. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reaper tropes through specific details like crystallizing fears, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Bold choices cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
