<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The druid's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; his internal conflict is embodied in moments like "the taste of ash on his tongue," and his realization of guilt is earned through causality. Micro-choices, such as planting the seed, reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the confession rises and the druid understands his guilt, with cost legible in "his guarded heart lighter, though the warlike serenity remained." The causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard vortex and cursed lake constraining choices (e.g., pulling at his cloak) and charging the final image of the settled grove. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the druid's agency, from the failed trick to using the seed, narrowing options with cost in his realization. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens meaningfully under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the confession revealing buried guilt and the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about mirrors and hidden scars. No moralizing; subtext operates through imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature (e.g., "warlike serenity"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "maelstrom of dead fruit and rot," supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements like the frozen confession and flesh-eating seed are synthesized freshly, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in the concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
