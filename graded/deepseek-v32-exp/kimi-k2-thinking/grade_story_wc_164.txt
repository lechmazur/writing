<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with concrete interiority like "pang of sorrow" and "curious joy." Her final realization is earned through prior causality, though some emotional phrasing edges toward stock. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the closure cost is legible in her "cheerful gloom."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Lira understands the sea's memory cycle, costing her prior certainty. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the geode sequence tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the "briny froth" to the "iridescent cave," constraining choices as the geode enables the glass's use and seed growth. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the tide pool and foam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Lira's agency in planting seeds and retrieving fragments, narrowing options to a deepening realization. Cost is legible in the "sweet sorrow" that forecloses her initial path, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory cycles emerges through particulars like the crater glass and sea foam, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "sea's endless recollection," reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in the geode sequence is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Lira's lexicon, enhancing perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "glittering throat" coheres without muddle, and information density supports momentum. Peak beats maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sea-foam recollectionist and crater glass with originality, transforming memory tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
