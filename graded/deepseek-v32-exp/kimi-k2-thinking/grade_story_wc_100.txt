<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undertaker's weary stubbornness is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as their refusal to abandon the dead and the transformation fueled by their own blood. Interior contradictions—yearning for silence yet perpetuating their role—are dramatized in scene, and the final choice to become the beacon is earned by prior causality with visible cost: eternal occupation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with undeniable cost in the final image: "the undertaker understood then that their stubbornness had built not an escape, but an eternal occupation." The drive lens holds, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater library functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details like "shelves groaned with the weight of waterlogged histories" and the atrium where "water and air refused to separate." It pressures the protagonist's actions and supplies key materials, shaping the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the undertaker's agency, from receiving the package to rebuilding the lens, with cost legible in their transformation and eternal role. The dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—tightens through density increases and cadence shifts, foreclosing the option of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the lens splitting signals for individual souls, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of rest and duty. Subtext operates in implications, like the undertaker's chased stillness, without moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person, with a distinct perceptual signature in lyrical, water-logged prose that reflects the undertaker's weary consciousness. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the package's origin) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, such as "their own shadow stretching across the drowned city like a permanent fixture," is coherent and advances atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (undertaker, lighthouse) into a fresh, non-obvious concept with specific lived detail, such as the lens drinking the undertaker's blood. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric tone heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
