<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to read the letters is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the temporary healing. Interiority is concrete, though backstory is briefly tell-y but anchored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the released letters and healing. Accumulative lens holds with coherent buildup through imagery and ritual. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (mangrove labyrinth pressures movement) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from bringing letters to reading them, with cost legible in the emotional release and temporary healing. Stakes are internal but deeply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions and images (apology, listening) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and spirits' songs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural. Minor register consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (swamp, spirits, letters) feels fresh and inevitable, with bold lyrical risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
