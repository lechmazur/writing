<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation is clear and rooted in silent empathy; interiority is embodied through actions like weaving light, and the child's change is earned. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the child's smile and changed perspective. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—cobalt dock and shutters constrain choices by enabling light-weaving; sensory details (e.g., smell of iron) are selective and charged in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (child's fear vs. hope) escalate through guardian's agency in weaving light; cost is unmistakable in the child's emotional shift. Coherent pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions (e.g., dental mirror reprise) without moralizing; ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic; perceptual signature is consistent, with silent empathy filtering perception. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical guide tropes with specific tools (dental mirror, shutters); risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
