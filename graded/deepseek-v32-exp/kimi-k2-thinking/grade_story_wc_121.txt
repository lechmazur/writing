<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation burns clear, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; final surrender to the labyrinth feels earned by prior causality, though some abstraction slightly limits emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as she realizes "You are the labyrinth," dissolving into the timeline with felt cost in the ripple's spread; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct and phosphorescent moss create a vivid, purposeful setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through procedural generation and timeline fractures; protagonist's agency drives tightening, with cost legible in her surrender and dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in acceptance of infinite recursion; subtext is rich, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic prose and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language coheres in peak beats like the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractured timelines, procedural generation, and labyrinth of self feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
