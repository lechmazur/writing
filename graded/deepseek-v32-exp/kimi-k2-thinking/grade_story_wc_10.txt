<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to rectify silence is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion through heat-mapping and micro-choices under pressure. Her final shift from forcing sound to letting vibrations speak is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional transformation. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her stubborn need versus silent expression, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—silence becomes a canvas for unshaken marvels—under the Accumulative/Textural lens, which holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image where Mara sees her brother's reflection, reconfiguring meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choice as the resonant surface for the tuning forks and charges the final image with frost patterns. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as heat signatures and frost etching. The setting actively shapes the climax, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as she uses the tuning forks to evoke emotions, leading to a deepening where she redefines her approach to silence. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional shifts and shared feeling among survivors. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of forcing sound, aligning with the quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the frost and vibrations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, like Mara's silent performances. The ending reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in heat-mapping and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, with no head-hopping. Purposeful elision, such as the silent performances, is taught and paid off at closure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "cathedral of unshaken marvels," without muddling peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of silence, heat-mapping, and vibration to transform grief into shared meaning. Specific details like the tuning fork case and frost patterns feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-sound music concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
