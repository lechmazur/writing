<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., checking the vial, adjusting camera). Interiority is concrete and embodied, as in "Her breath fogged the visor." However, no significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses reduce depth, preventing higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost as the bloom wilts and she feels "dawnlit melancholy," under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the hourglass grain's fall triggers a decisive change. Persistent time constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar setting is vivid and sensory, with details like "moonlit summit" and "crystalline bloom" constraining choices by forcing timed action. The bloom charges the final image, and environment pressures protagonist's decisions, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the bloom) escalates under Accumulative lens through hourglass countdown and dawn approach. Protagonist agency drives escalation via chemical trigger setup, with cost legible in the bloom's wilting. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in the bloom as "fragile reminder." Ending reweights prior material without moralizing, as the captured image underscores melancholy and loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "visor reflected the Earth’s distant glow." Voice is poetic and consistent, though no dialogue is present. Rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "blue‑white gem suspended in the void," and closure is clear. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing lunar exploration with ephemeral beauty. Emotional truth avoids cliché, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with authentic vision.</comment>
