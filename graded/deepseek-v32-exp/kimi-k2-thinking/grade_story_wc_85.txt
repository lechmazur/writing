<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and motivation are deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing internal conflict. The final decision to cease manufacturing false memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his hope to quell guilt while sifting through carvings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—his choice to reclaim his narrative—under an accumulative/textural lens, felt cost in the "quiet scar" image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the watch hand's reprise charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the cobalt terrace and driftwood shore shape his search and realization. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the discovery of the plaque tightening stakes and forcing a trade-off. Cost is legible in the "weight of a collapsing wall" moment, though the escalation is slightly reliant on textural buildup rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and regret emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the driftwood carvings' truth. Subtext operates in gestures like the watch hand's pulse, avoiding moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects his guilt. Elision is taught and paid off in closure, though minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score. No head-hopping or dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with figurative language like "sieved hush" serving pressure. Minor template cadence in adjacent sentences ("He knelt... He traced...") causes a slight deduction, but no artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of the genealogist premise and memory themes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar emotional arcs.</comment>
