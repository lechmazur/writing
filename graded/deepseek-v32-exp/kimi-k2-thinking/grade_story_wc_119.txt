<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation to flee her past and transpose her life is clear and consistent, driving her to orchestrate futures. Interiority is concrete, such as flinching at fortune cookies, and her final choice to compose fortunes is earned through prior causality with visible cost in her transformation. Micro-choices under pressure, like writing precise fortunes, reveal her values and agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with clear orientation early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mei Lin gains agency, with cost felt in her letting go of the old self. The lens holds without contradiction, and persistent constraints (specs, open secrets) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral, with the lighthouse and specs constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "Fresnel lens spun its ancient warning," and the environment guides Mei Lin's actions, enhancing atmosphere and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mei Lin's desire to change her life, escalating through her agency in using the specs to orchestrate events. Under the hybrid lens, pressure tightens as she composes fortunes, with cost legible in the outcomes and her transformation. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of orchestrating vs. predicting futures emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in open secrets and her power. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mei Lin's self-directed change, avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mei Lin, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., espionage past) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is natural, and sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of fortune cookies, espionage specs, and lighthouse setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details make the combination organic and memorable.</comment>
