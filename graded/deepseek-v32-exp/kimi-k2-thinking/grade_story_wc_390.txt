<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's logically emotional trait is embodied in contradictory impulses—weeping for the creature while calculating frequencies—and her final choice to use vibrational matching is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tears freezing, changed heart rhythm). Micro-choices under pressure, such as striking the key and humming, reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the shadow-thing dissolves, revealing the drowned keeper, and the ice settles into silence, altering the protagonist's state. Causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages (ice shift forces adaptation, vibrational matching resolves conflict). Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and cost is legible in "tears freezing into crystals" and "heart still tuned to 7.8 hertz."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: drift-ice marina locks boats, forcing adaptation, and the ice becomes a "mirror of rose-gold glass" post-resolution. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "smell of frozen kelp," "bronze and winter" taste). Recurring objects like the key and flute shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: ice shifting locks boats, raising stakes, and her decision to use vibrational matching narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in emotional weeping and the creature's dissolution. Dominant stake (protecting artifact, resolving grief) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of logic-emotion duality emerges through particulars, not statement, culminating in the resonant image of "duty and absolution" defining her. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (e.g., sonic absolution as forgiveness). Ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer through the dissolution and changed rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—engineer's frequency-based perception and poetic rhythm. Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., dense imagery during conflict, quiet after). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "molten coin" for sunset). Clarity is maintained in peak beats, and syntax accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frequency science and mystical absolution feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in blending logic and emotion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
