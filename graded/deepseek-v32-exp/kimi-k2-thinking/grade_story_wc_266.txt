<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lin's motivation to find the dog is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The internal conflict between fear and stirring courage is shown in scene, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, minor abstraction in phrases like "a place where unused courage waits" slightly limits peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Lin understands courage as "a silent, persistent step." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building atmosphere and meaning. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact without breaks, though the ferry guides' arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "salt and pine" and the "veiled ridgeway" constraining choices. The ridgeway and ticket punch charge the final image, and spatial choreography is coherent. Environment actively shapes tactics and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the dog and personal courage escalates under the accumulative lens through Lin's agency in traversing the ridgeway and accepting the ferry ticket. Cost is legible in the persistent steps and reunion. One meaningful tightening occurs, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of courage as silent persistence emerges organically through images and events, not direct statement. The star stamp and shoreline lullaby provide subtext, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, e.g., "heartbeat echoing the hollow surf." Perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure is strong. Minimal dialogue is natural, and elision is purposeful, though some phrases edge toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, e.g., "the tide seemed to swallow hope as well as sand." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and serves momentum. Read-aloud test passes, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of elements like the ferry guides and star stamp, transforming the journey trope through grounded details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
