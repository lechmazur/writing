<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply integrated; her transformation from preservation to transmission is earned with visible cost of self-erosion, though internal conflict is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost (her fading self), and the persistent constraint of muteness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is an active force, with the iceberg fragment and bluff constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens; cost of self-sacrifice is legible and forecloses options, driving the narrative to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of wonder and transmission emerges through concrete images and events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctly lyrical, with perceptual signature enhancing the accumulative texture; no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative language enriches without muddle, though minor overwriting exists.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise is highly original and fully committed; synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
