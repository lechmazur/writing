<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's rationality and motivation to cultivate psychological safety are clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and earned change from fear to balanced management of truth. Internal conflict between hiding and using truth is dramatized, and micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchy. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrases.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds with logical linkages; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where truth is revalued as a tool, with cost legible in the ongoing balance ("fractured grace"). Orientation is clear early, and the eye's power persistently shapes tactics. No causality breaks or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the hanging orchard and storms pressuring choices and supplying resources (e.g., sap for binding). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of healing. Environment constrains choices and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety vs. truth escalates through protagonist's agency, from occluding the eye to uncovering it, forcing raw honesty that cuts through fear. Cost is unmistakable in the fragility of shared safety and the need for measured tones. Coherent pressure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth as a tool for healing emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reweighted value of honesty and balance. Subtext operates in gestures like the eye's gaze and orchard's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, precise, and rational voice that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent. Diction and syntax reflect the protagonist's mindset, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "each sentence a splinter I could not swallow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh elements—post-virus world, truth curse, truffle forager—into an organic whole with specific details. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and community building. Risk-taking in balance of truth and safety heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
