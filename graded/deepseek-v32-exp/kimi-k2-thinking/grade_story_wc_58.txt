<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like binding leaves and writing her own obituary; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the final renunciation (releasing the thread) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the sad smile and offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the thread release and redefined healing geography; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of solitude shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the garden and thread constraining choices and charging the final image; details like moss-covered statues and dark fountain reflect internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency through reflective density and ritual actions; cost is unmistakable in the thread release, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like obituaries and the thread; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (healing as practice) that reweights prior material without moralizing, supported by subtext in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in varied syntax and purposeful elision, such as the recurring thread imagery teaching the pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and supports mood, with no muddle in peak beats like the thread release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in non-obvious synthesis of obituaries for the living and healing geography; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
