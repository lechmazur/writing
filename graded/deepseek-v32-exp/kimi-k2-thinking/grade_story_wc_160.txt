<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alia's characterization is deeply rooted in her profession and internal conflict, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to propose the hybrid plan is earned through prior causality, showcasing a credible endurance with visible cost in the community's doubt. The slyly heartfelt hope and vow are integrated into her actions, though the attribute could be more consistently embodied across beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain from discovery to resolution, with closure as a decisive change (adoption of the hybrid plan) that reconfigures the community's values. The cost is legible in the mountain's tremble and the council's initial doubt. The inferred Causal lens holds throughout, and the antique surveyor's chain acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (sulfurous sigh, cracked flagstone) that pressure choices and charge the final image. The amphitheater and mountain's breath constrain Alia's actions and symbolize the central conflict. Specificity is high, avoiding generic description, and the environment directly influences the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under the Causal lens through Alia's agency, from discovering the chain to facing council doubt. The dominant stake of harmonizing values tightens with each beat, and the cost is felt in the community's division and the mountain's response. Protagonist-driven escalation leads to a meaningful trade-off in the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically through symbols and events, with subtext in the chain and message. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("shared heartbeat") without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Complexity is embraced through the balance of preservation and progress.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Alia's expertise and emotional state. Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift, though some diction is elevated but character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and variation, advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in phrases like "dappled like sunlight" slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis of floodgate mechanics, encrypted messages, and community conflict. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the adhesive analysis method. Risk-taking in the lyrical tone pays off with emotional truth, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
