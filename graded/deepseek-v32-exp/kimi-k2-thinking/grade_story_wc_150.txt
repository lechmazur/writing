<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and rooted in her diaspora experience, with embodied emotions like "dread and hope" and micro-choices under pressure, such as rebuilding the sundial, revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional journey, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the restored sundial and Lina's renewed faith reconfigure meaning with felt cost ("quiet tremor of faith"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early, and persistent constraints of interrupted journeys shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the catacomb orchard and sundial constraining choices (roots guide her to fragments) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "moss and memory" are filtered through Lina's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Lina's agency in purposeful wandering and rebuilding, with cost legible in her emotional shift and the physical act. The dominant stake of restoring continuity tightens meaningfully through discoveries, foreclosing paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and renewal emerges organically through images and actions, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the sundial's shadow. Subtext operates in gestures like brushing dirt, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic but controlled diction and rhythm that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the gradual revelation of the sundial's meaning, taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "air smelled of moss and memory" is consistent and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with no artifacts obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes diaspora return with magical realism in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the bone orchard. Risk-taking in tone and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
