<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her blindness shaping her perception and actions consistently. Her motivation to repair the drone under deadline pressure compels higher-stakes choices, and her final insight to Kael feels earned. Kael adds secondary pressure but is slightly passive, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear causal lens with the repair driving toward a decisive change (drone fixed) and resonant reconfiguration (teaching moment). Closure lands with cost felt in the all-night effort and deadline pressure. Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory details (e.g., "air tasted of salt and engine oil") and constrains choices, such as the depot mist and ship's horn tightening the timeline. The repair shop and water features function as micro-settings that charge the final image of interpretation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (fix drone before dawn) and escalate with the ship's horn, forcing Miren's agency under causal pressure. Cost is legible in her sustained effort, though the escalation is linear without major reversals, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception beyond sight emerges organically through particulars like light refraction and the repaired drone, culminating in a non-literal answer in the final dialogue. Subtext operates in gesture and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Miren's unique perceptual signature, with voice consistent and poetic. Dialogue is natural but brief; elision in her methods is taught and paid off. Minor restraint due to limited dialogue depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "her fingers dancing with solder." No loops or artifacts harm closure; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Very minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of a blind artisan using alternative senses is fresh and transformative, with specific details like mercury pools grounding it. Synthesis feels inevitable, though risk-taking is moderate, and the premise isn't fully unprecedented.</comment>
