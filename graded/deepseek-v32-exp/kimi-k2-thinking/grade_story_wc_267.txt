<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotions like pressing the bolt until nerves scream. Internal conflict shows in her hesitation to report the discoloration, and her final choice to report is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her path back to the choir with visible cost. The nerve regeneration parallels her moral arc, deepening character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change as Elara reports the discoloration and commits to vigilance, with cost legible in her renunciation of rejoining the choir. Causal lens holds strong from past failure to present action. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt fortress and snow creating a pressurized atmosphere. The staircase and discoloration act as micro-settings that constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like "snow pressing against the windows like a mourner's hands" reflect internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety vs. guilt escalates under the causal lens through Elara's agency in finding and reporting the discoloration. Cost is unmistakable in her forfeiture of choir membership and the weight of perpetual vigilance. One meaningful tightening narrows options from passive penance to active repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of safety's cost emerges through particulars like the bolt and discoloration, without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gestures, such as the precentor's nod. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's commitment to speak before silence becomes unpardonable, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., noting "discoloration three stairs higher." Voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (like the exact signs) is taught and paid off. Dialogue in signs is minimal but goal-driven, advancing plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "frostbitten hope" is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story efficiently, and closure image is clear without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of silent-choir concept, nerve regeneration, and guilt, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the bolt as a relic. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
