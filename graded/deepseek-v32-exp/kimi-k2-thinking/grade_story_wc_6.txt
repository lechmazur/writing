<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory as the arsonist's daughter, with internal conflict shown through her choice to heal rather than harm. Her emotions are embodied in actions like cupping the bird and tracing scars, and her final micro-choice to press the coin into the sand demonstrates a hierarchy of values. The closure choice to graft the wing is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the lifting of her father's legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya's scars "sing" and her legacy shifts, with cost legible in the "weight lift" and the final image of the coin. The accumulative/textural lens holds, taught early through recurring images like scars and clouds, and orientation is clear within 120 words. No causality breaks; the structure is a single scene with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (black sand, kelp scent) and charges the final image through the obsidian lagoon's reflective quality. The black sand and coin function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice in the healing action. However, the lagoon itself does not heavily pressure tactics beyond atmosphere, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—proving scars can sing—escalating through Maya's agency in grafting the wing, which deepens thematic cost under the accumulative lens. The choice to use the coin and sand narrows options and forecloses paths, with felt cost in the emotional shift. No coincidence; pressure coheres through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bird's healing and scar imagery, offering a non-literal answer to redemption without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (binding the wing, scattering sand) and the final image of scars as music. The ending reweights prior material through the conceptual repricing of fire's memory as melody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythm that modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., father's backstory) is taught and pays off in closure. Voice remains consistent under stress, with diction matching Maya's introspective nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple jobs (e.g., "scars traced her forearms" conveys character and theme). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the grafting scene. Syntax supports accumulative intensity without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter with healing rituals feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image recharges prior particulars like the coin and scars. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
