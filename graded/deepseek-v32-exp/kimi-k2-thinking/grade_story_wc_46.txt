<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her earthbound nature and desire to share light without fire. Her internal conflict is shown through memories and present actions, with micro-choices like polishing the sea glass revealing her values. The final choice to place the pearl is earned, though minor lacks deeper contradiction or flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through sensory details and Mira's reflections to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure with the pearl scattering light. Cost is legible in her ongoing mission and the grotto's echoes. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the serpentine grotto and sea glass constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, mirroring internal states. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire escalates through Mira's agency in polishing and placing the pearl. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with the pearls' glow, and cost is legible in her continued effort. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sharing stillness and light emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The pearl of stillness offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in sea glass as metaphor enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature tied to Mira's star-watcher perspective. Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision in memories pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, advancing story without major artifacts. Minor overwriting in repeated "pearl of stillness" but no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of sharing light through polished sea glass is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform tropes through character and setting.</comment>
