<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, driving her choices under pressure; the arrow tip's pulse and her decision to release controls show embodied micro-choices. The final renunciation of fighting die-off in favor of pruning with reverence is earned by the discovery, with cost legible in the arrow tip fusing and her altered approach. However, lack of on-page internal contradiction slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael understands resilience and the arrow tip seals, reconfiguring her approach with felt cost; causal lens holds tightly from motivation to discovery. The gravity inversion constraint shapes tactics throughout, and orientation is anchored early. Cost is unmistakable in the fusion and her plan to embrace die-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices through gravity inversion and floating arches, constraining navigation via water flow; sensory details like "whirling silence" and silver ribbons of water are purposeful. The central arch and seed charge the final image, with environment directly enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding resilience) escalates under causal lens through Kael's agency, navigating echoes and releasing controls to discover the seed; cost is legible in the risk of inversion and the arrow tip's transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs as she drifts into the arch, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the seed discovery and echoes, offering a resonant non-literal answer on resilience growing through damage; subtext in the broken arrow tip becoming whole avoids moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as "centrifuge of sound" reflecting Kael's focus; rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lyrical yet precise prose. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice remains coherent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "whirling silence" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes gravity inversion and resilience quest with fresh, non-obvious angle; tropes are transformed through specific details like the arrow tip and echoes. Risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
