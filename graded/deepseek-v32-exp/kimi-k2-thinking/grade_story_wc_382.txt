<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alex's motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to preservation, with Mrs. Voss's traits vividly embodied. The final choice to become the building's scribe is earned through prior causality, though internal conflict could be more contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands with decisive change as Alex presses the seal, costing the negotiation with ghosts. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows seamlessly from borrowing sugar to truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the desk seal charges the final image—and sensory details (bergamot, graffiti) are purposeful. Spatial choreography remains coherent, supporting the theme of memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from learning to active preservation under accumulative lens; Alex's agency in pressing the seal narrows options with cost legible in the building's shiver. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and agreed-upon lies emerges through particulars like the nurses' graffiti, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "conjugate verbs of escape"). Poetic voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; dialogue natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("meteor showers were punctuation marks") coheres without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of building-as-language and dead tutor tropes feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
