<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like forging clearance. Final choice to upload video is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from discovery to action. Closure is a decisive change (uploading video) with felt cost in erased logs and hope, anchored early in orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the archive and patch constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "humming archive" and patch's light are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency, from finding numbers to lying and uploading, narrowing options under causal lens. Cost is legible in defiance and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges through images and events, not statement, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via numbers and songs reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; elision like "sensed absence" is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, voice consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "digital ghosts" is purposeful. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corporate mystery with numbers and songs feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
