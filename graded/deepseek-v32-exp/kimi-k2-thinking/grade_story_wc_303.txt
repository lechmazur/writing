<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between her dream and the empire's offer. Her micro-choices, like hiding the seed and deceiving the envoy, reveal her values under pressure. The final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "mulberry ache" and "quiet certainty." Embodied emotion and lack of stock phrasing strengthen characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, culminating in a decisive change when Lira plants the seed. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with felt cost as she forecloses the empire's path. The envoy's arrival escalates pressure, and the persistent constraint of the empire shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "velvet shadows" and "night-blooming jasmine" filtered through Lira's POV. The observatory garden constrains her choice to plant the seed, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seed autonomy vs. exploitation is signaled early and escalates with the envoy's knock, forcing Lira's choice. Under the causal lens, agency drives escalation, and cost is legible in the lost empire offer and gained sanctuary. One meaningful tightening narrows options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of autonomy vs. exploitation emerges through events and images like the seed and coffee stains, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the planted seed growing into a "tree whose roots would hold the memory of songs." Subtext operates in plant whispers and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in perceptual bias like "whispered secrets only she could hear." Diction and syntax remain consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., coffee stain reading) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "perforated destiny that hung like a torn veil") slightly affects momentum. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm supports scene needs, and closure remains clear. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy, ice violin, and coffee stain reading into a fresh, non-obvious angle on conflict. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the seed as a "living relic." Risk-taking in elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
