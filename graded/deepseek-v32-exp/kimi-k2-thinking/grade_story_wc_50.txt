<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot through micro-choices like reverse-engineering. However, internal contradiction or conflicting impulses are underdeveloped, limiting depth. The final redesign feels earned but lacks visible emotional cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (releasing echoes) and conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is tight, from the broken timer to the redesign, with orientation anchored early. The peripheral focus constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "limestone bench that sweat condensation" integral to the plot. The marble cavern's acoustics constrain choices and charge the final image of echoing voices, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the overload to redesigning the harvest. Cost is legible in the shift from hoarding to sharing echoes, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the locksmith's journey, offering a non-literal answer to storing wonder through understanding. Subtext in echoes as temporal residues avoids moralizing, with resonance in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a perceptual signature shaped by peripheral focus. Poetic prose and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "veins channeling vibrations like secret rivers," enhance coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "temporal residues of moments that refused to die," is purposeful and clear, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of chronomancy, locksmithing, and acoustic memory, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The concept transforms familiar tropes through specific details like rose quartz lenses.</comment>
