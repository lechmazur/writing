<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repairman's motivation is clear and rooted in his curse, with interiority shown through rust reactions and micro-choices like speaking true names. His doubt introduces internal conflict, but its resolution is swift, slightly reducing depth. Final change is earned through honesty, with cost visible in rust pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; orientation is clear early with who, where, when. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (rust healing, dawn restoration). The covenant constraint shapes tactics, and the ending lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific—resonance chamber, quartz pedestal—and constrains choices by amplifying sound. Sensory details are purposeful, but some elements like silver veins could be more integrated into action. Environment charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring light before midnight) is signaled early; escalation driven by time pressure and repairman's doubt. Agency in tethering the chip leads to closure with legible cost (rust agony). Coherent pressure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges through events and images like rust and mending, not direct statement. Subtext in covenant and repair; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., sound shaping). Dialogue is natural but brief. Minor ornate phrases in high-pressure beats do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Slight overwriting in metaphors like "malignant flower" but no muddle in peak beats. Propulsion is clear, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rust curse, philosopher's stone, and resonance chamber feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices; risk-taking in paradoxical method heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh and memorable.</comment>
