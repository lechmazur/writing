<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; the poet's desire to photosynthesize pain into beauty drives her actions, and her persistence is embodied through micro-choices like ensconcing verses. Interiority is concrete, with emotions filtered through centuries of longing, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance—continuing to sing despite the fragile peace—is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the ongoing sleeplessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: the blossom armistice is fragile, and the poet vows to continue, foreclosing rest with visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through repeated images and lullabies. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by the first paragraph. No causality breaks; the postcard's promise and the poet's actions coherently drive the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the gargantuan shell acting as a micro-setting that constrains choice by echoing her lullabies and shaping the spread of peace. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "fossilized moon" shell and "reef-shadow joy." The environment charges the final image, with the shell becoming a "cathedral of peace," and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—achieving peace between merfolk clans—is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through the poet's agency: her lullabies soften rage, leading to spears being laid down. Cost is legible in the armistice's fragility and her ongoing sleeplessness. One meaningful tightening occurs as the merfolk gather, and the resolution is earned by her persistent actions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of photosynthesizing pain into beauty emerges organically through events and images, such as the blossoms spreading like a treaty and the galaxy postcard's promise. Subtext operates in implication, like the "reef-shadow joy" shading past battles. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the poet's continued song, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person, close to the poet, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, lyrical prose that reflects her insomniac state. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as the "frayed" voice carrying moonlight threads. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, with the off-key wind and lullabies taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the poet's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum, with high information density—each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; minor repetition of "shyly unstoppable" feels intentional. Peak beats, like the merfolk dancing, are clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of insomniac poet, merfolk war, and galaxy postcard, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth is specific, with pain turned into petals, and the core premise commits fully. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
