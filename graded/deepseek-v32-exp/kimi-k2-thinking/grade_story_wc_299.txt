<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotions like gripping the scrap; her final choice to keep it is earned by prior causality, showing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her decision to redefine her work; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the valley's echo motif, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the quarry office and valley silence pressure Mara's reflection; the speaker cloth as micro-setting charges the final image, with sensory details like "rust and old paper" filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: the cloth find and Dale's visit deepen internal conflict, leading to her agential decision to keep the scrap, with cost legible in her emotional struggle and redefined purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose after loss emerges through particulars like the cloth and appraisal work; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "each appraisal a quiet performance," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara's voice is reflective and rhythmic; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "echo of blasted rock" is purposeful, and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser roles feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, internal conflict heightens stakes, and specific details like the speaker cloth avoid template plots.</comment>
