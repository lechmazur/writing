<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in academic rebellion and skepticism. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like feeling the amber's warmth. The final choice to share findings is earned by prior causality, with cost in her resolve and irony. However, the character leans slightly single-note, lacking deeper internal contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the realization of the chemistry of homecoming reweights the premise with cost in her bronze resolve and the world's waiting. The Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with footprints and amber constraining tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from path to discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "wet earth and metal scent" filtered through POV. The rainwashed tower and amber constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting elements (amber, tower) actively shape the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding alien homecoming—escalates through agency-driven actions: following footprints, analyzing data. Cost is legible in her resolved stance and irony. Under the Hybrid lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of artificial vs. natural pilgrimage emerges through particulars, with subtext in the irony of "artificial pilgrimage revealing natural truth." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned through concrete discovery and character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, scientific lexicon. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "bronze quiet" tone consistency. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful. Minor ornamentation in descriptions but maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "amber glinted like captured sunlight" is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alien pheromones and homecoming chemistry feels inevitable, with specific details like the amber's resonance. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
