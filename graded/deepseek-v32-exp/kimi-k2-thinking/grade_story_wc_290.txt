<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and motivation are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trembling hands steadying with the compass point) and a final earned triumph. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the resolution carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (key unlocking knowledge), driven by causal linkages under the inferred lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of claustrophobia shapes tactics, with no causality breaks affecting the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting details like the organ's reverberations and starlight chamber are vivid and purposeful, with the compass point constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory selection reflects POV urgency, though some description borders on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with claustrophobic pressure and the organ's guidance forcing a key choice (pressing the compass point) that narrows options. Cost is legible in her triumph over fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wistful rebellion emerges organically from events and images (e.g., key unlocking blueprints, not gold), with subtext in the organ's silence and a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "music seemed to map the darkness"), and voice modulates under pressure. Minor overwriting in peaks slightly reduces rhythmic control, but no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with good rhythm, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "prudently adventurous enough to trust...") and figurative stacking in high-pressure beats cause minor muddle. No loops or scaffolds harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with specificity (e.g., compass point geometry, spatial mutiny), offering a fresh angle through emotional truth and risk-taking. Transformation feels inevitable, though premise familiarity limits higher innovation.</comment>
