<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to fuse insight with empathy is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The faint affection stirred during observation shows contradictory impulses, and the professional detachment is earned with visible cost. However, the client's role is secondary but applies adequate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the dealer's isolation and the emotion's transience, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The static electricity and grotto pulse reinforce the ending's cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amber grotto constrains choice and charges the final image with sensory specificity (honeyed light, resinous scent). The blotter petal and static electricity function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Details are selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the dealer's internal conflict between detachment and empathy, escalating through the administration and observation under the accumulative lens. Agency in dosage adjustment leads to a visible cost (client's temporary warmth and eventual void). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of synthetic empathy and detachment emerges from particulars like the blotter petal and fading emotion, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the repeated "fuse insight with empathy" leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing static, emotional residues). Voice modulates between professional detachment and faint affection, and elision (e.g., half-truths) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is integrated without muddle. Minor density in metaphors, but clarity remains in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a counterfeit emotion dealer using static electricity is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details (blotter petal, amber grotto) transform tropes, and emotional truth in the dealer's conflict feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
