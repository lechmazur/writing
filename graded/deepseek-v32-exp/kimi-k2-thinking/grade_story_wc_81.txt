<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure like readjusting the lantern and testing hypotheses. However, internal contradiction is subtle, lacking deep conflicting impulses, and emotional embodiment is more rational than visceral. The earned stasis at closure has cost, but character complexity is slightly restrained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (reclaimed stillness and light returning) and felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through discoveries like the stamp and registry. The drive lens is consistent, with no breaks affecting the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—sunken library, murky water, blackout—and constrains choices (e.g., lantern use). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image with reclaimed order, and micro-settings like the stamp alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (tracing origins) escalate through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with tightening via hypothesis testing and discoveries. Cost is legible in reclaimed stillness and foreclosed paths. However, escalation is more gradual than sharply causal, slightly limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed truth emerges through particulars like the stamp and watermark, not statement. Subtext operates in images and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—logical, calm, and perceptive. Voice controls rhythm under pressure, and elision (e.g., blackout implications) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes sunken library, logical indexer, and reclaimed stillness with freshness. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the ink stamp and Aldric's revelation. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
