<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's steadily curious nature is embodied through concrete actions like measuring and card reading, driving the narrative; her internal consistency and the architect's earned transformation show micro-choices under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with closure as a conceptual repricing—the architect's realization of hubris and Mara's web metaphor reconfigure meaning; cost is legible in his whispered understanding and the final image of rain as a metronome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices—the measuring tape anchors abstractions, the skylight mirrors the flooded city—and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in multiplying paths, tightening stakes around cultural mapping; cost is legible in the architect's trembled hands and hubris, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of web vs. chain emerges through events and imagery without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the cards and tape, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV from Mara is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, dialogue carries subtext, and elision (e.g., card meanings) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "crystal of a broken economy") but no artifacts obscuring closure; sentences advance momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy and cultural analysis offers a fresh angle on post-crash society; risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
