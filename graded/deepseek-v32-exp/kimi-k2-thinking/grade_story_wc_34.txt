<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to articulate the ghost's needs is clear and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion in lines like "her voice rose, a tinkersong wonder." However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the characterization leans toward consistent reactivity rather than deep flaw-complication, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the ghost is freed and the song endures, carrying felt cost in the balladeer's vanishing. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns like the glyphs and bolt plate use building coherence. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and causality flows seamlessly from encoding to liberation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the misty courtyard and bolt plate actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "shimmering glyphs" and "swirled mist" are purposeful and POV-filtered, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental without deepening tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the balladeer's agency, with encoding and singing intensifying to free the ghost, and cost is legible in her disappearance. The dominant stake of articulating unspoken needs tightens meaningfully through density increases, though the escalation lacks a sharp causal turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ghost's code and graffiti roses, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on voice and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication in actions and imagery, such as the bolt plate glowing as a key, and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "tinkersong wonder" and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues; the prose's texture consistently reflects the balladeer's mindset, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing multiple layers like "the walls bloomed with graffiti roses, each petal a cipher." No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of ghost, code, and graffiti art, feeling inevitable and heightening stakes through specific, risk-taking lyricism. The core premise is transformed via grounded details like the flower press bolt plate, and the closure image resists generic templates with authentic vision.</comment>
