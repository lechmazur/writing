<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses (caution vs. release) acting in scene; the final choice to grieve is earned by prior causality with visible cost in tears and vial opening. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (transformation from archivist to mourner) with felt cost (tears, released perfumes) under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with grief as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (greenhouse, vial) constrains choices (UV revealing, uncorking) and charges the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV, with micro-setting (vial, Nightshade) altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (using UV lamp, opening vial) with unmistakable cost (tears, emotional release); dominant stake (internal grief) tightens through sensory density and memory triggers, foreclosing avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and memory emerges through events and images (vial, Nightshade) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("grief was love with nowhere left to grow") that reweights prior material, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature (lyrical, sensory-focused); voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; purposeful elision (e.g., memory triggers) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is cohesive and supports peak beats without muddling clarity, e.g., "grief was love with nowhere left to grow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in a specific, non-obvious synthesis (lantern broker, extinct plants, UV revealing) that feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through grounded detail.</comment>
