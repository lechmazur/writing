<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority shown through copper veins and sensory translation. The final choice to leave the diamond as a memorial is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her observation of spinebirds leading to a micro-choice that drives the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the diamond's endless singing reconfigures meaning beyond understanding. Cost is legible in her failure and death, and the lens holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "fossilized thunder" and "bone-white wings" filtering through POV. The bone tower and canyon constrain choices and charge the final image, as the tunnel of echoes amplifies the translation. Micro-setting elements like the diamond and copper veins are integral to tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the language escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as she harnesses spinebirds' patterns to translate texture. Cost is unmistakable in her failure and oxidative death, narrowing options and foreclosing paths. Pressure coheres and tightens with a meaningful deepening at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring persistence beyond meaning through the diamond's song and the storyteller's translation. Subtext operates in the curse as memory, not malice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping. The narrator's way of noticing is character-specific, such as interpreting spinebirds' flight as syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "copper humming, like birds thinking." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the translation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of elements like copper veins, spinebirds, and stone-tongue, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in surreal world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme.</comment>
