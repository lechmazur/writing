<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve lost songs is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown in lines like "his voice cracking like the dry pages below." Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure, such as releasing pigeons and balancing on the beam. The final trust and release feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the preservation of echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the preservation of echoes, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of dust motes, pigeons, and meteorite builds cohesively, taught early and paid off at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reweighting options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "smelled of old paper and rain" and "skylight's beam" filtering through POV. The attic and dust motes constrain choices and charge the final image, as seen when Elias maps patterns to seek melodies. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving echoes escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases in pattern breaks, such as mapping dust and releasing pigeons. Agency drives escalation, with cost legible in the emotional weight of "fragile trust" and the final pigeon release. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and trust emerges through events and images like the meteorite chip and paper trails, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "fleeting constellation of hope," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as dust motes mapping lost melodies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature in lines like "dust motes swirled, a map of invisible currents." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control is maintained under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language like "wings a soft shout" is coherent and purposeful. Clarity and propulsion are maintained, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of pigeon training, meteorite, and dust mapping, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choices.</comment>
