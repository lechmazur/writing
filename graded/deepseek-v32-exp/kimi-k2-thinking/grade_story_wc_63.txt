<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her precise nature; her internal conflict between erasing or honoring Marten's truth is embodied and earns the final choice with visible cost in the redistribution of burden. Micro-choices under pressure, like pocketing the handle, reveal her values hierarchy. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; closure choice is causally earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as the tower stones settle into alignment; causal-accumulative lens holds strong from discovery to winding. Orientation is clear within 120 words; Marten's inscriptions drive the turn, and the persistent constraint of the pendulum's pause shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "the weight she'd carried... began to redistribute."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tidal obsidian ridge pressuring choices via the returning tide and the pendulum's swing constraining time. Sensory details like "crunching black glass" and "salt spray" are selective and POV-filtered. The ridge and bob charge the final image; no generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency in discovering inscriptions and making a choice, tightening options under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the tower's alignment and her shifted winding approach. No coincidence; resolution earned through protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from particulars like the inscriptions and tide marks; subtext operates in gestures and images. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. No thematic echo or abstraction; earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and precise, e.g., "measuring absolution in ticks and tocks." Rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression in the pendulum's pause. No head-hopping or register drift; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, e.g., "her boots crunching black glass that sang." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Clarity and concision maintained even in peak beats like the realization scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time, guilt, and absolution feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific details like the rake handle inscriptions. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Non-obvious angle with emotional specificity; no derivative premise or hedging.</comment>
