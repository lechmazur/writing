<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's interior conflict between pacifism and secret shame is embodied and drives micro-choices; her final renunciation to stay is earned by the stitching process, with cost legible in "ecstatic with the terrible beauty of integrated grief." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya chooses to stay, with cost felt in her transformed purpose. Orientation is clear early, and causality links guilt, gravity, and stitching to the dimension opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting ("recycled spaceship," "observation deck") constrains choices (e.g., warp core needle) and charges the final image; sensory details like "stars hung like unanswered prayers" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under hybrid lens is driven by Maya's agency in stitching photographs, integrating shadow self; cost is unmistakable in gravitational changes and her decision to forgo entry, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as absorbed violence emerges through particulars like stitching and the final image; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, e.g., "edges curled like grief itself," and rhythmic control under pressure supports clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "molecular tape" is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of AI pacifism, shadow work, and sci-fi is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in spiritual-mechanistic fusion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is untouched.</comment>
