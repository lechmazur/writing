<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing glyphs. The final renunciation of safety for vigilance is earned by prior causality, but interior contradiction is minimal, limiting higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the risk of being trapped and the secured seeds, under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices, such as gravity inversion revealing alcoves, and the prism as a micro-setting constrains tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in the time-bound race. The dominant stake of protecting archives tightens meaningfully, though the inversion hour resolves somewhat conveniently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance emerges through particulars like the seeds and prism, with subtext in the "latent blaze." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but depth is slightly limited by narrative efficiency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in poetic observation. No head-hopping or dialogue, and elision (e.g., threshold effects) is taught and paid off, though rhythm is occasionally uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes originality with specific details like gravity inversion and prism use, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors the arc.</comment>
