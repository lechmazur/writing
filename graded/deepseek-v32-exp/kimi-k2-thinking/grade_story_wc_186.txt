<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; however, internal conflict is minimal, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) and felt cost in the light's renewal and travelers' approach; accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern-driven causality; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass humming pavilion and prism constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the beacon's rekindling and convergence of travelers, foreclosing isolation with hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on coincidence and repair; subtext operates through silence and light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature tied to retrocognition; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation of tropes is grounded.</comment>
