<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to crystallize safety is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like powdering the mask. Interiority is concrete, but occasional abstract phrasing ("mirage of safety solidifies") slightly undermines peak beats. Final endurance of illusion's cost is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with motif-driven escalation to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara accepts ephemeral safety. Closure cost is legible in "somber marvel that even illusions can be beautiful." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and structure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (gallery, rocking chair) constrains choices and charges the final image with sensory specificity ("ash feels soft, a fine dust"). POV-filtered details like "vanishing point pulls at edges of vision" mirror internal states without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallizing safety) escalates under accumulative lens through Elara's agency in powdering the mask, deepening with cost legible in her acceptance of illusion. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through particulars (ash, mask) without direct statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "somber marvel." Subtext operates in images like "ash clinging to her palms."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction ("room exhales a ghost of cedar"). Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; elision (incomplete information) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("shimmer, a somber marvel") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Propulsion maintains momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (ash scatterer, porcelain mask) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric mode that heightens stakes. Specificity in emotional truth ("fragile narrative") avoids template plots.</comment>
