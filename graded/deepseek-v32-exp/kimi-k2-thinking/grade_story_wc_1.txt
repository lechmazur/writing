<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation shifts credibly from vengeance to purpose, embodied in micro-choices like studying frost and shaping glass. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in the throbbing wound and resonant heartbeat. The final renunciation of vengeance for art is earned by prior causality, though some emotional beats lean slightly told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael's purpose crystallizes in the glass vessel, costing his former path. Hybrid lens holds: causal linkages (frost patterns to ledger) blend with accumulative texture. Orientation is clear within 120 words; cost is legible in the "weight of responsibility" and "quiet promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: the canyon's maze enables escape, and frost patterns dictate navigation. Sensory details are vivid and selective (frost "glittering like shattered glass"). The furnace as micro-setting charges the final image, shaping Kael's transformative act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under hybrid lens: stakes tighten from survival to legacy discovery, driven by Kael's agency in decoding frost and using the furnace. Cost is unmistakable in the ledger as "weight of responsibility" and foreclosed vengeance. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the vessel embodies "purpose in the pauses" without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like glass capturing starlight. Ending reweights prior material—frost patterns and scorched testament—into a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye for patterns and light). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating under pressure. No dialogue, but elision (e.g., frost code revelation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops. Figurative language ("river of light") enhances clarity. Minor scaffold in repetitive "purpose in the pauses" phrase, but no closure obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry, smuggling, and inheritance feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (ledger as map, furnace as legacy). Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
