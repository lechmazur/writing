<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with interior contradictions shown through her struggle between assumptions and discarding them. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, leading to an earned renunciation with visible cost in her practical relief. The final choice is causally rooted in prior beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot structure under the Accumulative/Textural lens builds density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the shard's true nature as a seed reweights the premise. Cost is legible in Mira's weeping as "a pressure release valve," and the lunar perigee constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the tower city and gorge pressuring choices through gravity and isolation. The shard and tools function as micro-settings that constrain Mira's actions and charge the final image of transformation. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her professional bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through Mira's agency in discarding assumptions, narrowing options and leading to a cost-legible climax. The dominant stake of finding truth deepens into a reconfiguration of purpose, with the final tone embodying a "fundamental frequency of beginning" that forecloses her prior path with relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events, with the "beginning in every ending" concept resonating through the shard's transformation into a seed. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights silence as presence, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the tears as "practical" and the rewiring as a pattern of patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature through Mira's poetic yet practical lens, with rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and single, with elision taught early (e.g., "ghost frequencies") and paid off at closure. Diction remains within her lexicon, and syntactic variety supports emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "silence made tangible" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level craft accelerates with scene needs, and the final image lands with resonant specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh, inevitable whole through specific details like the "shard of hush" and the tower's transformation. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept commits fully to its implications, resisting generic templates.</comment>
