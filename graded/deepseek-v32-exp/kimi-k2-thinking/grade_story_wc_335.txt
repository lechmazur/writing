<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archivist's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, walking backwards), and her final choice to stay is earned by prior causality with Lin. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her desire for freedom versus mentorship, revealing a hierarchy of values. Minor slip: occasional diagnostic language like "combative tenderness" is stated but dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with Earned Stasis as archivist chooses to remain, foreclosing exile with visible cost (freedom sacrificed). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The final image of the swing and library breathing reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the library pressures the archivist's exile and tools like the teapot and glass shard charge the final annotation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the "moss-covered stone" and "marble floor," woven through action. The playground swing recurs to mirror thematic resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens through the archivist's agency in annotating the shard and interacting with Lin, narrowing options. Cost is legible when she spills tea and chooses mentorship over freedom. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the stake shift is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through particulars like the tea leaves and swing, without moralizing. Subtext operates in dialogue ("bend, not break") and the final image offers a non-literal answer. Minor hairline slip: "combative tenderness" is slightly overt but integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, such as the archivist's focus on fragments and shadows. Voice is poetic yet consistent, and dialogue with Lin carries subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story. Minor artifact: slight ornate phrasing in peaks (e.g., "combative tenderness") but no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Clarity and momentum maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like reversible exile and tea leaf geometry feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the archivist's choice charges the ending.</comment>
