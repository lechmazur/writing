<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concretely embodied (e.g., regret as "a stone in my throat"), and contradictory impulses (scavenging vs. soaring) drive micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—weaving fragments—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ghost's fade and the protagonist's step forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (negotiated peace) with cost legible in the ghost's fading and the protagonist's altered stance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of fragments teaches its logic early, paying off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (kinetic lagoon, carousel) pressures choices by supplying narrative fragments and constraining action. The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting, charging the final image through its spin and talismanic role. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency—collecting fragments, spinning the wheel, stepping toward the ghost—with cost unmistakable in the weight of regret and the ghost's conditional gift. One meaningful tightening (child's fragment) deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through fragmented memory emerges organically from particulars (e.g., child's voice, camera wheel) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of weaving narratives, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, fragmented syntax reflecting chronological confusion). Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., rhythmic camera clicks), and any elision (e.g., ghost's speech) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language (e.g., "fractured stillness") is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats. No register drift or clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes surreal setting and internal ghost negotiation with specificity; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The fusion of eroded ambitions and fragmented memory feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
