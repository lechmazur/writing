<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling the seed's "encoded potential" and the "thrill of linguistic subversion." His dual identity and rebellion are earned, with contradictions acting in scene, and the final defiance is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring stakes as defiance flares brighter after auditors leave, with cost felt in the ongoing risk. The causal lens holds tightly, with events like the seed planting leading directly to the auditors' arrival and thwarting. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of surveillance shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "humid heart" and "jewel-toned beetles." It pressures actions, such as using the mangrove for dead drops, and integrates seamlessly with the plot and character priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from the auditors' arrival to their defeat via Aris's coded language, with cost legible in the heightened risk and defiance.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the gourd vine as a "vow" for freedom, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to thought control without moralizing. Subtext operates in coded dialogue and natural metaphors, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in botanical and entomological lexicon, evident in lines like "the lexicon of lateral vines."
