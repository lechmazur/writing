<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "clutched the antique watch fob." Final choice to use the recorder is earned by prior false starts, showing credible struggle and micro-choices. Contradictory impulses act in scene when she shifts from force to cunning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words. Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from attempts to climax. Closure is a decisive change: capturing the sound preserves the truce with felt cost in the final image, e.g., "trust, once broken, can be measured."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, e.g., "rotting pier stretched into the black water," with sensory details filtered through POV. The pier and watch fob as micro-setting constrain choices, charging the final image by enabling the compartment discovery. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the truce) escalates through protagonist's agency under causal lens, from false starts to successful recording. Cost is legible on-page: she carries "the sound of trust breaking" as a tangible price. Escalation tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust and betrayal emerges implicitly through events and images, e.g., the watch fob and captured sound. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "trust, once broken, can be measured in the smallest of sounds." Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "raised on the rhythm of clandestine footsteps." Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the watch fob's discovery paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "its timbers slick with salt and the memory of old fish." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story momentum. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pirate market and literary concept feels inevitable; the "truce of hush" and capturing sound are fresh inflections. Risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details transform familiar tropes.</comment>
