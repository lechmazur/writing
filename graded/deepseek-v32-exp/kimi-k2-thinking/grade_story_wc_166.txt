<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to pen a cosmic verse is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her choice of elective exile. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like brushing the moonstone dust, though contradictory impulses are minimal. The final choice to write on her skin is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her anchored state and release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Lyra stepping beyond the garden, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting memory and defiance with felt cost. The lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The moonstone dust inciting incident and subsequent beats cohere without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden constrains choices by anchoring Lyra and supplies resources like silences as ink, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through her POV, with the garden evolving from a place of memory to a canvas for her verse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as her choice to observe gaps and write the verse deepens the stake against the nostalgia ban. Cost is legible in her temporary anchorage and the transformative release, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like gaps between stars and the cosmic verse, offering a non-literal answer to memory's persistence without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, such as her dance whispering defiance, and the ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical and rhythmic under pressure. Voice is coherent, and purposeful elision (e.g., learning the void's language) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting risks exist in peak beats (e.g., "cosmic verse on mortal skin" repetition), but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements like tide dancer and elective exile feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical structure that heightens stakes. Specific details (moonstone dust, obsidian grace) avoid tropes, and the closure transforms prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
