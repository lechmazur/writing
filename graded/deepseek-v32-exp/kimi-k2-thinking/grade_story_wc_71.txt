<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, driving the protagonist's actions, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, with some stock phrasing like "secret prayer" reducing impact. The final realization that work is a shared secret is earned, but character remains somewhat one-note without significant internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with closure as a conceptual repricing—the act of noticing sanctifies the world—landing with cost in the houses' humming and town's change. Orientation is clear early, and structure builds through repeated object placements, though causality is light due to the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "quiet bay" and "streetlights daydream," selectively filtered through POV to support tone and theme. The environment constrains choices, as seen with the orris root shard placement, charging the final image of the hushed blaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in sanctification acts, tightening the stake of making houses feel alive. Protagonist agency in placing objects drives deepening, with cost legible in houses exhaling and humming, though no major reversal narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence and sanctification emerges organically through images and actions, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the hushed blaze reweighting prior material, though some repetition of motifs like "shard of hush" slightly dampens freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature in noticing "displaced objects." Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, though dialogue is absent and not required.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and high information density, but minor artifacts include repetitive phrasing like "hushed blaze" and template cadence in object listings, though clarity at closure remains unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing noticing with sanctification through specific objects. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable, though it echoes familiar magical realism tropes without full transformation.</comment>
