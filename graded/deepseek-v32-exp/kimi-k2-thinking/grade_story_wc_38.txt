<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to dance 'liberate' is earned by prior causality, showing vulnerability encoded as strength with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (escape) and cost (transformation of dice from terror to triumph). The causal drive lens holds throughout, with the dice and dance creating a coherent chain of events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "flickering diodes" and "taste of iron" integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the causal lens, with each dance step tightening options toward freedom. Cost is legible in her survival and the reconfiguration of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery (e.g., spider web, dance), offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in vulnerability becoming strength enriches the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Lyra's mind. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., dance as code) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story with clear propulsion, especially in peak beats like the final dance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of dance as code in a sunken lab is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
