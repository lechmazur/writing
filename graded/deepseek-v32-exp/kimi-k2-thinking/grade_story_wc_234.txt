<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist's motivation to capture the density of presence is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like creating the vial. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and the relationship with Kael acts as a crucible, forcing a revaluation. However, some emotional beats rely on abstract phrasing (e.g., "feeling the density of presence thicken"), slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the vial crystallizes presence, charged by the ember nexus's glow and the secret's weight. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the "new resolve crystallizing" and the sealed vial. The drive lens holds consistently, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember nexus setting constrains choices by providing the context for the alchemical act and charges the final image with its "pulsed" approval. Sensory details like "ember glow" and "shimmering dust" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the alchemist's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with objects like the shell and vials integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens occurs through the alchemist's agency in mixing the shell with pigments, deepening the stake of presence capture. The cost is visible in the "weight of that promise" and the sealed vial, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres from the whispered secret to the luminescent curl, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the revaluation of the shell and the act of returning differently, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "Presence is the only treasure." Subtext operates in gestures like Kael's hand over hers, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and romantic diction. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the secret and revaluation. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression in peaks like "each heartbeat a star." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors (e.g., "each breath a galaxy"), but no loops or scaffold issues harm clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, cosmic imagery, and philosophical inquiry feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the palette of resolve. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure image of the vial as a "beacon of presence" is singular and cohesive.</comment>
