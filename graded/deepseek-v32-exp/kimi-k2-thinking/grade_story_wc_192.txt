<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deep with embodied emotion and credible growth; the shadow keeper's internal conflict between isolation and connection drives the narrative, and her final choice to teach breathing is earned through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the sanctuary's transformation from emptiness to shared life; the fading threshold pulses with possibility, and cost is legible in the memory of breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices; the ashen sanctuary and starlight atmosphere pressure the shadow keeper's actions, and recurring objects like the doorknocker ring charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the man's encroachment forcing a choice to rebuild bridges; cost is unmistakable in the sanctuary's thrumming shared life and the fading threshold's pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in shadows and breathing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "Breathing is a bridge we build" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature that reflects the shadow keeper's bias; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision enhance clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, advancing story and character with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of bridge-burning and rebuilding, with emotional specificity and risk-taking in the poetic style; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
