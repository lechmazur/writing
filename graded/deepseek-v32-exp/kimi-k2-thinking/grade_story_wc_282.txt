<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority occasionally slips into abstraction, such as "grief was a transitional object," which feels diagnostic and reduces embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds effectively to a charged poise closure where Lira's transformation is felt, with the fossil as a key constraint; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "walls wet with salt and memory" create a rich atmosphere, and the setting actively shapes Lira's journey and charges the final image through the cave's network.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Lira's agency, culminating in her decision to sing, which reweights the narrative with cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past and present emerges organically through the fossil and Lira's actions, with subtext in emotional mapping, avoiding moralizing for resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is consistently poetic, reflecting Lira's role, though occasional abstraction may slightly distance the reader without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose maintains momentum, but occasional abstract phrases like "transitional object" risk slight muddle in peak beats, though no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of emotion mapping in a hibernated world is innovative, and the fusion of science and mysticism through the fossil feels organic and transformative.</comment>
