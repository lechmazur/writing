<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistently drives her choices; her realization that the stone alone is insufficient and subsequent decision to harmonize the cave's resonance is an earned micro-choice under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling vibrations in her chest, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized. The final endurance and readiness for future storms foreclose a path with visible cost (stone dims), scaled to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (bloom of hush) and resonant reconfiguration (cyclical silence understood), with cost legible in the stone dimming and storm pausing. Causal lens holds tightly from failure to alignment, and the persistent constraint of the cave's resonance shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure follows Track A defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the harmonic caves and ice patterns constraining choices (e.g., crack examination dictates alignment method) and charging the final image of silence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's expertise, though other senses beyond visual/tactile are underutilized. The environment acts as a micro-setting that pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens: initial failure with the stone forces a tactical shift to harmonizing the cave, narrowing options and increasing cost (stone's dimming). The dominant stake (finding quiet) tightens meaningfully, and the cost is unmistakable in the silence achieved and energy beings pausing. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a presence emerges organically through events and images (e.g., bloom of hush as cyclical), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Lira's readiness, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the cave's resonance and stone's evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "hammered repose") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., legend of bloom) is taught and pays off at closure. Voice remains consistent, and prose reflects Lira's mindset without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language (e.g., "silence blossomed like a flower") is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of energy beings and harmonic caves feels inevitable, with specific details (e.g., crack patterns as maps) transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the concept integrates fully with character and closure.</comment>
