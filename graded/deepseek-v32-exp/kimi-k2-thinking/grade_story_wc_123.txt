<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from observation to defiance. His internal conflict between fear and resolve is embodied in micro-choices like the rooftop escape and pigeon release. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in "solitary yet resolute." However, some motivation ("nurture integrity in solitude") is stated rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as Elias's resolve crystallizes, cost felt in "mark him as a target." Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages (followed → lateral escape → message send). Orientation is clear early, and the quarantine zone as persistent constraint shapes tactics. Minor elision in how the message's recipient is handled doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: rooftops demand sure footing, the courtyard offers sanctuary for the pivotal message send. Sensory details (slick tiles, rustling fig leaves) are selective and POV-filtered. The brass tube as micro-setting evolves in use, reinforcing theme without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety) escalates under causal lens via Elias's agency: being followed forces lateral escape, leading to message send with cost ("target"). One meaningful tightening occurs as the storm's eye revelation redefines options. However, the stakes lack visceral immediacy in the chase sequence, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: the pigeon's flight embodies "truth will find its way," and the courtyard's tranquility contrasts bureaucratic secrecy. Subtext operates in the storm's eye note and Elias's solitude. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—precise, observational diction mirrors Elias's obsession. Elision (e.g., pigeon's recipient) is purposeful and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during reflection. Minor register consistency in "layered tranquility" slightly limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing multiple roles (e.g., "tiles were slick" sets atmosphere and risk). No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is controlled. One minor paraphrase loop ("after being followed home" repeated) costs -0.2, but clarity at closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes dystopian mystery with a solitary truth-seeker in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details (storm data, pigeon messaging). Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. The integration feels inevitable, though not wholly unprecedented.</comment>
