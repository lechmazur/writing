<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between carnival and corporation is embodied and drives choices; her orderly intuition is shown through pattern recognition and graffiti encoding, with the foundation stone chip as a concrete anchor. The final determination is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the ongoing battle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under a causal lens, as the community adapts and Mira's hope turns to determination, with cost legible in the "defiant roar" against privatization. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through graffiti actions leading to secret meetings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "lights dancing on blackwater," and the foundation stone chip charges the final image by reminding of fragility. The carnival environment pressures choices through graffiti and spatial constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from first mural to final phoenix, narrowing options and raising stakes with cost legible in the community's readiness. Dominant stake against privatization is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance and memory emerges through images like the phoenix and stone chip, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in graffiti encoding and Mira's dual allegiance, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's poetic observations, such as "paint smelled of turpentine and hope." Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "fireflies on a liquid sky" is coherent and advances momentum, though slightly dense in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements like raft city carnival and graffiti resistance with inevitable hindsight; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
