<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Collective characterization is handled well with embodied emotions and shared motives, but lacks individual interior conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The ghost's altruism is consistent, and the community's final action is earned through prior causality, though the collective POV limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with clear closure as the ghost fades, leaving a spiral that reconfigures hope with felt cost. Orientation is sharp early, and causality is tight, though the plot is straightforward without major twists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with floating rock arches and butterfly garden constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and woven through action, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—saving the orchard—and escalation is driven by collective agency using the bell, with cost legible in the ghost's departure. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but pressure is gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective resilience emerges organically from events and images, with the spiral offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the ghost's actions avoids moralizing, though it leans slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and distinct, with stable third-person omniscient POV focused on the community. Lyrical rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language enhances clarity, and momentum is maintained through selective, vivid detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost caretaker and orchard planet feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific setting and stakes. Risk-taking in collective POV heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
