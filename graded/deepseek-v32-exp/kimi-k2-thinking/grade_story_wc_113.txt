<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in her hesitation and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to play the last note is earned by prior causality, showing internal conflict and visible cost in the dissolution of the program and ghost's departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot escalates through patterned note-playing, leading to a conceptual repricing closure where Mara understands the ghost's desire to be remembered. Cost is legible in the program's dissolution and lanterns' extinction, with orientation anchored early in the flooded pit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns constrict choices and charge the final image, with water damage and submerged architecture shaping Mara's tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on unraveling the code and freeing the ghost, escalating through Mara's agency in playing notes that disrupt equilibrium. Each note narrows options and increases cost, culminating in a final trade-off that forecloses paths with visible consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and art emerges through subtext and wordless conversation, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reweighting the in-between spaces as filled with possibility, rooted in concrete particulars like the dissolved program.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, controlled rhythmic prose under pressure, and purposeful elision in the wordless conversation. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with sentence-level rhythm accelerating in step with scene needs, and no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and musical code feels inevitable, with specific details like water damage creating images transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure recharges prior material.</comment>
