<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion like "Her heart beat in tune with the hum of distant trains." Her motivation to find where unused love is stored drives the narrative, and her final realization and release of love feel earned by prior causality. However, minor abstraction in phrases like "a vault of unused love" slightly reduces immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with cost as Mira realizes "love unused was love preserved, not lost" and feels healed, dissolving the memory wound. The lens holds consistently, with pattern and density escalating to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "Fog curled around iron rails" filtering through Mira's POV. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, as the "viaduct's blooms seemed to breathe with her" and the setting sighs in response to her release of love. Micro-setting elements like the blooms and crystal lens actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake in finding and releasing unused love escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency, such as breathing changes that alter perception and draw sparks near. Cost is legible on-page as "the wound of memory dissolved" and love flows back, foreclosing the path of stored emotion. One meaningful tightening occurs when her breathing reveals the hidden chamber, deepening options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the camera obscura capturing "luminous truth within shadows," without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's realization that love is stored within, reweighting prior material like the past life memory. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature from Mira's artist perspective, e.g., "Each breath she took altered the shadow play." Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure, as in "She breathed them in, allowing them to fill her chest." No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; experimental elements like lyrical compression are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds or loops. Figurative language like "ghostly whispers" is purposeful and coherent, though minor overwriting in peaks slightly reduces clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with no artifacts harming closure; read-aloud test passes with natural modulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of concepts like camera obscura artistry and pilgrim of sparks, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the closure image of released love transforms familiar themes. Specific, verifiable details anchor universals, avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
