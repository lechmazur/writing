<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's frugality and empirical mindset are consistent and drive his patience-led investigation; his motivation to preserve knowledge against regime change is clear and intensifies, compelling his final action. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses, and emotional embodiment is somewhat abstract, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the tile's vanishing and dispersed knowledge; causal lens holds tightly from discovery to activation, with the between-regimes timeframe persistently constraining tactics. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the palace observatory and tile constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) escalates under causal lens through Kael's agency, culminating in a decisive activation with cost; tightening is meaningful but agency slightly passive in climax, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns outlasting regimes emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via cosmic indifference; subtext is rich, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical yet empirical, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature; no dialogue, but elision and compression are taught and legible, though minor register elevation in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and elegant with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in climax, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with specific details transforming tropes; risk-taking in lyrical cosmic theme pays off with inevitability, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
