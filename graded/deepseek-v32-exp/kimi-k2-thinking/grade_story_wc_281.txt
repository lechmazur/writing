<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's affectionate skepticism is concretely embodied through contradictory impulses (eye-rolling vs. willowglass hope), and her final softened stance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the somatic marker flare. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (willowglass hope brightening), under a Hybrid lens that holds. The geode as persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear within 120 words. Causality is tight from static shock to resonance mapping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio and geode function as micro-setting that constrains choices (metal table for chemicals) and charges the final fractal tree image. Sensory details (acetone smell, fluorescent buzz) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lina's agency under the Hybrid lens, from devising the plan to mapping pathways, with cost legible in her changed stance and the geode's disruptive potential. Dominant stake (unraveling recall mystery) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (geode patterns, somatic markers) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fractal tree image, reweighting skepticism and hope with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("willowglass hope," fractally precise patterns). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., resonance mapping) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor poetic excess ("willowglass hope") doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of geode resonance and somatic markers feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in poetic diction that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of skepticism trope through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
