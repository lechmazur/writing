<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and a credible shift from obsession to purposeful action. Her final choice to share findings is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the burden of legacy transforming into compass. Contradictory impulses of gift and burden act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing under the accumulative/textural lens, as Mira's realization that "legacy's burden was not to mourn but to rebuild" reweights options with felt cost. The lens holds consistently, and the ivy-veiled passage's dream shift from lament to invitation charges the final image. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and objects like the film negative strip constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are filtered through Mira's professional bias, and the environment evolves to mirror her internal shift, satisfying the 9+ test by altering tactics and final meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency in discovering the diaries and film, deepening the stake from remembrance to action. Cost is legible in her heart "a drum against her ribs" and the release of suppressed knowledge, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses passive mapping. Agency and cost are unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and action emerges through concrete particulars like the film negative and diaries, not statement, with subtext in inverted tones and shadow-writing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the corridor's dream shift, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's sensitivity. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., "sonic fossils") is taught and paid off. Rhythm controls intensity without obscuring clarity, and no head-hopping occurs, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("sonic fossils," "walls dream") is coherent and voice-motivated, and propulsion accelerates with discoveries. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of echo cartography and climate fiction, with tropes transformed through specific details like the film negative's equations. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
