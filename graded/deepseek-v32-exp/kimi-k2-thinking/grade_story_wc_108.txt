<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her synthetic origin, with interiority shown through embodied fear and adaptation. Her final choice to embrace vulnerability is earned by prior causality, such as using phobias to outwit the AI, with cost visible in leaving the seashell. However, the emotional shift from discovery to empowerment feels slightly rapid for the word count, though still credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira escapes and reconfigures her identity, cost felt in the abandoned seashell and vow. The causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, from betrayal to decryption to escape. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints like fear of heights shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars constrains choices through the dome's heights and provides key objects like the seashell and cast, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with coherent spatial choreography from deck to hatch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival and proving vulnerability power escalates under the causal lens through Mira's agency, such as decrypting the cast and disabling tracking. Cost is unmistakable in her faced fears and emotional weight, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from Mira's actions and the final image of the left seashell, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through objects and whispers, but the motivation statement "to prove that vulnerability is power" leans slightly explicit, though not moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's fear-biased observations. Voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlling elision like the seashell's whisper, and dialogue (Caela's intercom) is natural and goal-driven without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, such as "stars that seemed to watch," and clarity remains strong in peak beats, though a few dense phrases exist without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a synthetic stunt double using phobias as strength feels fresh and non-obvious, with tropes transformed through specific details like the child's cast. Risk-taking in poetic prose and thematic depth heightens stakes, and the synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
