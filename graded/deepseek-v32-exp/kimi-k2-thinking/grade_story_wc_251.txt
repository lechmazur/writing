<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mr. Hartwin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with micro-choices like leading students to the grotto, but lacks deep internal contradiction or embodied emotion under peak stress, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the city's mindset shifts, cost legible in the 'authorities, puzzled' and the lingering hush; causal lens holds tightly with prophecy discovery leading to organized acts that reconfigure stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the finale—the magnetic grotto hums with energy, drawing neighbors, and the cobalt library's mist carries change; sensory details are selective and purposeful, avoiding clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency from teaching chess to organizing window displays, tightening stakes with visible cost in the authorities' confusion; one meaningful deepening under causal lens, but conflict remains societal rather than personal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through particulars like chess puzzles and the grotto tournament, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in 'the most powerful revolutions are often the quietest' without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor elevation in diction occurs without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., prophecy details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax, but minor figurative overuse (e.g., 'forests of second thoughts') and repetitive stems ('unspoken worries') appear without harming closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes chess and rebellion with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices; risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
