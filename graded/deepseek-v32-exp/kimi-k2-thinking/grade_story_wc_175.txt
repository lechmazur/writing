<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent, driving her micro-choices like knotting her hair to the moth wing. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with no stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the interrupted cadence. However, slight lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the monarch's pause and continued flight. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of temporary structures building to the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the closure unit is legible and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the verdant grotto and cloud pool constraining choices (e.g., the moth wing's discovery). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The environment directly shapes tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring overlooked histories escalates through Esme's agency in responding to the moth wing. Cost is legible in the loss and memory, with one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. The protagonist's actions foreclose paths with visible cost, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and loss emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in temporary structures and the moth wing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, and any elision (e.g., "interrupted cadence") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, though minor overwriting exists without harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ecological loss and memory, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
