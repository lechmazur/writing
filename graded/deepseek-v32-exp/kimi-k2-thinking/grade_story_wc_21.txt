<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority shown through retro-cognitive experiences. Her micro-choices under pressure, like arranging debris during the parley, reveal values. The final renunciation of her trapped state is earned with visible cost, though some emotional beats rely on summary rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as truth is published and Elara is released, under a causal lens. Cost is legible in her final sleep without sand. Orientation is clear early, and the structure with two shards (library and map room) coheres, though the transition is slight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the creaking library and sand in sheets. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the coastal view reinforcing stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Elara's agency, such as the parley and debris arrangement. Cost is legible in the negotiated disclosure. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though the Under-Minister's shift feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges through particulars like the beach debris and diary, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with nuance, as villains and victims wear the same uniform. Subtext operates in gestures and silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature in her retro-cognitive visions. Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue in the parley carries subtext. Minor register consistency in peak beats, but no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, like "drowning in other people's final moments." Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like retro-cognition and zeppelin library synthesize uniquely, transforming tropes through specific stakes. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens meaning without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
