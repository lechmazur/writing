<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is subdued, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, which limits depth. The final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality, but cost feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure lands decisively as the arbor blooms, merging past and future with cost legible in the transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the ashen arbor and moonstone dust constraining Lira's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by Lira's agency in decoding the prophecy and awakening the First Seed. Cost is visible in the seed transformations, though the tightening could be more pronounced under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and prophecy emerges organically through images and actions, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates in motifs like monuments and leaves, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature. Minor repetition in phrasing slightly dulls immediacy, but elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but has minor artifacts, including repeated phrases like "emerges transformed always" and "mossy delight," causing slight momentum drag. However, information density remains high, and closure is unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, with specific details transforming tropes of prophecy and renewal. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with coherence, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
