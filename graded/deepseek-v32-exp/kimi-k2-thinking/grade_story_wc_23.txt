<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as soldering the censer foot into the resonator. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, and the emotional resolution leans slightly tidy, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the tears and peace, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The moon phases and phone calls build causally to the resonant reconfiguration, and the orientation is clear early. The censer foot's weight as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and censer foot constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Kael's POV. Specificity is high, as the environment supplies salvage and the moon phases guide action, making it indispensable to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kael's agency in building the resonator, driven by the moon's waxing and phone calls, with cost legible in his emotional release. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the escalation lacks a sharp tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss and solace emerges through particulars like the censer foot and reverse migration, offering a non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature. The cryptic phone calls and internal monologue are goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language serves the atmosphere, though minor overwriting in peaks like "ghostly light" slightly reduces propulsion. Clarity and concision are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements like the censer foot and reverse migration feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes. Specific details and emotional truth avoid templates, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
