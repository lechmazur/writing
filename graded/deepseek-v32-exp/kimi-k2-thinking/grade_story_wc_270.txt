<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past trauma and quiet rebellion; her plant-telepathy and embodied emotions drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned final decision with visible cost when she retrieves the seed, challenging tradition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Mara unseals the amber and redefines destiny; causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from inciting incident to climax; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with volcanic hot springs and recovering forest pressuring choices (e.g., the hot vent unseals the amber); details like moss-lines and bamboo are POV-filtered and charge the final image of sowing seeds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tradition vs. evolution escalates through Mara's agency in decoding the script and unsealing the amber; cost is legible in societal backlash and the burn risk, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of evolving destiny emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the seed pod representing cultivated hope, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice reflective of Mara's age and plant-connection; perceptual signature is strong, and elision in decoding is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language enhances clarity without muddle, e.g., "the hot springs had given them the tools" supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements synthesize uniquely: grandmother insurgent, plant-telepathy, and amber embryo transform tropes through specific choices; risk-taking in non-linear decoding heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
