<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in mission vs. survival; interiority is concrete under pressure, and her sacrificial choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The final override of instinct demonstrates a hierarchy of values, though the epiphany moment leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and conceptual repricing via Lira's sacrifice; causal lens holds tightly with time pressure constraining tactics. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the vitals flatline and transmitted silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity; the underwater temple and crystal vial function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image of silence. Spatial choreography remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through agency under the causal lens, with time and oxygen pressure forcing higher-cost choices; the helmet crack and sacrifice present unmistakable cost. Dominant stake (harnessing ephemeral) is tightly braided with survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and ephemerality emerges through image and action, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the gathered hush and Lira's transformation into stillness. Subtext operates in silence and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical, rhythmic control; perceptual signature is selective under stress. Elision (e.g., temple dimensions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with high information density; sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs. No loops or scaffolds, though minor figurative density in peak beats doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (gathered hush, quantum core) with specificity; risk-taking in lyrical closure heightens stakes. Transformation of sacrifice trope feels inevitable through grounded choices.</comment>
