<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sensei's motivation is clear and rooted in his ego death, compelling his choice to integrate emotions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as grief stabbing through him, and his final action is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tears, grief) under a causal lens; the plot coheres with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early, with the temporal storm solidifying stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the floating rock dojo's dissolution mirrors internal resolution; sensory details like "formaldehyde swirling like liquid time" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the sensei's agency under the causal lens, with his vivify action narrowing options and incurring legible cost (grief, loss); stakes are dominant and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on integrating emotion; subtext operates in gestures like the brain dissolving into memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in poetic phrasing; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., temporal shifts) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "tears cutting salt trails" is coherent, and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of clone custody and philosophical depth, with turns feeling earned; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is specific.</comment>
