<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to liberate memories is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied patience; her final choice is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as memories spill out and fountains revive, under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the geese pause tightens stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the forgotten fountains and stained glass box constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes to free memories escalate through Kael's sidereal patience and agency; the geese pause forces a decisive action with visible cost in the city's revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and skepticism emerges through concrete events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in the luminous cascade enriches meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., breadcrumbs) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or artifacts; figurative language supports momentum, and peak beats like the latch unclicking are clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like sidereal patience and migrating geese feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
