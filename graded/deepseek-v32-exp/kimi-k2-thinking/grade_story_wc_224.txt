<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in lines like "her past a shard that cut each recollection." Her hesitation and final choice to seed the language show internal conflict and are earned by prior causality, though the emotional depth occasionally leans abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, as the bookstore aligns to spell home, with cost legible in the shaking and transformation. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, supported by the stone's pulse recharging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "air tasted of dust" filtered through Mira's POV. The setting evolves causally, shaping tactics as the corridors rearrange and align at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, as her decision to seed the language narrows options and incurs cost in the hidden thunder's release. The dominant stake of understanding home tightens meaningfully through this choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to home as connections, not place, through the final image of the aligned shelves. Subtext operates in symbols like the feather and stone without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in Mira's mercury-glass eyes and cracked reflections. Voice is consistently poetic, and rhythmic control under pressure is evident, as in the climax where prose accelerates without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purpose-driven, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "silvery memory that burned," but clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fresh elements like the seer and magical bookstore with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.
