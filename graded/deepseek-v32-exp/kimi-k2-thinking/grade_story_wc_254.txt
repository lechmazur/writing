<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The poet's aesthetic drive is consistent and motivates her actions, but internal conflict is underdeveloped; the final merging feels earned but lacks contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost under the Accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the colonnade's hum charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details constrain choices and charge closure, but spatial grounding is occasionally blurred by poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the dissolution of boundaries; one meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext is rich in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and propulsion, but minor figurative muddle in peak beats slightly obscures clarity; no loops or scaffold harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements feels inevitable; poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure remains legible.</comment>
