<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation evolves credibly from estrangement to connection, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., staying on the call, touching the disc). The final choice to shatter the disc is earned by prior causality, though the shift in motivation feels slightly abrupt but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (shattering the disc, breaking the loop) and visible cost (cut palms, unburdened heart). The accumulative drive lens holds through pattern repetition and break, with clear orientation early; the loop's vague origin is a minor flaw but does not undermine causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the tunnel and glass disc charge the final image and shape Mira's actions. Sensory details (e.g., "hum," "stale air") are selective and purposeful, integrated into action without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, with stakes tightening through repeated calls and her decision to break the disc. Cost is legible (physical injury, emotional unburdening), and the pattern break meaningfully reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings and beginnings emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with the final shattered disc offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the calls and disc enriches complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; dialogue is minimal but natural. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though minor ornate phrasing does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the disc shattering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (time loop, haunted object) with fresh specificity through Mira's role and emotional arc. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
