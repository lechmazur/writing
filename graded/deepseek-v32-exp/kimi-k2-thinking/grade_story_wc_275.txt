<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's pacifism and perceptive gift are concretely embodied through micro-choices like offering tea and sheathing the knife, with earned closure in her enduring stance. Internal contradiction is subtle but present in her inheritance of sharp eyes without violence. The final renunciation of violence is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the roses' bloom and quiet vow charge the ending with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of continuity weaves through events without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (e.g., dust storm rattling the dome) and objects like the sandbag scrap and iron disc constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through the stranger's visit and dust storm, with agency in offering quiet and sheathing the knife. Cost is legible in Lyra's renunciation and the roses' resilience, tightening the stake of continuity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of peace and continuity emerges through particulars like the sheathing ritual and engraved quiet, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, resonating in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and clarity is maintained. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pacifism in a post-apocalyptic setting with inculcated plants and engraved quiet feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully integrated.</comment>
