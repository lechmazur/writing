<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her functional creativity and desire for purpose. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions shown through actions like discovering the sextant and rerouting flows. The final choice to resurrect the terminal is earned by prior causality, and her involvement with children adds depth. However, some emotional progression feels slightly idealistic without deeper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, building through Mira's actions with clear cause-and-effect linkages. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the terminal becomes a launchpad for imagination, with cost legible in her effort and the community's renewed wonder. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, supporting the transformative ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like the bruised orange sky and rusted metal, filtered through Mira's POV. The spaceport terminal constrains choices (e.g., using old pipes and solar panels) and charges the final image as a beacon of hope. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving hope escalates through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with meaningful tightening as she reroutes water, harvests energy, and involves the community. Cost is legible in her labor and the terminal's transformation. However, the conflict lacks high-stakes opposition, relying on gradual accumulation rather than sharp reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and hope emerges organically through images like the sextant and redirected flows, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the terminal as a launchpad for imaginations, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Mira's engineer mindset through selective detail and rhythmic prose. Dialogue with children is natural and goal-driven, though brief. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful, and voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "the terminal inhale after decades of apneic stillness" is purposeful and clear. Line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs and concise phrasing supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes engineering and community renewal in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like the sextant and redirected flows. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though some elements feel slightly familiar.</comment>
