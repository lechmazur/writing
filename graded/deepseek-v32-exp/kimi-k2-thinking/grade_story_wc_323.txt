<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her balanced curiosity, compelling her to teach starlight navigation despite its obsolescence. Interiority is concrete, shown through her decoding of light angles and interactions with students. Micro-choices, like using the anchor link as a star map, reveal her values under pressure. The final realization that horizons unfold from within is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the somber marvel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a conceptual repricing where Mara redefines navigation internally. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the anchor link's transformation and students' internal constellations. The elder's intervention tightens the stakes, leading to a resonant reconfiguration without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The benthic city setting pressures choices through its dome and ocean layers, constraining navigation methods. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the corroded anchor chain and bioluminescent tattoos. The anchor link functions as micro-setting, charging the final image by becoming a star map and key to memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning starlight navigation escalates through Mara's agency, such as calculating plankton drift and teaching meditation. Cost is felt in the somber marvel and foreclosed surface dreams. Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens via pattern breaks like the elder's appearance, reweighting options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of expanding perception emerges through particulars like the anchor link's corrosion and edge geometry, not direct statement. Subtext operates in the Tethians' song and students' bioluminescence forming constellations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of internal stars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Mara's professional focus on navigation and poetic observations. Prose rhythm varies naturally under pressure, and dialogue with the elder carries subtext. Elision in starlight method is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "stars in rust" is coherent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in dense descriptions, but clarity remains intact, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of benthic city, alien contact, and starlight navigation feels inevitable, with specific details like edge geometry and plankton drift. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
