<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in postpartum experience; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "beauty rose choking in her throat"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as unfastening her hair, reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of confusion is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the crack as conduit for light reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early in the midnight glade. Cost is legible in the final image of the body as archive, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice (e.g., glade's mist responds to her actions). The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost time) escalates through accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency (unfastening hair, tracing hand). Cost is unmistakable in the realization that she is "both vessel and thief," foreclosing options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lost time as luminous burden emerges organically from particulars like the cracked saucer and tracing custom. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic texture (e.g., "clouds pooled like liquid obsidian"). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Elision in mist and memory is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though some figurative density in peak beats may slightly obscure clarity. No major artifacts or loops; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy, motherhood, and time accumulation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes with unique emotional specificity.</comment>
