<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dye master's motivation is clear and rooted in their post-surgery state, with interiority shown through embodied actions like grinding the morpho wing. The final understanding is earned through the stranger's revelation, but the master's agency in the climax is slightly passive, relying on external intervention for the key turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the master reconfigures their purpose, felt through the donor's memories and the steady heart beat. The accumulative/textural lens holds, though the stranger's arrival feels convenient, slightly weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and blue morpho wing function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "liquid silver" mist and sun trails filtered through the master's POV to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increase in imagery and the stranger's arrival, but the master's agency diminishes at the peak, with the revelation feeling externally triggered rather than fully earned through their actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the morpho wing and donor heart, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about stories being held "in the spaces between beats," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and attention; voice is poetic and consistent, though dialogue is minimal and the stranger's speech edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but occasional figurative stacking ("quietly explosive," "iridescent caution") causes minor register drift without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor heart, morpho wings, and dyeing process feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
