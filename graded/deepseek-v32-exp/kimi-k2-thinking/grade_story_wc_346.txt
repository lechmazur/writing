<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation is clear and rooted in her flawed nature, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, as seen when she places the puppet head, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Interior contradictions, like her role as "the silence between the notes," deepen character without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when the clock stops and the boy sleeps without dreams. Under the accumulative/textural lens, patterns of memory and geometry cohere, taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pane of hush constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse, pane of hush, and clock function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, as when the adjuster traces spirals to send vibrations. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the ocean mirroring all presents. Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vouchsafing peace is signaled early; escalation is driven by the adjuster's agency under the accumulative lens, as she translates desire into geometry. Cost is legible when the puppet head dissolves and she feels "the weight of its absence," narrowing options. Pressure tightens through a single meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty and silence as mercy emerges through particulars like the broken puppet head and nested patterns, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the clock holding "memory of a thousand lullabies," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in the adjuster's poetic, selective noticing. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "bruised awe," without head-hopping. Purposeful compression, like "silence shaped like love," is taught and pays off at closure, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peaks, e.g., "bruised awe of something ending perfectly," slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; syntax varies purposefully to support accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the puppet head as axis. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image recharges prior material. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, e.g., the adjuster's flawed hands writing mercy.</comment>
