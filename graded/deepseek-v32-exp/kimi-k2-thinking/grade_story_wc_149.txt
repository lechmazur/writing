<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or flaws; emotions are embodied (tears, heartbeat sync), yet the final choice feels more plot-driven than character-earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change (orchard rebirth) and felt cost (Elara's grief); causal lens holds tightly from ghost's appearance to bead placement; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (bead's pulse) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the greenhouse and ancient tree constraining Elara's choice; sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of luminescent tendrils and fused bead.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving orchard) escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency in placing the bead; cost is legible in her emotional response, but escalation is mild with no major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of love as poison and cure emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the ghost's voice; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (ghost's fleeting appearances) is taught and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats like the orchard's rebirth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and alchemy feels inevitable; specific details (carved bead, resonant awakenings) transform tropes, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
