<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority; her stoic sensitivity and internal conflict drive micro-choices like snapping the crozier, earning the final renunciation. The cost of her transformation is felt through the frozen blooms and lost crozier, satisfying the quick test for contradictory impulses and earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (frozen undeath, lost crozier) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, which holds consistently. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of family destiny shapes tactics, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus and twilight setting pressure choices through sensory vividness and mirror internal states; the crozier as a micro-setting constrains the climax and charges the final image of frozen blooms, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in her sacrifice of certainty; the cost is legible in the frozen undeath and interrupted destiny, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction and acceptance emerges organically from events and images like the frozen bloom, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through implication and reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., "the penny drops") are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "frozen glass tree" is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and creative destruction feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style and closure heightening stakes; specific details like the crozier's transformation avoid template plots, earning a within-band bonus.</comment>
