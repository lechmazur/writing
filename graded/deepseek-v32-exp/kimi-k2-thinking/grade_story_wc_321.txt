<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied resilience; her micro-choices under pressure, like using the radio and hourglass, reveal a hierarchy of values, though her steadfast positivity lacks contradictory impulses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the temporary merge, under a hybrid lens blending causal and accumulative elements; the persistent constraint of transience shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early with no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the spectral grotto and hourglass constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "damp rail" and "starlight pooling" are integrated through Lina's POV without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in merging timelines escalate through Lina's agency with the radio and hourglass, leading to a legible cost in the temporary resolution; under the hybrid lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of permanence versus transience emerges organically from events and imagery, with subtext in the empty hourglass and starlight; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction like "clocks run sideways" reflecting Lina's perception; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats like the merge sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a vanishing ferry is fresh and transformed through specific details; emotional truth in Lina's resilience and risk-taking with structure create a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
