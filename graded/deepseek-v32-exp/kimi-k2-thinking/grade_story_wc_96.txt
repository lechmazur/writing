<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's internal conflict during the molt approach is embodied in shaky hands, and his choice to keep the voice is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Relationships with Cora force meaningful micro-choices, and motivation to forge beauty from anarchy drives escalating stakes. Contradictory impulses act in scene, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when he chooses to keep the poet's voice and passes the seed-poem, with cost legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by persistent constraints like the coffee tin and library. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "silver ribbons across the rust" filtered through POV. Recurring objects (coffee tin, books) accumulate pressure and meaning. Environment actively shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding the library and spreading resistance, with cost visible in his molt decision. The dominant stake of blooming resistance tightens through density increases, and moral calculus sharpens the peak choice. Agency and cost are unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty forged from anarchy emerges through concrete events like the library rebuild and seed-poem, without moralizing. The final image of the "rusted cathedral" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like passing the coffee tin, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "luminous fracture." Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and dialogue (though minimal) carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "fractured light" is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and closure image is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The molting personalities concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the coffee tin and library rebuild transform familiar tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in poetic style coheres with emotional truth, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
