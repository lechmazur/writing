<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesper's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the mosaic. The final transformation is earned, though internal contradictions are subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the resonant reconfiguration of loss, and the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. The doorway image and fused glass eyes provide a legible before/after shift with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and mosaic stepping stone constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "stalactites wept onto mossy roots" integrated into action. Specificity elevates the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in transforming loss escalate through Vesper's agency with the glass eyes, leading to a cost legible in the "ambiguous loss could never be fully resolved." Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the fractal pattern and doorway, offering a non-literal answer to emotion's mathematics. Subtext in the final transformation avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and varied rhythm without loops or overwriting. Figurative language like "silver droplets into silent music" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotion and mathematics feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details like the glass eyes transform familiar tropes.</comment>
