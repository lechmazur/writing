<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like synchronizing stitches with the candle's rhythm. Her final decision to act is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her dread and the narrowing possibilities. The attribute of disguising wisdom as foolishness enables key choices, such as listening for unheard stories, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Mira stepping into the corridor, guided by the eternal candle, reconfiguring options with undeniable cost. The causal lens holds tightly, with events linked through her actions and the candle's signals. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the plot escalates coherently to the decisive moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory setting constrains choices, such as the candle's flame guiding Mira's stitches, and charges the final image with the candle lighting her path. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with the autumn leaves and echoed silence enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as her stitching reveals the conspiracy and forces her decision to act, with cost legible in the dreaded confirmation and narrowing possibilities. The dominant stake of preventing the coup tightens through her discoveries, and her renunciation of safety forecloses a path with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the flame's whispers and the tapestry's hidden message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and resistance. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent with Mira's perceptual signature, characterized by poetic diction and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. The voice is distinct, with purposeful compression in lines like "each stitch a question posed to the universe," and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "whispered secrets" and "dark constellation," without muddling peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic listening and political conspiracy, transformed through specific choices like embroidery as a method of revelation. Risk-taking in the lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality rooted in character and setting.</comment>
