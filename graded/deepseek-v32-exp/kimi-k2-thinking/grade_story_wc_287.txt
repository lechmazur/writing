<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied, with concrete interiority like the "quivering hush in her ribs" and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the bitting gauge to score soil. Her motivation intensifies from grief to renewal, earning the final choice to plant seeds with visible cost in letting go of the rose. The trait "wistfully pragmatic" constrains actions, showing credible endurance without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya translates grief into planting, with cost legible in "letting go was the most precise measurement." The accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The structure is a seamless two-shard sequence from fire escape to harbor, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the abandoned lot and harbor pressuring choices through tactile details like "concrete still warm from the day's heat." The bitting gauge functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency to plant moonflowers, under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is unmistakable in the foreclosed path of the rosebush, visible in the act of scoring earth. The dominant stake of renewal is signaled early and tightens through her decisive action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the gauge and moonflowers, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images, such as the gauge evolving from "tool of entry" to "invitation." The ending reweights prior material through "turning grief into geometry," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control, e.g., the repeated "rhythm of oars in water" is taught and pays off. The perceptual signature is consistent, with diction matching Maya's perspective. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Purposeful repetition enhances pattern without muddle; no harmful artifacts or loops. Figurative language, like "city held its breath," is coherent and advances momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardening and locksmithing feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific details, such as the gauge's reprise, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
