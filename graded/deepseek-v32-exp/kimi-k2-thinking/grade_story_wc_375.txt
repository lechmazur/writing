<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her mnemonic gift and internal conflict are embodied in actions like tracing faces and tapping the lock. The final choice to draw is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "auroral sorrow." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Elena drawing again) with felt cost ("sorrowful yet promising"); causal lens holds via memory-driven sequence. Orientation is clear within 120 words; lock and memory shape tactics persistently. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cave setting pressures choices (darkness to swallow urge) and charges the final image with crystals humming and light filtering. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered; environment constrains action and supports rebirth theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming creative block) escalates via Elena's agency: lock failure leads to memory-based sequence. Cost is legible in sorrow and renewal; causal lens tightens options meaningfully. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creativity and grief emerges through particulars (lock, painting, charcoal) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in "Draw the dawn"; subtext operates in imagery and implication. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, reflecting Elena's state. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory recall) is taught and pays off. Dialogue absent, so not applicable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high density without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is integrated ("auroral sorrow"). No overwriting or register drift; propulsion supports emotional beats. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize freshly: mnemonic artist, crystal cave, and broken lock transform grief tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric resonance heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
