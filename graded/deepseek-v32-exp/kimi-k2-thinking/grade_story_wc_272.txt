<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority ("ache in her chest was luminescent") and micro-choices (touching threads) that reveal contradiction. The final renunciation of other timelines is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the persistent ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("ache remained... but now she understood it"), under a Hybrid lens that holds. Orientation is anchored early, and the threads' constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("forgotten library... salt and silverfish"), with the threads as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Hybrid lens, as walls close in and threads demand untangling, foreclosing options with cost. Dominant stake (internal conflict) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (threads, light/dark) without moralizing, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("Shadow and light were not opposites but collaborators").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature ("cold fire that lit nothing but its own exhaustion"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing fragmented reality with character arc. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes, and the reweaving of threads feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
