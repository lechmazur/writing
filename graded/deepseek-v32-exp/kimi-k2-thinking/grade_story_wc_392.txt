<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "fortified vulnerability." Her final choice to sever Voss's control is earned by prior causality, such as finding sabotage evidence, and carries visible cost in the confrontation. However, the emotional progression lacks deeper contradiction or irrationality under peak stress, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost when Mara uploads evidence and turns off her phone, foreclosing compliance under the Hybrid lens. Causality is tight, with investigation beats leading logically to the climax. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The subway tunnel and lantern constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "damp gloom" and "rusted rails" filtered through Mara's POV. The lantern's glow recurs to shape atmosphere and legacy, directly influencing her resolve. Specificity is high without ornamental detail, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Hybrid lens through Mara's agency, as empirical observation leads to finding sabotage, narrowing her options. The cost is legible when she ignores Voss's call, sacrificing safety for truth. However, the escalation relies slightly on discovered evidence rather than sustained pressure, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lantern's legacy and Mara's actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "truth would rise like water." Subtext operates through memories and symbols without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material, but the theme echoes slightly overtly in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in Mara's "watchfully calm" demeanor and rhythmic prose under pressure. Dialogue from Voss is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, but minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "entangled memories" is purposeful and clear. However, slight template cadence in descriptions of the lantern and water drops reduces density, though closure remains unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical legacy and modern investigation feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in blending themes. Specific details like the underground railroad symbol transform tropes. Ingenuity is high, as removing any core element would break the story's logic, earning a near-top score.</comment>
