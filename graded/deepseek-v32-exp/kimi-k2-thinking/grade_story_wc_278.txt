<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with internal conflict shown through her realization that the firmware is grieving. Her final choice to unmake the tethers is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the unraveling constellations. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the tattoo needle to transcribe the song, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as constellations unravel and silence falls, with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The plot coheres with causality intact, and the orientation is clear early. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the correction propagates with decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "meteor hush" and "cosmic dust" being selective and purposeful. The amber and phonograph function as micro-settings that pressure Elara's actions, and the environment evolves consistently with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the letters to transcribing the insect's song. The dominant stake of undoing guilt tightens with cost legible in the unraveling constellations and resolved baby cries. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the firmware grieving and the insect's chirp as primal need. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the correction written into reality, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable single with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical voice, and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with the character's lexicon and emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and supports the story, e.g., "constellations unraveling" and "meteor hush." Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and syntax accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like constellation tattooist and haunted firmware, transformed via specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
