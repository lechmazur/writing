<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Negotiator's motivation is clear and rooted in redemption, with interiority shown through embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the shift to collective redemption is earned. Minor stock phrasing in "weight like a stone" slightly reduces specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as redemption shifts to collective will, felt cost in "weight shift." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern of ritual and celestial imagery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice through the ceremonial circle and solstice light, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated with action. The terrace and clipboard function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by negotiator's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "weight shift" and collective trust. Dominant stake of peace tightens through the ritual challenge. One meaningful deepening occurs with the clipboard's hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and collective will emerges through ritual and imagery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the "flawed beauty" ending. Subtext operates in the clipboard's glow and planetary alignment, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with subtext in the veteran's challenge. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of peace negotiation with ritual and celestial elements feels inevitable. Specific details transform tropes, and risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative echoes in redemption arc.</comment>
