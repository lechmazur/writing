<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Elias's internal conflict is shown through twitching fingers and cleared eyes, earning his change. Minor rapid resolution in Elias's recovery slightly limits the score, but contradictory impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost—entity departs, Elias collapses—under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is clear early, and causality is rigorous, with Miriam's questions directly causing the entity's confusion. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the dimensional anchor and bell tower constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "stones remembered every possible rain" and silence pooled are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving Elias escalates through Miriam's agency using rhetorical devices and loop pedal, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in Elias's convulsion and the entity's departure. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices, but slight reliance on metaphysical tools limits peak score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence and assumptions emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like painting circles of silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfigured silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Miriam, with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, philosophical voice. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. Elision in rhetorical questions is taught and paid off, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "indigo spread across the air like a shadow cast by doubt" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing exorcism with sound design and rhetorical theory in a non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the loop pedal and silence, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
