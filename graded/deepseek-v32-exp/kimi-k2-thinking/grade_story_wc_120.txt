<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and character-particular. The final choice to conduct the symphony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exhaustion. However, some emotional states are summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, with the nautilus shell shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass spire and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias and supporting atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in exhaustion. The dominant stake (becoming conductor) tightens through her actions, but the pressure could be more sharply defined in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the symphony's creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, and diction remains consistent with the focalizer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no figurative muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a specific synthesis of elements, transforming tropes with grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
