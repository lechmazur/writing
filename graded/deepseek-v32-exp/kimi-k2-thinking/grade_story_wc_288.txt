<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation from isolation to independence is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. The final choice to become a bridge is credible and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (becoming a "weaver of time") and cost is legible. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through her interactions with the sundial and stone circle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tidal library and stone circle constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting Mara's POV. The environment pressures decisions and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake of isolation versus independence. Cost is legible in her transformation, and pressure coheres through discoveries and merging rhythms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the sundial and stone circle, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy and time, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Mara's interiority. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, advancing story without obscuring causality. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing elements into an inevitable arc. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid cliché, and the closure feels earned.</comment>
