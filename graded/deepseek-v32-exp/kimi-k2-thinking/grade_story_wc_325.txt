<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek's claustrophobia and motivation to witness the unremembered are concretely embodied and drive credible endurance under pressure. The final choice to sync with ghostprints is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the seven-second communion. Interior contradiction (fear vs. duty) acts in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, building through dense imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marek bears witness. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the syncing moment and the codex dimming. Tidal timeframe persists as a constraint, shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (facility, cables, moon pool) pressures choices and charges the closure through tactile details like "bulkheads pressed like closing fists." Sensory selection reflects Marek's urgency, with the codex and phase transitions acting as micro-settings that constrain and redefine the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in ghostprint encounters, culminating in Marek's agential decision to sync. Cost is legible in the emotional weight of witnessing and the facility's return to silence. One meaningful tightening forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of corporate erasure versus human remembrance emerges through particulars like the codex and cable echoes, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Marek's witness, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the dark gold fleck.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates under pressure (e.g., "pneumatic sigh" to "glaciers calving"). Purposeful compression in phase transitions is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "trapped stars") risks slight overwriting without muddling. No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance momentum clearly, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undersea cables, electromagnetic ghostprints, and codex tracking feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific lived detail (e.g., gold flecks warming) avoids template plots.</comment>
