<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict and Linden's guarded hope are vividly rendered, with embodied emotions driving the reconciliation; the final choice to step out together is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the shared resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The accumulative build to a charged poise closure is seamless, with the orchard's silence as a persistent constraint; cost is legible in the "shared resonance of a broken chord made whole," and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive and orchard are richly evoked, with the perfume bottle and induced currents constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of reconciliation escalate through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the emotional vulnerability and orchard's loss; one meaningful tightening occurs via the scent release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of imperfect miracles and forgiveness emerge through music and scent metaphors, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "sometimes the song is the apology."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctly lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure; Mira's perceptual signature colors the prose, and dialogue carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats, and each sentence advances character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" premise and use of induced currents for emotional release form a non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
