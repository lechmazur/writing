<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to witness change without judgment is consistently embodied, and their resistance to the regenerative silence's stasis demonstrates credible internal conflict with visible cost. Micro-choices, like activating the origami swan and making the notation, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the character's passivity in observation limits the depth of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the keeper's notation and return foreclose absorption into silence, charged by the contrast between river's change and preserved quiet. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in the anomaly discovery tightening stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the origami swan's use is causally integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the obsidian refuge's absorption of sound and the library's decay frame the keeper's actions, while the regenerative silence actively halts rot, shaping the climax. Sensory details (ozone, cold silk) are selective and purposeful, filtered through the keeper's POV. The origami swan functions as a micro-setting that redefines options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through a cadence shift into the anomalous silence, driven by the keeper's agency in burrowing and resisting stasis. The dominant stake—witnessing vs. preservation—tightens with a visible cost: the keeper's frayed edges are healed but foreclose passive absorption. One meaningful deepening reweights options without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between change and stasis is resolved through the keeper's etched symbol, a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence's restorative yet tempting embrace, and the final image resonates with conceptual cost against entropy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the keeper's loose grip on reality. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure (e.g., "sinking through solidified honey"). Purposeful compression in the burrowing sequence is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("like ink on wet parchment") is consistent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and the closure image is sharp. Read-aloud test passes with seamless momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chronicle keeper, origami swan, and regenerative silence feels inevitable and fresh, transforming observation tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual integrity.</comment>
