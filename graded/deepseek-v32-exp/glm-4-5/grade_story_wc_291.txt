<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's face-blindness and methodical nature are consistently portrayed, driving her actions and the resolution. Her motivation to awaken empathy is clear and rooted in her traits, though emotional depth in peak moments is slightly summarized rather than fully embodied. The final choice is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in community closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a decisive change (confession and community closure) under a causal lens, felt cost in awakened empathy. Orientation is clear early, and the ribbon fragment initiates a logical chain of investigation. Persistent constraint of face-blindness shapes tactics, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The quarry setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like mist and light enhancing tone. However, it functions more as backdrop than a constraint on choices; the ribbon fragment charges the final image but the environment itself doesn't actively alter tactics or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving the case and awakening empathy) escalates through Elena's agency: measuring the ribbon, calling for documents, and deducing the killer. Cost is legible in the community's closure, and pressure tightens under the causal lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of awakening dormant empathy emerges organically from events and images, such as the quarry's hush and the mask ribbon, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the confession and community closure, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (shapes, textures) and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, but minor convergence in voice at emotional peaks prevents a higher score. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; phrases like "furrowed hush" are evocative without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist and cold case feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the methodical approach and ribbon clue. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure is fully integrated.</comment>
