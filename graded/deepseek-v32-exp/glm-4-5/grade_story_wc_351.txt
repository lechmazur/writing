<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown in moments like "tears mixing with moonlight." The engineer's transformation is earned through prior causality, but internal contradictions are not deeply dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the permanent change and "weight of rediscovered dreams," under a causal drive lens that holds. The broken mirror serves as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the moonlit canyon and broken mirror constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around accessing memories escalate through protagonist agency in activating the device, with cost legible in identity blurring and permanent change. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of abandoned dreams and transformation emerges through events and images like the broken mirror, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that maintains rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts obscuring causality. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of helix-minded engineering and entangled memories, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
