<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to remain hidden but help is earned by prior causality, though the character's passivity slightly limits agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the inferred causal lens holding strong. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, driven by the power outage and tape discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the library and tape fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (helping others) escalates through the tape discovery, driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the trade-off of staying hidden, but conflict remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge preservation and invisibility emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and implications. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, methodical voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm controls pressure well, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language enhances clarity, and read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in quiet storytelling heighten stakes without gimmickry, and synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
