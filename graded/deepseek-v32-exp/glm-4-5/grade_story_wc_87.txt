<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like regret and hope acting simultaneously. Her final shift to self-forgiveness is earned through prior causality, though the phrase "align heart and action" leans slightly diagnostic, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Elena's renewed purpose) and felt cost (compass lightening). Accumulative lens holds through reflective density, and orientation is clear early. Minor deduction for a slight reliance on internal summary over dramatized turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt air, waves) are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elena's POV. The compass charges the final image, but the setting doesn't heavily constrain choices, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) escalates under the accumulative lens through Elena's agency (dolphin encounter triggering release). Cost is legible in the burden's release, though escalation is subtle rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (compass, utility poles) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption, but the concept of "aligning heart and action" slightly edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elena's navigator mindset. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and syntax control under pressure support the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is fluid with varied syntax and high information density. No major artifacts or loops, though minor purple phrasing ("merrily melancholic") slightly impacts peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a broken navigator using utility poles is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. However, it lacks high risk-taking or undeniable inevitability, capping originality.</comment>
