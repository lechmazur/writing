<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is vividly rooted in his defunct revolutionary past and poetic inclination, compelling higher-stakes choices; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "burnished sorrow" and micro-choices under pressure (covering mirrors, writing) that reveal contradiction and earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as the manuscript transforms the dispute, cost is legible in "burnished sorrow" and shared history; causal lens holds tightly from motivation to outcome, with orientation anchored early and persistent constraint of visible Time shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with baroque asteroid details and temporal storms that constrain choice (mirrors covering) and charge the final image; sensory selection reflects urgency, and world rules are consistent, integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in the archaeological dispute escalates through protagonist agency during the temporal storm, forcing a tightening choice to write; cost is unmistakable in the reimagined identity and transformed conflict, driven causally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining history emerges organically from the shard and dispute, with subtext in gestures like covering mirrors; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "constellation of possibilities" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and poetic, with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "floating moments"; voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., mirror covering) is taught and paid off, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "shimmering curtains" is purposeful and clear, and syntax varies to support momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis of visible Time and archaeological dispute, transformed through character-specific choices; risk-taking in poetic resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
