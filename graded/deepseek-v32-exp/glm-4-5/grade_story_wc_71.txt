<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions with concrete interiority. Her realization is earned through prior causality, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands with cost in the conceptual repricing of houses holding echoes of love. Orientation is clear early, and the shard's role tightens understanding decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the bay and objects charging the final image. However, the environment doesn't strongly constrain choices, capping it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aria's agency with objects, leading to a legible cost in her revelation. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but escalation isn't intensely driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory and presence. No moralizing; subtext in objects and images deepens impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with good propulsion, but minor overwriting in figurative language slightly dulls peak beats. No major loops or artifacts; clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing objects and silence into a non-obvious arc. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
