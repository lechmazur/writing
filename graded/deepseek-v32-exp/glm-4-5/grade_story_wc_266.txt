<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the collective guides dilute individual characterization, though the final realization is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as guides become ferry guides of courage, under a Hybrid lens; orientation is clear early, and causality holds with the journey leading to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., indirect routes); the veiled ridgeway and final cavern charge the image with atmospheric depth, supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the quest for courage, driven by agency; cost is legible when dragons are found, though the conflict is internal rather than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of courage emerges organically from the journey and symbols; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriched by the dragon imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical; perceptual signature is strong, with no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., mist) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic but has minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "liquid twilight" metaphor); no major artifacts, though some phrasing could be more concise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ferry guides and courage dragons with specificity; risk-taking in mystical elements heightens stakes, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
