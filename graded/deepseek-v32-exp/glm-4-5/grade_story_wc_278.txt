<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is embodied and drives his actions, with micro-choices like initiating the tether sequence revealing his hierarchy of values. The final relief is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in Elias's tears and the tattoo, reconfiguring his guilt under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the tether sequence arises from established motives without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The laboratory and amber constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like the "otherworldly blue lights" filtered through Elias's professional bias, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around silencing guilt escalate through Elias's agency in using the amber, leading to a visible cost in his emotional release. The tightening under the causal lens is meaningful but slightly muted in trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief and redemption emerges through particulars like the lullaby and amber, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the insect's transformation from prison to sanctuary enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "hands as steady as the stars he inked." The signed dialogue with the AI is natural and goal-driven, with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "meteor hush" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like haunted firmware and constellation tattooing feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the temporal fold heightening stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
