<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the parachute buckle and inputting codes without conscious thought. The protagonist's burden and inventive nature are consistent, driving credible endurance. However, some repetitive phrasing slightly flattens depth, but closure choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise as the protagonist prepares to transmit, reconfiguring stakes under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final lines. The emergency message escalates pressure coherently, though the radio static repetition is mildly formulaic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the thin atmosphere altering tactics. Sensory details (e.g., nocturnal arbor humming) are purposeful and filtered through POV. The environment charges the final image, integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving trust escalates through the emergency protocol and atmospheric anomalies, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is felt in the burden and impending danger, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs with the decoded message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of duty and revision emerges through events and images like the parachute buckle's reweighted meaning. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in "Preserve trust" deepens complexity, though slight abstraction in "watcher's burden" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose under pressure. Voice coheres through selective attention and inventive trait. Minor template cadence in "Remembering through muscle memory" stems, but no head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, but suffers from paraphrase loops (e.g., "watcher's burden" repeated) and minor scaffold in repetitive stems. Figurative language is generally clear, though closure image remains undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a pattern seeker in an arboreal kingdom feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details transform familiar tropes, though some phrases echo common templates.</comment>
