<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is strong with clear motives rooted in her father's gambling and her own probability work. Interiority is concrete, such as her embodied emotion in "clover melancholy," and her final peace is earned through prior causality. Minor abstraction in some reflections prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elena finds peace in uncertainty, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the build-up relies heavily on reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rainwashed library and subway scrawls filtering through Elena's POV. The candle lantern acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elena's internal conflict between probability and gambling, escalating under the accumulative lens through her discoveries and reflections. Agency in reinterpreting scrawls drives deepening, with cost visible in her realized peace, but escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty emerges through events and images like the lantern and scrawls, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elena's acceptance, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elena's probability background. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision in reflections is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency issues prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing story and character. Minor overwriting in phrases like "clover melancholy" causes slight figurative muddle, but no major artifacts harm closure or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of probability theory and personal grief, with specific details like subway scrawls transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in internal focus heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on reflective modes.</comment>
