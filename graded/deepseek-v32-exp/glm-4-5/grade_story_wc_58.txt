<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Traveler's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., feeling garden scents and memory weight. Final choice to write his own obituary is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of the weft thread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early (traveler in garden, autumn, after ship sailed). Closure is a conceptual repricing as he begins writing his own obituary, with felt cost in the weft thread's reconfiguration, making absence and healing legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—shadowed garden, autumn leaves, scents of earth and decay—filtered through POV and constraining choice by shaping reflection. The garden charges the final image, directly supporting the closure's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of understanding absences and healing escalate through deepening reflection, driven by traveler's agency in projecting presence and writing. Cost is legible in the weft thread's transformation and his decision to write his own obituary, foreclosing paths under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absences and healing emerges through events and images (e.g., weft thread as bridge), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the traveler's self-obituary, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, reflective prose consistent throughout. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., past absences) is taught and pays off in closure, enhancing emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "leaves danced like spirits"). Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, but no artifacts harming clarity; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of writing obituaries for the living is fresh and transformed through specific details (e.g., weft thread, projection of presence). Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
