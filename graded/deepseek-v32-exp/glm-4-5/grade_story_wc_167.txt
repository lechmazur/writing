<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents a higher score. The epiphany feels earned but leans on summary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Mara's realization reweights her purpose, with cost legible in her "sacred resolve." The accumulative/textural lens holds, taught early through patterns and paid off at the end. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with Pearl Bay at dawn constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "prism atrium" and "weathered boulders," integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating value in the mundane) escalates through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in her decision to transform perspectives. Cost is legible in her renewed intention, though external pressure is minimal, limiting higher band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the pond ripples and prism atrium, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, avoiding abstraction and earning wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Mara's profession and introspection. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, though minor ornamentation in peaks slightly reduces immediacy. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied syntax and strong rhythm, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings") risks overwriting without clarity loss. No major loops or artifacts; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The harbor glazier premise offers a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes, but it lacks the non-obvious inevitability for the highest band.</comment>
