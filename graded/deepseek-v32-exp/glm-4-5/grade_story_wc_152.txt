<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as feigning confusion to the official. Her disguised wisdom drives key turns, and the final renunciation of recognition is earned, though minor lack of depth in flaws limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the coup fails due to Elara's coded interventions, with cost legible in "the conspiracy unraveled thread by thread." Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory detail like "cobalt observatory" and "autumn winds," but while the eternal candle and observatory enrich atmosphere, they only subtly constrain choices rather than being pivotal to tactics or closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, as she decodes celestial patterns and introduces calculated delays, with cost visible in her hidden efforts. The dominant stake of preventing the coup tightens meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden resistance emerges through subtext and image, such as Elara's feigned foolishness, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Integration is seamless, though complexity is slightly safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evidenced in poetic phrases like "prismatic tears." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts, with lines like "the eternal candle's flame swelling with each revelation" advancing multiple layers. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes embroidery with cosmic decoding in a fresh, inevitable way, transforming tropes through specific details like "adjacent possibilities." Risk-taking in subtle resistance heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
