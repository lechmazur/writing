<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization and acceptance of her role feel earned, though internal conflict is minimal, slightly limiting depth. The cost of her commitment is legible in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Maya understands her purpose and takes the fossil, with felt cost in her renewed responsibility. The causal drive lens holds strong, and orientation is anchored early. The fossil's role as a persistent constraint shapes the ending effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the coastal cave network constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like thermal mapping and cool stone walls are integrated into action, reflecting Maya's POV. The environment pressures tactics and supports atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, as her exploration leads to discovering the fossil and learning its language. The dominant stake of understanding hibernation tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her hours of effort and newfound responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the fossil as a transitional object offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of knowledge and purpose. Subtext operates through emotional heat signatures, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tied to Maya's sensitivity. Voice is consistent and slightly poetic, modulating under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though occasional phrases like "darkness that had welcomed few visitors" edge toward purple without muddling clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-hibernation world-building, sensory mapping, and mystical elements with freshness and specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and the emotional arc feels inevitable. Risk-taking in integrating the fossil pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
