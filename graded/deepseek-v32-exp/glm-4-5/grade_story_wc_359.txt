<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and rooted in her synesthetic gifts, with interiority shown through embodied perception. Her final action is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, but the lack of contradictory impulses prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (tears of joy, transformed perception). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and the sculpted hush lands on-page with undeniable impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice cavern constrains choices by refracting sound and light, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Eira's POV. The setting pressures tactics and integrates seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) escalates through Eira's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in observers' reactions. One meaningful tightening occurs as the performance builds to the sculpted hush, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sculpted hush. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet coherent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative build, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prism-song bell ringer and sculpted hush feels inevitable. Specific, grounded choices transform tropes through character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
