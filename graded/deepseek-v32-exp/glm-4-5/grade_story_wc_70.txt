<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices under pressure, such as revealing information against duty. Her motivation to preserve wonder is dramatized through micro-choices like assisting the couple, and the supervisor's despair adds depth. However, some emotional beats rely on told elements like "tears in his eyes" rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's honesty bridges wonder and routine, felt cost in the supervisor's remorse and blackout aftermath. Causal lens holds tightly from blackout to truthfulness to sabotage revelation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image reweights prior stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the lightning tower and nectar dusk, constraining choices as the ascent limits access and the transformer room focalizes the climax. Sensory details like "golden light" on the lacquer box are purposeful, and the tower acts as micro-setting that charges the final image of bees returning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring order versus preserving wonder escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens, from truthfully disclosing beehive failure to guiding the investigation. Cost is legible in the supervisor's sabotage and emotional toll, narrowing options to a decisive confrontation in the lightning chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in routine emerges organically through events like the riddle and supervisor's motive, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elara's smile bridging truth and hope, reweighting the blackout's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV from Elara is stable, with voice distinct in her involuntary truthfulness shaping dialogue and perception. Dialogue advances plot naturally, as in the bureau couple's revelation, and rhythmic control holds under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density, advancing story through vivid lines like "arcs of electricity occasionally jumped between conductors." No major artifacts, loops, or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully, and figurative language like "nectar dusk" enhances atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the involuntary truthfulness concept and drone beehive failure, transforming tropes through specific world logic. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the truth trait heightening stakes without gimmickry, though close to familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
