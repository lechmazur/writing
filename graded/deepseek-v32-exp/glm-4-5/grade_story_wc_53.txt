<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cyrus's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving higher-stakes choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as his trembling hands and fragmented consciousness. However, minor reliance on summary for backstory ("decades of searching") slightly reduces immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change (wheel dissolution and carousel restart) and felt cost under a Hybrid drive lens; causality is strong with because/therefore linkages from collected stories to bridge formation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, though the time-warp concept introduces slight ambiguity that doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory detail ("iridescent debris," "shimmering surface") integrated into action. POV bias filters setting through Cyrus's priorities, and micro-setting (camera wheel harness) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cyrus's agency in collecting stories and using the camera wheel, narrowing options under the Hybrid lens; cost is legible when the wheel dissolves. Dominant stake (reconciling with the past) tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are less pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and time emerges through particulars like the camera wheel and ghost negotiation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, but minor thematic echo in "unforeseeable new beginnings" slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; prose texture is lyrical yet consistent. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (time-warps) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, but figurative language in peak beats ("fractured stillness," "liquid peace") risks mild overwriting without pattern-teaching. No major loops or scaffold, though minor synonym churn ("majestic, haunting music") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (kinetic lagoon, camera wheel, ghost negotiation) feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in structure and premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "disposable camera wheel" transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
