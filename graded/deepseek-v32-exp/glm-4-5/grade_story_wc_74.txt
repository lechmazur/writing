<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the depth of internal conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost (hope vindicated despite insomnia), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the brush and moon as persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the greenhouse and brush constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (painting and daydreams intensifying), with cost legible in her dedication and insomnia. Stakes are coherent and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the brush and lost languages, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to human connection without moralizing. Subtext operates through daydreams and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Elision in daydreams is taught and pays off, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of lost languages and universal kindness, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Details are specific and irreplaceable.</comment>
