<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlo's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving his plan to challenge Vance. His interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as whispering directions. The final earned change—Vance's suspicion and Marlo's added map—carries visible cost, foreclosing a path with tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages, culminating in a decisive change where Marlo's whisper technique succeeds. Closure is on-page with cost in Vance's curiosity and the new map. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral, with the container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the humming metal and acoustic highways, shaping tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—escalates through Marlo's agency, with a meaningful tightening as he positions himself and whispers. Cost is legible in Vance's reaction and the new map, under the causal lens, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of subtlety vs. loudness emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in whispered directions and the zodiac coin. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marlo's added map and Vance's curiosity, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Marlo's perceptual signature filtering setting and action. Voice is consistent under pressure, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and character, and figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats like the whisper execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is original, synthesizing acoustics, geomagnetic storms, and container labyrinths with specific details. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in the concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
