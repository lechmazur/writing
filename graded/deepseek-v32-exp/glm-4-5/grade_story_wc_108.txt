<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's phobias and adaptive nature are concretely embodied through trembling hands and breathing techniques, with internal conflict shown under pressure. The final choice to embrace vulnerability is earned by prior causality, though the label "firmly adaptive" is slightly tell-y. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and cost is visible in heart-pounding fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Maya facing hunters, reconfiguring her identity through vulnerability; cost is legible in "smiled through her heart-pounding fear." Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from betrayal to decryption to confrontation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (phobias) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with rusted shelves and starlight through skylight, constraining choices by providing hiding and deciphering resources. The library charges the final image where silhouettes appear, and sensory details (phosphorescent glow) are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under causal lens: decrypting notes forces confrontation, narrowing options. Dominant stake (survival/truth) tightens with ticking clock and approaching footsteps. Cost is unmistakable in fear and danger, though the organization remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through concrete actions and the seashell's whispers, not moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Maya embracing truth, reweighting prior fabrication. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding simplification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction ("whispering seashell") with crisis narrowness. Dialogue from seashell feels natural and goal-driven. Minor register elevation in "cascading starlight" but remains voice-consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but minor overwriting like "cascading starlight" slightly muddles peak beats. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion advances stakes clearly. Figurative language is generally purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes stunt double phobias with billionaire heiress betrayal in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific character choices and world logic. Risk-taking in thematic focus on vulnerability heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
