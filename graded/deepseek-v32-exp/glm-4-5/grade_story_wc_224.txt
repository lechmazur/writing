<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maven's motivation to understand home is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in moments like sitting motionless with her mercury glass. Her internal conflict is shown through her search for something unnamed, and the final realization is earned through the stone and feather. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Maven realizes home is about connections, with cost felt in her transformed perception. The Accumulative lens holds through sensory density and pattern shifts, and the stone and feather persistently shape tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the climax is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices by shifting in response to Maven's actions, and the feather and stone as micro-settings charge the final image. Sensory details like "scent of aging paper" are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Maven's agency in using the feather to reshape reality, tightening the stake of understanding home. Cost is legible in the bookstore's transformation and her internal shift. However, the stakes remain largely internal, slightly limiting visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that home is connections, reweighting prior search without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the mercury glass and hidden thunder, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent in Maven's noticing. No dialogue is present, but elision is purposeful, and rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Minor register consistency keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "hidden thunder" is coherent and advances momentum, though minor purple prose touches peak beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of the bookstore as a nexus of stories, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
