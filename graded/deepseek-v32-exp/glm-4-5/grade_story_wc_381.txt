<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but lacks internal contradictory impulses in scene and emotion is not deeply embodied, with some abstract phrasing like "quiet intensity." Final choice is earned, but no flaws or struggles complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under Accumulative lens, as the prophecy is hushed and crane released with relief; orientation is clear early, and silence mapping acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details, and the crane's wing as a micro-setting charges the final image, but the environment doesn't strongly constrain choices, limiting higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in the ritual steps, with cost unmistakable at closure under Accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening occurs as mapping silence reveals intervention point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges from events and images without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the crane's release, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision in silence mapping is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high density, but minor register drift in "terrestrially cosmic" creates slight artifice in peak beats without obscuring closure; no major loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes; concept of mapping silence and origami crane transforms familiar tropes through specific details.</comment>
