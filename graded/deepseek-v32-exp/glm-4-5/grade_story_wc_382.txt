<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through her interactions with Mr. Abernathy. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the "spark of recognition" during the seal exchange. The final realization of shared heritage is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting the responsibility. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Clara understands their lineage and the building language, with cost legible in her carrying the seal and the dawn breaking. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through weekly sessions to the rooftop revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the plot progresses with coherent causality. The desk seal and meteor shower charge the final image with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the cluttered study to the rooftop garden during the meteor shower, which pressures choices and illuminates secrets. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Clara's POV, such as the city skyline "glittering below like constellations." The antique desk seal acts as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Clara's desire to learn the building language, escalating through lessons to the rooftop interrogation where agency drives revelation. Under the accumulative lens, deepening understanding reweights stakes, with cost felt in the shared heritage realization. One meaningful tightening occurs as the meteor shower illuminates truths, foreclosing ignorance. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance and hidden stories emerges through events and images, not direct statement, such as the desk seal symbolizing warnings and histories. Subtext operates in the "agreed upon lies" and the mysterious familiarity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the buildings becoming "old friends."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Clara is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in her noticing building patterns. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, e.g., "ephemeral as forgotten words." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot and subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally, such as during the rooftop interrogation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "meteors streaked across the darkness, ephemeral as forgotten words" are coherent. Read-aloud test passes with purposeful syntax. Line-level craft is clean, with strong verbs and specific nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of building language and shared heritage, transforming tropes through specific details like the desk seal and lineage revelation. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity anchors universals. No derivative premise or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
