<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final decision to step into the ink is earned by prior causality, and the trait of being "consciously wild" constrains actions. However, minor diagnostic self-awareness in phrases like "serene anger" slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, leading to a decisive change in the tracker's temporal displacement. Closure lands on-page with cost (dangerous vital fluctuations), and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without ambiguity, though the transition back from displacement is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the wind-carved encampment constraining choices and charging the final image through its role in magnifying temporal anomalies. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the tracker's POV, and the micro-setting of the ink slab actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding temporal distortion) escalates through the tracker's agency in using the ink, leading to a meaningful tightening with visible cost (physical danger upon return). Pressure coheres under the causal lens, and the final reconfiguration of knowledge forecloses prior paths with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer ("Time doesn't slow; we change our relationship to it") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through the transformation of "serene anger" into understanding, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting the tracker's specialized focus. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the displacement experience) is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though the drone's responses are functional rather than deeply characterized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits strong rhythm and clarity, with high information density and no significant artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs. Minor register consistency in "serene anger" does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (albino tracker, disappearing ink, temporal experiments) with specificity and risk, transforming tropes through grounded choices. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and bold structural choices (e.g., displacement) heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
