<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with embodied emotion like "ache that settled in her bones." Her decision to propagate the violin's essence is earned by prior causality, and the cost of the original violin becoming inert is felt. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in "the original violin lay inert, its internal fractures now deep scars." The causal drive lens holds tightly, and the empire's threat shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ice violin and observatory constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "transparent violin’s edge" and "mulberry-hued drapes" are filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively guides the propagation action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the violin's dream escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, driven by the coffee vision. Cost is unmistakable in the violin's inert state after propagation. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of propagation as resistance emerges organically from events, with subtext in plant whispers and coffee stains. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new violin budding, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "frozen constellations" and "mulberry ache." Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "a fruit left too long on the branch" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy, ice violin, and propagation feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the unconventional resolution. Specific details like harmonic frequency and plant consciousness heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
