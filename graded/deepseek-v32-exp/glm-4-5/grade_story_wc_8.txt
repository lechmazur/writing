<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks deep internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices, limiting peak emotional impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (finding the ledger) and conceptual cost under a causal lens; orientation is early and clear, but the persistent constraint of the letter guides tactics without intense personal cost for Eleanor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described and POV-filtered, with the ivy-covered station constraining choices and charging the final image as a metaphor for obscured truth, though sensory detail could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing truth) escalates through Eleanor's agency, with one meaningful tightening (ledger discovery) and legible cost for the forgotten workers, but no major reversals or deep personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. noble lies emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it remains somewhat straightforward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice consistent with Eleanor's scholarly perspective, but perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness under pressure, and no dialogue limits subtext exploration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with good information density, but minor overwriting and repetitive phrasing (e.g., "noble lies" reiteration) slightly dull momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar elements with specific details like the illuminated letter, offering grounded execution but no bold risks or transformative originality beyond competent integration.</comment>
