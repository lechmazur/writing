<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and intensifies through her active experimentation, with embodied interiority shown through vibrations and memories. Her final choice to teach again is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional rebirth. Contradictory impulses of despair and hope are dramatized in scene, such as when she tentatively places the record, revealing character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eleanor shares the backward songs with students, reconfiguring her life with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics, leading to an inevitable yet fresh ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details like vibrations and stone walls filtered through Eleanor's POV. The broken phonograph needle and records function as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally with events, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her experiments with backward songs deepen stakes and lead to teaching. The dominant stake of defeating emotional numbness tightens through a meaningful cadence shift, with cost legible in her tears and shared vibrations. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres until the final image reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through events and images, such as vibrations representing music beyond sound, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and rebirth through the "symphony of silence." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, inviting reflection through purposeful ambiguity and character complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Eleanor's voice reflects her musical background and emotional state. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, such as in the lyrical description of the filament of hush. Any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "mirrored hush" is consistent and purposeful, though slight poetic density in peak beats prevents a higher score. Grammar and punctuation are clean, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes with a fresh, non-obvious angle on deafness and music, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the backward songs concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details, like the broken phonograph needle, create authenticity, and the closure recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
