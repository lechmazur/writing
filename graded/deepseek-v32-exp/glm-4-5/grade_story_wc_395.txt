<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies with risk-taking; her interiority is concrete, shown through embodied reactions like "something skipped her breath." However, contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost (alarms screaming, career at risk) under a causal lens; orientation is strong early, and the plot progresses through because/therefore linkages, with the patch and numbers shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the archive constraining choices; sensory details like "static electricity" and the recurring patch charge the final image, though other senses could be more balanced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, such as lying for access, narrowing options with visible cost; the dominant stake (truth-seeking) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, though some risks feel slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. deletion emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but subtext could be deeper in key beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., fragmented video) is taught and paid off, though dialogue is minimal and internal monologue occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, but some overwriting like "digital static like ghosts in the machine" causes minor figurative muddle; no major loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cyberpunk and mystery with fresh specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded details like the memory keeper role, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
