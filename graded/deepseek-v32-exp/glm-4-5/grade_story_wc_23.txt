<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Navigator's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance of finding purpose is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the mixture of pride and sorrow. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the navigator's emotional resonance and the censer foot's intensity, under a Hybrid drive lens (accumulative texture with causal elements). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the persistent constraint of the moon phases shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the starlit signal station and censer foot acting as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Details are filtered through POV bias, integrating into action and mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding ships escalates under the Hybrid lens through navigator's agency, with cost legible in the censer foot's heat and emotional weight. The tightening forecloses options as the moon peaks, driving the climax with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and return emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in cryptic calls and the navigator's scars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the cycle of departure and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, controlled rhythm under pressure, and purposeful elision taught early. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Slight density in figurative language at peaks, like "geography of loss," mildly impacts propulsion but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic navigation with mystical elements feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the censer foot and reverse migration. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
