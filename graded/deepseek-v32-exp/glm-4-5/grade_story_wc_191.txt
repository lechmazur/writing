<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like peeling the paint layers. Her final renunciation of power is earned by prior causality, showing visible cost in her acceptance. However, interior contradiction is minimal, with no strong conflicting impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara completes her mission, felt cost in her smile and acceptance. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and time pressure shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the elevator shaft reveal reconfigures options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard and monolith constraining choices through the paint-peeling mechanic. Sensory details like "digital fruits" and "crystalline circuitry" charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the stairway) escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency and time pressure. Cost is legible in her renunciation and the trembling ground. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ruby flake projects the map, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship emerges organically from Elara's actions and the final image of her preparing the throne. Subtext operates in her whisper and smile, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept integrates seamlessly with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a retro-futurist voice evident in phrases like "memory-formatted forests." Perceptual signature is character-specific, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes through specific world-building and character choices, like the ruby flake's evolution.
