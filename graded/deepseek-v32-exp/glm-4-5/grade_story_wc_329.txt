<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elayn's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but lacks internal conflict or flaws, making her characterization competent yet one-dimensional; no contradictory impulses under pressure reduce depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with causal coherence, but the cost is light and not deeply felt on-page (e.g., escape from statues is smooth), slightly undermining stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposefully constrains choices (e.g., orchard statues force heart-rhythm tactics), with sensory detail filtered through POV; the enchanted orchard charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, but cost remains subtle (e.g., no tangible loss during uprooting or escape), limiting visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty vs. mechanization emerges organically through events and images (e.g., crystalline fruit transformation), offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., musical noticing); no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and clarity without loops or overwriting; figurative language enhances momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (e.g., heart rhythms, living statues) feels organic and transformative; risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
