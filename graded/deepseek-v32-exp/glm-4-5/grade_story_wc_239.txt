<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The witness's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but interiority is abstract with minimal embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final unification feels earned but lacks personal conflict or tangible cost, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost in the unification's echo, and the accumulative lens holds. However, causality is loose, relying on abstract patterns rather than tight linkages, slightly weakening the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library setting vividly constrains choices with shelves that rearrange based on intention, and sensory details like the "resounding hush" charge the final image. Specificity is high and purposefully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the witness's agency under the accumulative lens, with spiral arbitration intensifying stakes. The cost is legible in the completion's echo, though the conflict remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of unity and illusion emerge coherently through events, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end. However, some abstract phrasing risks pseudo-profundity, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature reflecting the witness's cosmic role. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and density, but overwriting with stacked metaphors (e.g., "wanderingly exact steps") causes minor clarity issues in peak beats. No major loops, but figurative language is heavy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and philosophical concepts feels inevitable, with risk-taking in abstract narrative heightening stakes. The closure integrates elements uniquely, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
