<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his ghostly nature and love for the stage, with embodied emotion in moments like "nostalgia washed over him." His final dissolution is earned by prior causality, showing cost. However, internal conflict is minimal, with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Silas dissolves, saving the garden under an accumulative/textural lens. The timeline fracture and dawn deadline provide persistent constraints. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is coherent with a single scene, but minor ellipsis in timeline mechanics slightly limits inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the hedge maze and orchard constraining choices and charging the final image. Synesthetic details like "ribbons of colored light" are purposeful and POV-filtered. No generic elements; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, with escalation driven by Silas's agency as he sings, sacrificing his essence. Cost is legible in his flickering form and dissolution. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the conflict lacks a mid-beat reversal, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of hope and redemption emerge organically through images like the tarot coin and garden restoration, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Silas's dissolution and the new tenor. However, some thematic elements feel slightly underexplored in the middle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, sensory-rich narration that reflects Silas's synesthesia. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful. But occasional register drift into elevated diction ("spectral essence") slightly disrupts consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and clear propulsion. No major loops or artifacts, though minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "shimmering with a silver-blue glow." Information density is high, and closure beats are unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost, synesthesia, and timeline repair feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the tarot coin. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off, but the concept isn't fully subversive, limiting a higher score.</comment>
