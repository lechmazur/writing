<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in his past, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His micro-choices, like tracing the cast, reveal his values under pressure. The final whisper to Lina is an earned renunciation with visible cost, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in Kaelen's promise, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure is coherent with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kaelen's POV, enhancing tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lina's grief) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in his whispered promise with legible cost. Pressure coheres and tightens through the smudged notes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and meaning emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in objects like the coral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Kaelen's mind under pressure. No head-hopping, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density, though minor overwriting ("lotus-hearted ache") slightly dulls peak beats. No major artifacts or loops; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and organic, synthesizing translation and grief through specific details. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
