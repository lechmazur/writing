<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like trembling hands. The keeper's internal conflict with scattered memories drives the arc, and the final fulfillment is earned through causal actions. Minor abstraction in some descriptions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (bound release) under an accumulative lens, cost legible in the keeper's rest and realm's awakening. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the alchemical orchard and mica window constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like phosphorescent flora and cold mica are filtered through the keeper's POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the accumulative lens, with urgency quickening steps and song strengthening. Cost is legible in the effort to weave dawns, though the conflict lacks sharp external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and community emerges organically through images like woven dawns and forgotten songs, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like swaddling saplings, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the keeper's scattered state. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., mirror world rules) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving purpose. Minor overwriting in phrases like "fractured glass" appears but doesn't obscure closure; no significant loops or artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory and light-weaving, transformed through specific details like starlight saplings. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
