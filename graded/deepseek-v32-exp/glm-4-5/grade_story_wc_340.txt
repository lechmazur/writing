<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira's warmly inquisitive nature is consistently embodied and drives her actions, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the goggles). However, contradictory impulses between detachment and affection are more summarized than acted in scene, slightly limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the decryption reveals the captain's dual existence, charging the final image with cost (her silent promise). Accumulative lens holds strong, with elevator floors structuring reflection toward insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire and goggles constrain choice and charge the climax; sensory details (crystalline walls, cold straps) are selective and POV-filtered. The environment actively shapes tactics and final meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through accumulative density, driven by Elira's agency in using the goggles. Cost is legible in her decision to preserve the secret, foreclosing a path with felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges through particulars (diary decryption, captain's sorrow) without moralizing. Ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Elira's curiosity and modulates with pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., delayed decryption method) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("crystallized walls fracturing light") integrates seamlessly, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator ascent, goggles, and diary decryption feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids template plots.</comment>
