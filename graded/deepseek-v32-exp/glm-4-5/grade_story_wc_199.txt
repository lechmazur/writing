<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. However, the lack of deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits the complexity, though her transformation is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (transformation and message revelation) under the accumulative/textural lens, with felt cost in her physical change. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and tools like the bone tool constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. Setting is integral to action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding the message) escalate through agency with the moonstone discovery, driving a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her transformation, though conflict remains low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cycle and transformation emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is woven through motifs like seeds and monuments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, and any elision is purposeful, though minor overwriting occurs without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and precise with good rhythmic variation and information density. Minor overwriting (e.g., "mossy delight" repetition) and figurative language are present but do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a seed sorter in a skyward realm offers a fresh synthesis, with specific details transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric design pays off, though it is not groundbreaking.</comment>
