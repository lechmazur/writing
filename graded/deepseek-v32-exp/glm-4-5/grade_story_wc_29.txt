<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her obsessive actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "hairs on her arms stand at attention"). However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and flaws do not profoundly complicate choices, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the signals stopping, but cost is implied rather than felt on-page; causal lens holds strong with logical progression, though the absence of a vivid cost moment at the climax slightly weakens impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details (e.g., "vintage equipment hummed," "astronomical charts trembled") and constrains choices; the radio station and charts charge the final image, integrating tightly with character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the interference act; stakes are clear, but cost remains potential rather than visibly paid, reducing tension at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of perception manipulation emerges organically through events and subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with ongoing struggle, avoiding moralizing and leveraging conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and professional, though absence of dialogue limits evaluation of subtext and character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or overwriting, and figurative language enhances clarity without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle on alien manipulation through division; execution is specific and earned, though it echoes familiar tropes without full transformation, keeping it from higher innovation.</comment>
