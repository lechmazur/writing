<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is deeply rooted in her past experiences, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her realization at the end feels earned by prior causality, and the cost of accepting change is visible. However, minor reliance on reflective summary slightly limits on-page contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the final image of folding the atlas page and accepting planetary cycles. The Accumulative drive lens holds strong, with data and observations tightening toward revelation. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Marina's POV. Specificity is purposeful, such as the concrete wall and crashing waves, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through Marina's agency in assembling clues and cross-referencing data, leading to a cost-legible realization. The dominant stake of understanding disappearing paths tightens meaningfully, though escalation is quiet rather than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the atlas page and coral bleaching, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the concept of planetary cycles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Marina's expertise and emotional state. Rhythmic prose and patterned elision (e.g., tapping) are taught and paid off, enhancing texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with strong rhythm and variation, but minor repetitive phrasing (e.g., "tapping rhythms" and "periodically eternal") creates slight artifact drag. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of climate change with delayed revelation, avoiding tropes through specific lived detail. The quiet, conceptual ending feels inevitable and bold, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
