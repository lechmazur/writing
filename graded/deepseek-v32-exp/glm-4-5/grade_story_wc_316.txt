<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to defeat numbness is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and earned change when she embraces pain to vivify the brain. Interiority is concrete, though minor tell-y moments like "felt hollow" slightly reduce specificity. The final choice is causally earned, with visible cost in her trembling and the dojo's tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (Maya's pain and the brain's awakening) under a consistent Causal lens. Orientation is clear early with dojo and rewrite anchors. The temporal rewrite tightens options, shaping tactics, and the closure unit reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating dojo and brain jar constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cool glass" and "ethereal light" are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and the environment pressures action through instability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify brain before rewrite) escalates under Causal lens via time pressure and Maya's agency. Cost is legible when she embraces pain, narrowing options. However, escalation feels slightly rushed, with the rewrite threat more declared than deeply tested in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and consciousness emerges organically from Maya's arc and the brain's awakening, with subtext in gestures like tracing the jar. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "bridge between opposites" image, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior numbness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature reflecting Maya's numbness. Voice controls rhythm under pressure, e.g., "shed her former identity like a snake shedding skin." No dialogue, but elision is purposeful and closure legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "kaleidoscope of genuine emotion" is coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image is clear, with propulsion maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ego death and clone custody with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the floating dojo. Emotional truth in numbness and awakening feels authentic, and the final reconfiguration is earned, with risk-taking in the cosmic setting heightening stakes.</comment>
