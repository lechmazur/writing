<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices, but internal conflict lacks deep embodiment; emotions are stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to expose truth gently is earned, with visible cost in the healing of worlds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the captain's spirit freed and snow globe glowing, under a causal lens; cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid settings like frigid waters and glacier shrine are purposeful; the snow globe as a recurring object constrains choices and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without generic detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency using the snow globe, narrowing options to expose truth; cost is visible in the cover-up exposure and healing between worlds, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity emerges through events and images like the snow globe; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in "borrowed starlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "borrowed starlight," and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language like "windows of connection" enhances clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver ghost whisperer and melted snow globe feels inevitable; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
