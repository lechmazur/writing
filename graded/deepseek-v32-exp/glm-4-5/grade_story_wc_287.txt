<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final purpose crystallization is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the peaceful illumination. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the lockmaster's tool persistently shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "liquid mercury" harbor. The lockmaster's tooth as a micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, deepening through the encounter with Jim. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of purpose, though stakes remain introspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and light emerges through concrete actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext in the alcove scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "wistfully pragmatic heart." Dialogue is natural and advances plot, but minor register consistency could be sharper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "shimmered like liquid mercury" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardening, lockmaster lore, and light reflection feels inevitable. Specific details avoid tropes, and emotional truth elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
