<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his "precisely humane" approach, intensifying as discoveries compel higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like handling the liqueur label, though contradictory impulses are more implied than acted out in scene. The final choice to expunge the false narrative is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his transformed purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Thomas commits to reclaiming truth, with cost felt in his crystallized purpose under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight, from the wind chime's silence to the photograph trail, with no orientation debt. The persistent constraint of the submerged town's history shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with sensory details like the "mirrored hush" and emerging rooftops filtering through Thomas's POV. The ridgeway and reservoir environment constrain choices by revealing the town, charging the final image where the landscape mirrors his internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving legacy escalates through Thomas's agency under the Accumulative lens, from discovering the label to uncovering photographs. A meaningful tightening occurs as his realization forecloses his prior narrative upheld, with cost legible in his decision to petition authorities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and truth emerges organically through images like the wind chime and photographs, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Thomas's purpose crystallizing, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and Thomas's selective attention. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, such as in the quiet revelation of his aunt's role, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "mirrored hush" is purposeful and clear, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with discoveries without obscuring causality at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of the submerged town trope, grounded in specific details like the liqueur label and photographs. Risk-taking in the accumulative, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
