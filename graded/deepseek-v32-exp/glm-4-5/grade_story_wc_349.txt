<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation to find where stories begin is clear and rooted in their parole condition, with embodied micro-choices like selecting memory shards. Interiority is concrete, and the final realization is earned through on-page actions, though internal contradiction is subtle. The closure choice forecloses a path with visible cost when they understand stories begin in absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the vendor's insight that stories originate in emptiness, reconfiguring meaning under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image of narrative possibilities.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and bottled moonlight are vividly specific, constraining choices like the ritual incising and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the vendor's POV, with the setting actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in the vendor's actions, leading to the opening ceremony that narrows options. The dominant stake (finding where stories begin) tightens with agency, and cost is felt in the paradox realization, though the pace is contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about absence containing stories. Subtext operates through implication in the bottled moonlight and memory shards, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and elision is taught early. Rhythm and diction control under pressure heighten the accumulative effect without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and momentum, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements like bottled moonlight and glimmering parole into a fresh, non-obvious angle on storytelling. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable through specific particulars.</comment>
