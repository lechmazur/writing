<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority conveyed through embodied emotion. The borrowed heartbeat concept deepens character stakes, and the final melancholy cost is earned. However, some interiority leans abstract rather than concretely dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as visions vanish, with cost legible in the separation melancholy. Orientation is clear early, and the prism parapet's role amplifies causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like rain-dropped parapet and echoing terrace constraining choice and charging the final image. The environment actively shapes the magic's escalation and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with rain amplifying magic and bells tightening the timeframe. Cost is unmistakable in the post-vision melancholy, though escalation is more density-driven than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities emerges organically through images and action, with subtext in coded lullabies and borrowed heartbeat. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., coded songs) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor purple phrasing exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mirage painter, borrowed heartbeat, and coded lullabies feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
