<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fisher's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and actions that align under pressure. His cool-headedness and ability to transliterate emotions drive the narrative, and the final capture feels earned, though interior contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the echo's capture, reconfiguring the garden under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in the settled garden and fulfilled fisher, with the timeframe constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and sleepwalking constellations are vividly integrated, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with spatial coherence and POV-filtered perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, and escalation is driven by the fisher's agency in weaving emotions and zigzagging, under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the capture and garden's settlement, though not deeply transformative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of understanding in chaos, with subtext in actions and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, enriched by the echo's capture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and elision (e.g., voicing silence) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion, especially in peak beats like the capture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like the sound wave garden and emotion transliteration create a fresh, organic synthesis. Risk-taking in metaphysical concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
