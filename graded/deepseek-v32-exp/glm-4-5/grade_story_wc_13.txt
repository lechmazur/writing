<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like borrowing time revealing values. However, lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, limiting complexity. Final choice is earned with visible cost, but emotional embodiment is somewhat thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change and cost (collapsing, future shortened), under a causal lens that holds tightly. The giant's awakening and time borrowing create persistent constraints that shape tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is logical throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with rooftop canals and pendant constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered through the illustrator's perspective. Spatial choreography is coherent, guiding the protagonist's movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring rhythm) escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency and the giant's stirring. Cost is unmistakable in time borrowing depleting his future. Escalation tightens options meaningfully, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and rhythm emerges organically from events, with a resonant, non-literal ending. Subtext operates in echoes and cost, avoiding moralizing. However, theme lacks layered complexity and counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tied to the illustrator's profession. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and elision (e.g., time manipulation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Line-level craft supports momentum without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (illustrator, time-sculpting, echoes) feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
