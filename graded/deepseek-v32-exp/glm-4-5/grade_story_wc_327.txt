<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion at the climax, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, limiting depth. The final achievement is earned by prior causality, but the character remains somewhat one-dimensional without flaws or blind spots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (tears, laughter) as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, which holds throughout. The decades-long effort shapes tactics, and causality is intact with the bird pattern triggering the diamond's activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, with the bone towers and tunnel of echoes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, though slightly visual-dominant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the emotional release. The new bird pattern tightens pressure meaningfully, though conflict is low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving language through sensory translation emerges organically from events, with subtext in the diamond's purpose. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some direct statement slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, and rhythmic control enhances the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, even in peak beats, and syntax varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing unique elements like texture translation and copper veins into an inevitable arc. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure recharges prior material.</comment>
