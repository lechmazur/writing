<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to intervene is earned by prior causality, though her competence borders on overly rational, slightly reducing emotional complexity. The trait "devotedly observant" actively shapes her investigation, constraining choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly, with closure as a decisive change—Eleanor's realization and commitment to write the truth, costing her solitude but honoring her father. Orientation is anchored early; the proof-by-contradiction method creates tight because/therefore linkages. Cost is legible in the final image of the pen nib symbolizing justice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice by isolating Eleanor, while the rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens, using proof by contradiction to narrow options and uncover truth. The dominant stake—uncovering hidden truths—tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her transformation from regret to determination. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the orbits of regret reconfigured into justice, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Eleanor's playful solemnity. Minor overtness in "orbits of regret" concept slightly reduces subtlety, but subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Eleanor's voice remains coherent under pressure, and rhythmic control supports propulsion. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Minor overwriting in phrases like "echoing observatory" repeated, but clarity and momentum are maintained. Figurative language is controlled and serves the narrative without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—newsprint heiress, proof by contradiction, observatory setting—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific character choices and stakes. Risk-taking in method heightens coherence, though not groundbreaking; emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
