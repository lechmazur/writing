<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her choices. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion, though some feelings are told rather than shown. The transformation from resigned to hopeful is earned through causality, with visible cost in her persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (passing the baton) under an accumulative/textural lens, cost legible in the gift of the rosette. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the velvet library and zither rosette constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful, though minor repetition in descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the accumulative lens, from initial choir tension to public performances. Cost is legible in the effort to unify voices, with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges from events and symbols, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though some lines are slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, advancing story efficiently. Minor loops in phrases like "expectantly resigned" but no major artifacts obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of harmony and subtraction concepts feels inevitable. Specific details transform tropes, with risk-taking in theme, though not fully groundbreaking.</comment>
