<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in her trauma as a capsize survivor, driving her to translate silence into music. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions shown through actions like striking the tuning fork and tracing invisible melodies. The final joy and success feel earned by her on-page efforts, though internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, but the emotional progression is somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elena succeeds in creating a new musical language, rectifying her trauma and the world's silence with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through heat patterns and emotional mapping. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, amplifying heat patterns and constraining Elena's choices. It functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, integral to her method. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through her POV. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence into music escalates under the accumulative lens through Elena's agency in mapping heat patterns. Cost is legible in her personal triumph over trauma and the world's loss. One meaningful deepening occurs as she observes plant responses, narrowing options. Protagonist-driven escalation is clear, though the conflict lacks sharp reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and transforming silence emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the concept of visible music. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Elena's focused attention on heat and light. Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated, but internal voice coheres.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Read-aloud test passes smoothly, and line-level craft supports the closure without artifacts. Concise and vivid throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing silence, heat-mapping, and music into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Emotional truth and specificity avoid tropes, with risk-taking in concept that heightens stakes. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its implications. Bold choices enhance coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
