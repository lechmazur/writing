<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion shown through actions like raw fingers from reassembling letters. Internal conflict is present when she touches the diamond despite curses, and her final shift to keeper feels earned. However, the repetitive use of "sharply observant" slightly dulls individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causal drive lens holds strong with logical progression from investigation to closure. Closure is a decisive change (becoming keeper) with legible cost ("fate worse than liquidation"). The corporate threat persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like glowing soil and leaning trees constraining choices. The orchard and diamond charge the final image by filtering radiation into life, fulfilling the 9+ test for environmental impact on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. control) escalate through Maya's agency under causal lens, from discovery to protective decision. Cost is unmistakable in the liquidation risk, and one meaningful tightening (revelation from letters) forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hope and resistance emerges organically from events like the diamond's true nature, with subtext in the curse misconception. Ending offers a non-literal answer through Maya's hope, though the final hope message leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (observant debunker). Voice remains consistent, but no dialogue to test naturalism, and the prose lacks standout rhythmic innovation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story efficiently. Minor repetition of "sharply observant" stems creates a slight template cadence, but no artifacts harm closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic conspiracy with dimensional energy in a fresh, inevitable way. Specific details like the flawed diamond and stillpoints transform tropes, and risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes.</comment>
