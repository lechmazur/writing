<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied grief and purpose. Micro-choices under pressure, like descending during the outage, reveal his values. The final decision to continue hunting is earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation early. Closure lands as a decisive change: Elias transforms the crystal and commits to future hunts, with cost felt in "bleak exhilaration." The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and constraints like the observatory outage shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific, from the floating observatory to the ruined garden, with sensory details like ozone and decay. The environment constrains choices, such as using the pod for descent, and charges the final image of the amphitheater pool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: harvesting potential to forge a new future. Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from calculation to absorption, with cost legible in his transformation. One meaningful tightening suffices, though no major reversals occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss and possibility emerges through events and imagery, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the transformed crystal, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the geode's symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift, though some phrases are ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density. No major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, though minor overwriting exists in metaphors like "intangibly tangible."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (geode, potential harvesting) with organic integration. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in conceptual framework heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
