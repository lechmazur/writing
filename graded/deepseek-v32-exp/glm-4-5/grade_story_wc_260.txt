<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like caring for the chameleon. Her internal conflict is dramatized via contradictory impulses under pressure, and the final choice to balance self-respect with compassion is earned by prior causality. However, some emotional states verge on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "fragile convictions had shattered"), slightly reducing embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's transformed stance, under an accumulative/textural lens. The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The chameleon's tail tip serves as a persistent constraint shaping the final image, but the internal focus limits causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (e.g., mist, lantern light) and contributes to atmosphere, but it primarily mirrors internal states rather than constraining choices. The workshop and chameleon's tail tip charge the final image, yet the environment lacks tangible pressure on tactics, capping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal balance) escalates under the accumulative lens through Elara's reflective agency, culminating in a decisive stance change with visible cost. The tightening is driven by her choices, but the lack of external pressure or multiple reversals keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically through the chameleon metaphor and Elara's arc, with subtext in imagery and action. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, but occasional explicit statements (e.g., "reconstructing isn't about forgetting") slightly reduce resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elara's mindset. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the con's details) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in dense metaphorical passages (e.g., "shimmering stillness") slightly affects momentum but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of wildlife handling with personal betrayal feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in internal focus. The chameleon motif is transformed through specific details, but the core premise has familiar echoes, limiting ingenuity to the high 8s.</comment>
