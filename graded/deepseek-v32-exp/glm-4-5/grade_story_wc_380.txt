<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, tears) and micro-choices (digging despite resistance). Her final renunciation to rebury the crystal is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost in her lighter heart. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's tears and understanding, under a hybrid drive lens dominant in causal linkages. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with one continuous scene. Persistent constraint of gravity pockets shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the salt crystal chamber and beach constraining choices (digging resistance) and charging the final image. Sensory details (lantern light, crystal facets) are filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from routine to discovery, with cost legible in the sand's resistance and emotional release. Dominant stake (finding memories) tightens meaningfully, though secondary stakes are less pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (wildflowers, crystals), offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory transformation without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the whale's death revealing cosmic archives, deepening emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on patterns and silence. Voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., coffee ground interpretation) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("frozen light") is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion maintains momentum through closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes gravity pockets and memory archives with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
