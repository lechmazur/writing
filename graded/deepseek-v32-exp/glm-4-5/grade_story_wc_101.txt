<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in community resilience, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His relationship with Mira adds depth, but interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced. The final declaration is earned by prior causality, though lacks intense internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from sanctions to expansion declaration. Closure is a decisive change (declaration to expand food runs) with cost legible in "they will need more support." Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the terra-cotta arbor and bell recurring to charge the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "amplified quiet") reflect POV bias and urgency. The arbor constrains choices by serving as a council site, but spatial choreography is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) escalates through tightened sanctions and Elias's agency-driven declaration. Cost is unmistakable in the need for expanded support. One meaningful tightening occurs, but escalation is somewhat linear without deeper trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational resilience emerges organically from events and symbols like the bell, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor overtness in "tradition, our resistance" slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Mira's whisper). Prose texture is consistent, though minor register convergence in emotional peaks occurs without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud ear test passes with purposeful compression, such as in the final declaration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis of exile community and anonymous donations, transforming tropes through grounded choices. The premise feels fresh and inevitable, but risk-taking is moderate, leaning on familiar resilience narratives without bold structural innovation.</comment>
