<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply embodied with trembling hands and sorrow-filled eyes; his motivation to understand sensory triggers drives the narrative, and his final acceptance of grief is earned through prior causality with visible cost in tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias embraces grief, cost legible in his tears; the accumulative lens holds, with the ultraviolet revelation and orchid transformation creating a coherent, resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choice through the ghost orchid's timed bloom and charges the final image with the vial display; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in using the lantern, uncovering scent layers that deepen internal conflict; cost is unmistakable in his weeping and the foreclosed path of avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges organically from particulars like the vial and orchid; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of light and shadow intertwining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm; POV is stable and single, with elision (e.g., scent revelations) taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with varied syntax; no loops or artifacts obscure clarity, and figurative language serves the emotional peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lantern broker, ultraviolet light, and extinct plants feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
