<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion. However, internal contradiction is mild, and the final choice, while earned, lacks a deeply personal cost, leaning more on societal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the town transforms, with cost legible in "forests of second thoughts." The hybrid drive lens holds, and the magnetic grotto constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and mosaic structure with legible transitions fits Track B.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the magnetic grotto and cobalt library filtering through Arthur's POV and constraining choices by amplifying his ability. The grotto charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test with sensory specificity and atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Arthur's agency under the hybrid lens, from concern to planning and unveiling, with cost legible in the town's intellectual liberation. The dominant stake of intellectual freedom tightens meaningfully, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in whispers and displays, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the town's transformation, reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, such as "sacred space pulsed with starlight." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the unveiling scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes chess, psychic ability, and rebellion in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
