<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's interior conflict between tradition and change is concretely embodied through micro-choices like tracing graffiti and clutching the stone chip, with the final renunciation of personal guidance earned by prior causality. However, some emotional beats, such as the "revelation hit like a splash of cold water," edge toward diagnostic summary rather than fully dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as Maya returns the foundation stone chip, symbolizing collective power with felt cost under a causal lens. The plot escalates coherently from discovery to organized resistance, though the corporate resolution feels slightly convenient, mitigated by the on-page cost in Maya's stance shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating carnival setting is vividly specific with sensory details like clashing music and saltwater, and it actively constrains choices—the graffiti mural's pattern recognition directly shapes Maya's tactics. The foundation stone chip and graffiti recur to charge the final image of collective adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around gentrification escalate through Maya's agency, such as organizing flash mobs that demonstrate cultural value, narrowing options under causal pressure. The cost is legible in the "partial victory" and Maya's relinquishment of the chip, though the corporate compromise slightly reduces tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from encoded graffiti and Maya's arc, offering a non-literal answer on collective resistance without moralizing. Subtext operates through visual dialogue and the final spiral symbol, though the "culture shock absorber" line risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Maya's orderly intuitive mind filters setting details like the "neon constellations" graffiti. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and elision in the encoded messages is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing multiple layers like the graffiti's dual art and message roles. Minor template cadence occurs in lists (e.g., "music from a dozen floats clashed while the scent..."), but no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of encoded graffiti in a floating city feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes of resistance through specific details like nautical charts. Risk-taking in the mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image recharges prior motifs.</comment>
