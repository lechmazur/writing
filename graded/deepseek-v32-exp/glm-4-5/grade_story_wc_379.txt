<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and intensifies, driven by curiosity and community bonding. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, such as investigating the locket and deciding to share the letters.

Minor slip: some emotions are told rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot builds accumulatively through gathered stories, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the community heals through shared letters.

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the courtyard and locket acting as micro-settings that pressure choices and charge the final image.
