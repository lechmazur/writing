<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses; final choice is earned but cost is subtle. Embodied emotion is present, e.g., "trembled in their hands," but falls short of high-band complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the watch's normalization and distant laughter. Causality is tight, with the watch and cipher leading decisively to the library's appearance and the dreamer's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the mist and library's luminescence charging the final image. The library as micro-setting constrains choice by altering time perception and enabling entry, integrating purposefully with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation under hybrid lens is driven by agency (using the watch, documenting findings) and accumulative cipher fragments. Cost is legible in the vibrating watch and library's temporary access, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges through events and imagery, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "another unspoken truth." Subtext in the library's contents deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., cipher fragments) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural, supporting tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, but minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "spectral garments") slightly dulls momentum. No major loops or scaffolds; closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a non-obvious synthesis of quest and metaphysical library; watch's reversed cycles and cipher transform tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
