<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elion's spiritual curiosity and motivation to find strength in vulnerability are clear and consistent, driving his choices. His internal conflict is shown through embodied actions like using the lantern glass, and his transformation is earned by prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly acted out in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elion's understanding of vulnerability transforms, with cost legible in "forever changed." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the yellow glass acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tracking station and yellow lantern glass are vividly specific and constrain choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elion's POV, with the glass evolving to shape the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around Elion's search for understanding escalate through his agency in using the glass and stepping into the void, under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his transformation, though the escalation relies more on deepening than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability and interconnection emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elion's realization, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the empathic connection) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, but some figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "cosmic consciousness") risks overwriting without muddling clarity. No major loops or artifacts harm propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor premise offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like the lantern glass. Risk-taking in philosophical tone heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
