<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Druid's motivation is clear and consistent, driving choices under pressure with embodied emotion; final acceptance of truth is earned through prior causality, though interiority occasionally leans toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page with felt cost (seed drawing blood) and reconfigures stakes, though minor exposition in mentor's reveal slightly softens impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details integrate with action; setting (vortex, lake) constrains choices and charges the final image, with environment actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing mentor) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is legible in blood and plant withering, but escalation via circles feels slightly sequential rather than deeply transformative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth emerges through images and events without moralizing; ending offers non-literal resonance, though mentor's final statement borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, though minor register drift in peak beats slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; no major loops or scaffolds, but slight overwriting in figurative language near closure minimally dulls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements feels inevitable; core premise (frozen confession as identity) transforms tropes through specific choices, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
