<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surveyor's motivation as an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is clear and consistently drives his actions, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as plunging into the water and adding his note, earning the final resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a charged poise as the surveyor adds his note and reflects on his role, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in the "weighted responsibility"; the accumulative lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details (e.g., "marble pillars jutted from the placid waters") that reflect the POV's professional bias and enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the surveyor's agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the metal box to recovering it and adding his note, with cost legible in the "heavier" inkwell and his heightened responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and abandoned dreams emerges organically through concrete actions and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the surveyor's reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; the poetic, reflective voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "hushed blaze of oranges and purples," and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory preservation and coastal surveying, with risk-taking in its lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
