<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies under deadline pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "trembled with cautious exuberance," and her "carefully reckless" trait drives calculated risks. However, some emotional states are told rather than shown, slightly reducing depth. The final choice to present findings is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Elena prepares to present her translations, a decisive change with cost (permanent division if she fails). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from translation to discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the deadline tightens options persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly described with sensory details like "dust motes dancing in the afternoon light" and influences choices by providing key texts. The glass ink well functions as a micro-setting, but its constraint on choice is indirect. Specificity is purposeful, though not deeply charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing division) escalates through the approaching deadline, driven by Elena's agency in translating and discovering promises. Cost is legible as treaties would "finalize permanent division." Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs when the breakthrough forces her to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation emerges through interconnected promises and "symphonies of truth," not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bridges to be rebuilt. Subtext operates in implications of betrayal and forgiveness, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct scholarly voice; perceptual signature is clear in Elena's biased attention to texts. Rhythm controls pressure, e.g., "Hours passed as Elena worked." No head-hopping; purposeful elision in transitions is legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "symphonies of truth" is consistent and purposeful. Minor overwriting in repeated motifs doesn't obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of an arcane linguist healing divisions through ancient texts is a fresh synthesis; tropes are transformed via specific details like interconnected promises. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
