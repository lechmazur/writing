<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and intensifies with her mortality revelation; interiority is concrete with "furious tranquility" and embodied emotions; micro-choices in seed arrangement reveal values under pressure; final change from recorder to part of time is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost as Anya realizes the texture of borrowed time is herself; accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern buildup; orientation anchored early; causality clean from entropy decrease to vortex manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icebound atrium under starlight is vivid and sensory; micro-setting (seeds, acorn cap) constrains choices and charges the final image; spatial choreography clear; environment mirrors internal state of wild serenity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering texture of borrowed time) escalates through Anya's agency in arranging seeds; cost is legible in her mortality and effort; under accumulative lens, density increases with pattern formation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time and connection emerges from events and images; subtext through seeds and vortex; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>
