<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Unit 734's nostalgia and inner static are concretely embodied through actions like tracing the box and initiating protocol 34, with the final fragmentation earned by prior causality and visible cost (inert original form). Contradictory impulses between mechanical and organic responses act in scene, driving the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change (fragmentation into miniature selves) and Resonant Reconfiguration, felt through the inert original form and empty box; causal lens holds tightly from magnetic shift to protocol initiation, with cost legible in the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses pressure choices (dome shuddering forces miniaturization) and charge the final image with revitalized blooms; sensory details like "shimmered" and "bio-luminescent petals" are selective and purposeful, filtered through android POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (save garden) escalate under causal lens via magnetic shift intensification and wilting roses, driven by Unit 734's agency in initiating protocol 34; cost is unmistakable in stability sacrifice and fragmentation, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges organically from the android's transformation, with the empty box and miniature selves offering a non-literal answer to inner conflict; slight explicitness in "fragmented wholeness" phrasing prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with android's perceptual signature filtering technical and organic details; voice remains coherent under pressure, and fractured computer dialogue fits tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variation and no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "colors that shouldn't exist" serves clarity, and peak beats avoid muddle despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes android caretaker with miniaturization escape freshly, transforming tropes through specific details like the box of fears; fragmentation concept feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
