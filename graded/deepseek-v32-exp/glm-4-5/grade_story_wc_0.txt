<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation shift from cosmic to terrestrial is earned through concrete micro-choices like documenting decay, with interiority embodied in actions like collecting dust. However, the transformation feels slightly tidy, lacking deeper contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where Elena's realization reweights her worldview with felt cost in the final image of the emerging butterfly. Orientation is clear early, and pattern escalation is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "damp earth and decay" filtered through Elena's POV. Specificity is purposeful and mirrors internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of decay/renewal patterns, with agency in Elena's documentation foreclosing her academic path. Cost is legible in her humility, but escalation lacks a single tightening turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like dust patterns mirroring galaxies, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in decay/renewal motifs deepens the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable with distinct perceptual signature from scientific lexicon; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Minor elision in reflection is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "dust patterns that mirrored spiral galaxies" is coherent and advances momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and terrestrial through specific character choices feels inevitable; risk in quiet accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes common renewal tropes.</comment>
