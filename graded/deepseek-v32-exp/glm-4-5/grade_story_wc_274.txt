<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's internal conflict is concretely embodied through physical reactions like her struggling breath stabilizers, and her shift from preserver to liberator is earned by the discovery's weight. The final choice to upload the letter arises from contradictory impulses shown in scene, with visible cost. Minor telling in "bravely conflicted" is offset by strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elena uploads the letter, facing cryonic suspension—cost is legible in "she would face cryonic suspension or worse." Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to action, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of Federation control shapes her tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow constrains choice through isolation and cold, mirroring internal turmoil and charging the final image with revolutionary potential. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena's professional bias. The setting actively pressures her decision to leak the letter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, from discovery to the high-stakes decision to leak, with cost unmistakable in the risk of suspension. The dominant stake of truth versus control tightens meaningfully, foreclosing her duty path. Protagonist choice alters options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth control emerges from events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the letter's liberation. Subtext operates in whispers and silence, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elena's archivist role. Voice modulates under pressure, and rhythmic control is evident in phrases like "the echoing library under snow." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "ripples spreading outward" serves pressure without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of dystopian control and archival duty, transformed through specific details like cryogenic preservation. Emotional truth in Elena's conflict feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
