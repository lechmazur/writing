<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eli's steadfast pacifism is consistent and motivates key choices, with embodied emotion in tears and weightlessness, but lacks internal contradiction or flawed struggle, limiting higher excellence. Final action is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as spaceship dissolves; causal lens holds strong with clear linkages from preparation to stitching. Cost is legible in the final image of dissolution and transcendence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship constrains choices as sanctuary/lab and charges the final dissolution; sensory details like "ghosts of a million dead souls" are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear with escalation driven by Eli's agency in stitching; cost is visible in risk of dimensional collapse. One meaningful tightening under causal lens suffices, though secondary conflicts are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassion emerges through events and images like tears and sacrifice, not statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though some abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear in biased observation, but dialogue is absent, limiting full range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear with high information density; no major artifacts or loops. Rhythm supports emotional beats, though minor purple phrasing like "spectral ghost" slightly dampens peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with non-obvious synthesis of pacifism and transcendence; specific details avoid cliché, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
