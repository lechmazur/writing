<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hemingway's motivation is clear and rooted in his synesthesia, compelling his quest. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in his perception of sounds as colors. The final choice to use his gift for others is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the key dissolves into his skin, reconfiguring his role under a Hybrid lens. Causality is strong from inciting incident to revelation, with orientation anchored early. The final image of multicolored light charges the ending with conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, from the pier to the sunken library, with sensory details like glowing books. The key object constrains choice by opening the door and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports the mystical tone consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Hemingway's quest to understand his gift, escalating through his agency in finding the key and entering the library. Cost is legible in his vow and the key's dissolution, tightening under the Hybrid lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the connection between sound and color, with subtext in the librarian's words.
