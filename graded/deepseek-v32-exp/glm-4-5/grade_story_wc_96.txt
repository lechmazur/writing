<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure with embodied emotion and micro-choices. His molting personalities and fragmented memories add depth, though some interiority edges toward abstraction without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the poet's persistent rebuilding under the moon reweights stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the structure's shards cohere without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV bias. Specificity is vivid and purposeful, integrating decay and starlight into the narrative's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting knowledge escalates through the poet's agency in rebuilding, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in fragmented memories and persistent effort, though escalation is more deepening than tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through beauty emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in gestures like the coffee tin's seeds. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic diction, and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without major artifacts. Some figurative language risks overwriting but serves purpose; no loops or scaffold obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of molting personalities in a decayed library feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specificity anchors universals without derivative echoes.</comment>
