<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcel's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, and his final realization is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the workshop tilt and emotional turbulence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost; accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build to Marcel's kintsugi insight, and persistent constraints like the charm and statue shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the floating workshop and statue constrain actions and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Marcel's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcel's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the workshop tilt and emotional resonance; stakes tighten meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges organically from events, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through symbols like the statue and charm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a perceptual signature; POV is stable and prose reflects Marcel's mind under pressure, with rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
