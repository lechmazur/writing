<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict as an affectionate skeptic is concretely embodied through actions like tracing the geode and documented somatic markers, with motivation rooted in her brother's condition driving higher-stakes choices. The evolution to determined conviction feels earned by prior causality, though the cost of her brother's trapped state is more implied than sharply felt in closure. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Maya devising the protocol, under a causal lens with because/therefore linkages from the static shock to geode activation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the cost—her brother's suffering—is legible yet not intensely felt at the ending, reducing impact. The lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details like crystalline light patterns integrated into action. Selective POV filtering reflects Maya's priorities, and the geode's evolution from object to compass supports the 9+ test by directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing pill victims—escalates through Maya's agency under the causal lens, with meaningful tightening as geode patterns reveal neural networks and force protocol development. Cost is legible in references to synaptic chaos and her brother's trapped mind, though the trade-off isn't deeply visceral. Protagonist-driven escalation satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through skepticism and belief emerges organically from events like the geode's interactions and somatic markers, with subtext in Maya's internal battle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her transformation into a believer in human potential, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction ("willowglass hope") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression in experimental beats is taught and legible, and minimal dialogue carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift, though voice could be more idiosyncratic in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold, with figurative language like "fractally precise" serving character and momentum. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in dense descriptions. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy pill recall, geode properties, and somatic markers with originality, transforming tropes through specific character stakes and world logic. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking, and the closure feels inevitable from established patterns. Fresh inflection in the protocol's development heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
