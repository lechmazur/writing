<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's internal conflict between isolation and duty is vividly embodied, with micro-choices like tracing the doorknocker ring revealing her hierarchy of values. Her decision to help is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her solitude with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and contradictory under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as she steps through the threshold, costing her isolation but fulfilling her purpose. The causal lens holds tightly from the ring's pulsation to her action, with orientation anchored early. The final image of "linking through scars" reconfigures options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary and starlight setting constrains choice by defining her isolation, while the doorknocker ring charges the final image. Sensory details like "cold, distant starlight" and "mist in the chilled air" are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal conflict to active duty through her agency, with the ring's warmth forcing a tightening choice. The cost of leaving solitude is legible on the page, narrowing options under the causal lens. One meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like ashes and scars, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "linking through scars," reweighting isolation with connection. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, not direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, lyrical texture that modulates under pressure. Dialogue at the end is natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent, though minor convergence in emotional peak with the other character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "memories turned to ash" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of isolation and healer tropes through specific details like the fading threshold. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
