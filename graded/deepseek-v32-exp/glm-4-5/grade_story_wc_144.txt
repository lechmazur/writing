<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's blindness is integral to his characterization, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing micro-fractures "as if reading a braille." His motivation to decode feedback drives the repair, and the final choice to mend the drone maintains connection with visible cost, earning the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the drone's return reconfigures the teacher-student relationship across distance, with cost felt in the separation. The Accumulative lens holds, building through light refraction patterns and mist, and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and water bowl constrain choice by enabling Elias's unique diagnosis method, charging the final image of connection. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "mist drifted through his open doorway," creating a cohesive atmosphere that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, as the repair process tightens with the live clock of the ship's departure, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the purposeful work against time, though stakes remain internal and low-key, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions and images, such as the drone repair symbolizing mended relationships, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer to connection and perception, with subtext in "guided by his skilled hands" reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elias's blindness, evident in phrases like "feeling the micro-fractures." Prose rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., light refraction mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere, as in "the depot's mist seemed to slow time itself." Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using light refraction for repair feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in a quiet, atmospheric story. Specific details like the artificial hummingbird drone transform familiar tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
