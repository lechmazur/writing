<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong with embodied emotions and internal conflict; her transformation is earned through the scrimshaw's influence, with visible cost in leaving her old life. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final choice is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot causality is tight with the scrimshaw triggering events; closure lands decisively as Mara dives into rebirth, with cost felt in her disappearance. The inferred hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details; the sublittoral fringe and scrimshaw micro-setting charge the final image and constrain choices. Specificity is purposeful and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal emptiness to transformative freedom; Mara's agency in using the scrimshaw drives the climax with unmistakable cost. Escalation under the hybrid lens is meaningful and tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-discovery emerges organically through imagery and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV; prose reflects Mara's perception and emotional state consistently. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature is clear under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through character-driven choices; risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with inevitable synthesis and heightened stakes.</comment>
