<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and consistent, driving her actions from discovery to display. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "heart quickened" and "pensive mirth," though internal conflict lacks deep contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure, such as using her light-therapy kit, reveal values, but flaws are mild, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Amelia's joy resurfaces and the community revives tradition, cost legible in "elderly visitors wept." Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from fragment discovery to exhibition. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the fresco fragment as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "fog-choked ruins" and "smooth and cool" fragment filtering through Amelia's POV. The fresco fragment acts as micro-setting, constraining choices by requiring light therapy and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across transitions, though other senses could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy escalates through Amelia's agency under causal lens: finding fragment, revealing images, and creating display each tighten options. Cost is felt in her emotional investment and community response, but could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening forecloses her path of despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reconnecting past and present through art emerges organically from events like the fragment's revelation and display, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in "mists preserve more than they destroy" and the ending image of "art illuminated the fog-bound hearts" offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Amelia, with distinct perceptual signature as an artist noticing "impossible colors" and light. Voice is consistent and lyrical, e.g., "liquid dawn," and elision like "exposed film" metaphor is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere efficiently. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "painting with light" is purposeful and clear. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise of artist using light to reveal hidden history offers fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like "paints with light" and Festival of Blossoms. Turns feel earned from character choice, and emotional authenticity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in method heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
