<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., quartz eye aching in sympathy) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final action of planting the seed is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the seed symbolizing new growth), under an Accumulative lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard setting constrains choice (apples out of reach prompt the bridge) and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. Micro-setting elements like the bag and ribbon are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with persistence narrowing options and leading to the symbolic bloom and seed. Cost is legible in her emotional and physical effort. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deciduous vows and persistent wisdom emerges through events and symbols (ribbon, seed, bridge), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with elision taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements (quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard), transformed via specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in symbolic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
