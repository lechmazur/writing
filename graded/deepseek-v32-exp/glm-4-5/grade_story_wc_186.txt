<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her retrocognitive gift, driving her to rekindle the beacon. Her emotions are embodied (e.g., "trembling hands"), and her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, internal conflict and contradictory impulses are underdeveloped, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (the fragile light and thistle-blown hope), and the causal lens holds strong. The prism's alignment with the North Star as a decisive change is motivated by Elara's knowledge and actions, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and broken prism are vivid and purposefully integrated, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like starlight resonance are selective and enhance atmosphere, though spatial choreography is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) escalates through Elara's agency, culminating in the prism alignment. Cost is legible in the temporary nature of the light, narrowing options and reweighting possibility under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the shard of hush revelation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about connections across time. Subtext in silence and light avoids moralizing, with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in selective perception and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the dream of the shard) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and evocative, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language (e.g., "thistle-blown hope") enhances without muddle, and propulsion supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-collapse custodian and retrocognition, transformed through specific details like star tracking. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
