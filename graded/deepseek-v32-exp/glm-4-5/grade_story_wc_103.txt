<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and consistent, driving her choices. Interiority is concrete, such as her experience of being "retrocognitively trapped," though phrases like "terrifying yet intoxicating" verge on stock emotion. Her final merger with the garden is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in disintegration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara merges with the garden, a conceptual repricing with cost legible in her disintegration. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and density. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with taught transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, evolving with Elara's perception. Sensory details like "vibrant green tendrils" are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. Hyperbolic geometry is integrated into action, shaping navigation and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she navigates time using hyperbolic geometry, deepening stakes. Cost is unmistakable when she disintegrates, foreclosing her connection to reality. Pressure coheres through pattern breaks and cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time as a tapestry emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in her merger. Subtext operates in fading photographs and garden shifts, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on geometry and time. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "quaking reverie," and purposeful elision is taught early. No head-hopping; prose reflects Elara's state coherently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "terrifying yet intoxicating" but no major artifacts or loops. Sentence-level propulsion is clear, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes hyperbolic geometry and time exploration in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the living bridge garden. Risk-taking in closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
