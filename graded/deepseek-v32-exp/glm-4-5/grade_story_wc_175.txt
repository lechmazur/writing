<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of remembrance is earned, though internal conflict is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) and felt cost ("weight of what was lost"). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with orientation anchored early and pattern taught throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the grotto and objects constraining choices and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the moth wing and threads are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transient signals. Dominant stake of honoring histories tightens meaningfully, though pressure is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in gesture and implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and advances story, clarity intact in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of ecological loss and remembrance, with risk-taking in accumulative structure. Specific details feel inevitable, transforming tropes through character.</comment>
