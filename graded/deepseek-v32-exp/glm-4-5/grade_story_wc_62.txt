<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover collective grief is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices, such as retracing steps with the ribbon and carving the monument. His internal conflict between individual sorrow and shared experience is dramatized without stock phrasing, and his final choice to honor collective grief is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The spectral mentor adds depth without overshadowing Elias's agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with shards (greenhouse, garden walk, carving) cohering into a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The monument for collective grief acts as a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the premise with cost legible in the villagers' response. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of motifs teaches the design by the midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices, such as the butterfly migrations guiding Elias's journey and the glass panes rattling with thunder. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, and the environment charges the final image of the completed monument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elias's agency in retracing steps and carving, deepening the stake of understanding collective grief. The cost is felt in his renewed purpose and the villagers' absorption of grief, though the pressure tightens rather than forecloses options directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the ribbon, butterflies, and poems, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief through the monument image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the mentor's final words deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending meditative focus with poetic rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure, such as in the garden walk scene, and any elision (e.g., spectral mentor's origins) is taught and paid off. Minor rhythm variations exist but do not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere without major artifacts. Figurative language ("thundering calm") is coherent and purpose-driven, though minor overwriting in dense passages slightly reduces momentum. No loops or scaffold obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image of collective grief is uniquely grounded in character.</comment>
