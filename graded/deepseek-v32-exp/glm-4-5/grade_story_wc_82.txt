<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like selecting the heart-shaped gem. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, leaning more on summary of past grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost in the tears and emotional release; accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery. The glass basilica as a vault persistently constraints tactics, and the final ascension reconfigures stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the glass basilica and gems constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like "polishing gems" and "transparent spires" are filtered through POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "tears of relief and sorrow." The dominant stake of grief tightens through the transformation action, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges through particulars like origami cranes and dream recording, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm and controlled diction; POV is stable and elision is taught early. No head-hopping, and prose reflects the character's mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "luminous torment" is purposeful and clear, supporting propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream recording and grief transformation feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style. Specific details like gem polishing and floating isle avoid derivative premises, heightening stakes.</comment>
