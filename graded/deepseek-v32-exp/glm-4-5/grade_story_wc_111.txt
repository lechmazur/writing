<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices like polishing marbles. His endurance and acceptance of the cycle are earned, with visible cost in his withered state mirroring the garden's blooming withering. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Earned Stasis—Elias's satisfaction and the garden's response reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the marbles' recurrence charges the ending. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in lens persistence, but closure lands solidly with cost legible in the final whisper and rustle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the garden maze constraining choices (e.g., pathways shifting with emotion) and charging the final image through sensory details like leaves leaning and marbles glowing. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's POV, and spatial choreography is coherent, elevating it to exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, such as placing marbles and preparing for scientists. Cost is legible in his aging and the garden's cycles, but the escalation lacks a sharp tightening or foreclosed option, limiting higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mended deception emerges organically through events and images like cracked marbles, with subtext in the garden's behavior. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but minor thematic echo in Elias's whisper slightly reduces originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective voice filters details through Elias's bias. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure. Brief convergence in tone with the garden's response is intentional, but voice could be more modulated under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the closure. Read-aloud test passes with elegance and purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing measurable luck and mended deception with specific, grounded details like cracked marbles. Tropes are transformed through character and setting, but premise has echoes of familiar nature vs. science themes, limiting risk-taking.</comment>
