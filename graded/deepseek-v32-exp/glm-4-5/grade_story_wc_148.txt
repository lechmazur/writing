<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape his father's legacy is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority like tracing the lattice and practicing truth. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final shift to writing his story is earned with visible cost in isolation. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hovering between past and present, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the son finds his voice and the lattice bears his story. Cost is legible in the final image of the lattice testifying to redemption. Pattern of repeated phrases like "copperlight repose" teaches early and pays off, with orientation anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lighthouse prison and lattice constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "copperlight repose" and "scent of salt and sorrow" are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action. The lattice as micro-setting alters tactics and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption escalates under accumulative lens through pattern density increases, leading to agency in writing his truth. Cost is visible in his isolation and effort, foreclosing paths. However, escalation relies heavily on internal reflection rather than external pressure, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and truth emerges organically from images like the lattice and wolf cry, with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the son whispering truth, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the lattice absorbing whispered promises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control, using repeated phrases like "through the scuffs" purposefully. Patterned elision is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping, but minor convergence in emotional peaks slightly reduces distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with vivid imagery like "light cutting through the darkness like a knife." Intentional repetition of phrases creates a lyric pattern, but minor template cadence in some beats (e.g., "He would hover...") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of the "boy who cried wolf" trope through specific setting and character depth. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and turns feel earned in hindsight. The lattice and lighthouse prison are irreplaceable, with transformation test passed.</comment>
