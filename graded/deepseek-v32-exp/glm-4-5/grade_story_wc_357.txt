<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arion's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with embodied emotions under pressure. The realization about the arrow tip is an earned epiphany that compels higher-stakes choices. However, some interiority leans toward stock phrasing, such as "whirling silence" repeated, slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from inversion to discovery. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the final image of wisdom gained for future generations. Orientation is anchored early, and the plot structure tightens meaningfully toward the echoes' revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with floating arches and inversion hour constraining choices like navigation by water flow. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the First Arch. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding resilience escalates under causal lens through Arion's agency in navigating and discovering echoes. Cost is legible in the trade-off of risk during inversion for transformative knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs at the First Arch, foreclosing ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and adaptation emerges organically from events like the arrow tip's glow and echoes' visions, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the imprint of wisdom, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Arion's professional observations. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., echoes' origins) pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story efficiently. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "silver serpents" is coherent and enhances momentum. Minor repetition of "whirling silence" does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravity inversion and ecological resilience feels inevitable, with specific details like the arrow tip's transformation from trinket to key. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is fully committed to its implications.</comment>
