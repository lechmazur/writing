<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice is earned by prior causality, though minor stock phrasing ("dappled resolve") slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (discovery of the channel system) and felt cost (trembling with excitement). Causal lens holds strong, with events linked through discovery and innovation, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (amphitheater's structure guides water flow) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in emotional tremors and the solution's trade-offs. Dominant stake (harmonizing values) tightens meaningfully through discoveries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in "encrypted compassion." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("building breathed," "dappled light"). Voice modulates under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, but minor scaffold issues ("dappled resolve" repeated) and slight overwriting limit the score. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of engineering and history, with earned turns and specific details. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
