<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply interior with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her motivation to discover the texture of time intensifies credibly, and the final realization is earned through the pause and reflection, with visible cost in her research transformation. The jade cicada pendant adds depth without being crutch-like, and her contradictory impulses are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as Maya's insight reconfigures her approach; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, driven by pattern and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the funding constraint persistently shapes tactics, landing the ending with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient grotto and tidal pools are vividly specific and charge the final image by facilitating Maya's clarity; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment constraining choice through the reflective pause that alters her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through a cadence shift in the pause, leading to Maya's agency in redefining her research; the cost is legible in her embrace of uncertainties, and the dominant stake (funding scarcity) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition periods emerges organically through images and events, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, anchored in the tidal pools and jade cicada's metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose is lyrical and reflective, matching Maya's voice, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the clarity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is integrated purposefully, and sentences advance story without muddle, though minor elegance prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada, and time texture feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar archetypes slightly.</comment>
