<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her adaptive approach and backstory with the locket deepen her character, and Lila's breakthrough feels earned by prior causality. The relationship serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter its state by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Lila speaking and hugging Maya, a decisive change with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Causality is clear, with the eclipse serving as a catalyst, and orientation is anchored early. The lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the emotional weight of the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with selective, purposeful sensory details that reflect POV bias and pressure choices. The sage ridge and activity room constrain actions, such as going to the ridge for the eclipse, and the locket charges the final image. Environmental details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of helping Lila find her voice escalates under the accumulative lens through the eclipse event, driven by Maya's agency. The cost is legible in Lila's emotional breakthrough, and the tightening forecloses options with visible price. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lila's words and the shared moment, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Prose has a lyrical texture, and dialogue is natural when present. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, with voice consistency throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in phrases like "cautious exuberance blossoming" slightly dulls clarity, but no major artifacts or loops harm closure. Rhythm supports scene needs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of music therapy, eclipse, and healing feels fresh and specific, with tropes transformed through grounded details. Emotional truth is strong, and risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
