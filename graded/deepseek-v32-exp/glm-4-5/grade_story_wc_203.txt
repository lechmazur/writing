<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from observation to decisive engagement. His interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like analyzing dust patterns revealing character under pressure. The final choice to transform his burden into a calling is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. However, minor tell-y moments like "his obsession" slightly reduce immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Marcus reconfigures his burden into a calling, bridging worlds. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and patterned escalation to the timed event at 4:17 PM. Orientation is clear early, and constraints like the mainspring barrel shape tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory details like "decades-old popcorn" and "flickering lights," filtered through Marcus's professional POV. The abandoned ticket office and mainspring barrel constrain choices and charge the final image, enabling the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent, and atmosphere supports the thematic tension between worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering hidden truths—escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases (e.g., dust patterns, device discovery) and the cadence shift at 4:17 PM. Marcus's agency drives the tightening, culminating in his engagement with spirits, with cost legible in his transformed burden. However, the cost could be more visceral to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—burdens, façades, connection—without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery like "cracks in the façade" and the "weightless burden," with the ending offering a non-literal answer through acceptance. Earned wisdom arises from Marcus's struggle, and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Marcus's expertise—noticing vibrations, dust patterns—and lyrical prose. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., timed silence) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal thought is consistent and character-specific, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "dust dancing in the dim afternoon light." No significant loops or artifacts, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "weightless burden" slightly reduces clarity. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-seeing, elevator repair, and horology with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through grounded details like dust analysis and the mainspring barrel. Risk-taking in genre blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures meaning with emotional specificity.</comment>
