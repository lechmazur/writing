<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and prudent adventurousness are concretely embodied, with internal conflict driving key choices; her final step through the portal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning her world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost as Elara leaves her familiar world; causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to spatial mutiny, and the nexus setting constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, from the narrow tunnels to the starlit nexus; the compass point and environment directly constrain choices and charge the final portal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of freedom escalate through Elara's agency under causal lens; cost is legible in her abandonment of the underground world, foreclosing that path with palpable tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion and sacrifice emerges organically through events and imagery; the portal's revelation reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, and elision (e.g., church organ memory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with no artifacts touching closure; figurative language like "air grew thick and viscous" serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny concept is freshly synthesized with character-driven stakes; risk-taking in the portal's reveal heightens coherence without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
