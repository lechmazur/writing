<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The diver's internal conflict is embodied through concrete struggle with new knowledge, and the statue's incisive kindness is shown through telepathic guidance. Micro-choices under pressure reveal value hierarchies, such as the diver's decision to open the ampoule. The final understanding is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in embracing nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the diver's shifted perspective. The hybrid drive lens (causal and accumulative) holds, with revelations building like sediment. Orientation is clear early, and the ampoule's use decisively shapes the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater garden constrains choices and charges the final image with bioluminescent corals and crumbling ruins. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the diver's POV. The ampoule and environment actively shape the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, with the diver's choice to open the ampoule forcing a trade-off between certainty and nuance. Cost is legible in the diver's emotional shift and the statue's fulfillment. The dominant stake (certainty vs. ambiguity) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the ampoule's shifting liquid representing non-absolute truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tapestry metaphor, without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, deepening reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet urgent prose. Telepathic dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Rhythm and diction control under pressure heighten emotional beats, such as "thread the truth through structural weakness."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting occurs in descriptions. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with revelations, supporting closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes living statue, underwater city, and telepathy with fresh specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
