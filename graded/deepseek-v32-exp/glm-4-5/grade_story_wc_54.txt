<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like pocketing the sextant and rerouting power. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "stoic determination despite the wonder." The final commitment to hope is earned through prior causality, though lacks deep internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in Maya's renewed purpose and the inscriptions' discovery. Causal lens holds strong from exploration to power restoration. Orientation is clear early, and no plot breaks harm coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "dusty console" and "flickering lights," constraining choices as Maya uses the terminal's resources. The sextant and power center charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's agency in rerouting power, leading to a meaningful tightening with cost in her effort and discovery. Dominant stake of hope is signaled early and tested under causal pressure, though escalation is linear without major reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hope emerges organically through the sextant's reweighted meaning and the terminal's resurrection, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in inscriptions avoids moralizing, but "equation for hope" nudges toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature reflecting Maya's engineer mindset. Voice is consistent and descriptive, though no dialogue tests naturalism. Elision is purposeful, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "lights... like stars awakening" enhances without muddle. Sentence propulsion supports momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of engineering and hope in a liminal space, with specific details like the sextant and power systems. Transformation of tropes feels inevitable, though not radically innovative.</comment>
