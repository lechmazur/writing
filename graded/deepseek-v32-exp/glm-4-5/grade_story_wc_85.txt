<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martin's guilt and motivation are concretely embodied through tactile details like the watch hand and trembling fingers. His internal conflict between deception and truth drives the narrative, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., sifting carvings) revealing his values. The final renunciation of his business is earned by the climactic discovery, showcasing a credible endurance with visible cost in his tears and lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with Martin's reconciliation of the watch hand and carving reweighting his past with undeniable cost. The lens holds from dusk to discovery, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of the driftwood carvings shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vividly filtered through Martin's POV, with sensory details like "cool metal" and "moonlight" reflecting his urgency. The watch hand and carvings function as micro-settings that constrain his choice to sift and charge the closure by revealing his grandfather's acceptance. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation builds through density increase as Martin's sifting leads to the carving discovery, narrowing his options from deception to truth. Agency is clear in his active search, and cost is legible in the "tempered regret" and tears. However, the stakes tighten primarily in the final beat, lacking earlier mid-scene pressure points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the watch hand and carvings, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of reconciled objects, reweighting inheritance as acknowledgment rather than acquisition. Subtext operates in gestures like tracing the watch hand, deepening emotional honesty without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sieved hush" that reflect Martin's biased attention. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., past reflections) is anchored in present cues. Minor register drift in "tempered regret" slightly offsets peak clarity, but no head-hopping or convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "sieved hush" is pattern-taught and pays off. Syntax varies purposefully, and closure image is undimmed by muddle or overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The black market genealogist premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory and morality, transformed through specific details like driftwood carvings. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Bold choices in emotional specificity avoid middle-ground hedging.</comment>
