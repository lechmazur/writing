<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits as an insurgent grandmother; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling "the ancient energy pulse through her fingertips." The final choice to evolve tradition is earned by prior causality, and her internal conflict—dismissing prophecies then accepting them—shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the cost of her struggle is visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal, with because/therefore linkages: plant telepathy leads to discovery, decoding script unlocks chamber. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the embryo's release reconfigures tradition—anchored on-page in "the reconstruction could now truly begin." Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: volcanic hot springs provide geothermal power and guide choices through plant telepathy. Sensory details like "warm volcanic rock" and "steam hissed" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment constrains the final image—the chamber opening—and charges the closure with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition) escalates under Causal lens through Maya's agency: decoding the script tightens options and forces the unsealing with cost. The climax is driven by her choices, not coincidence; cost is legible in her effort and the embryo's purpose. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events—tradition evolution through intent—without moralizing; subtext operates in plant whispers and kite script. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the embryo's purpose "not to replace tradition, but to evolve it." Earned through struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: Maya's attention to plants and energy reflects her character. Voice is consistent, and elision (e.g., decoding process) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density; sentences advance story without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "The chamber cracked open with a sound like thunder." No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and momentum maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and amber embryo feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure reweights prior material with undeniable coherence.</comment>
