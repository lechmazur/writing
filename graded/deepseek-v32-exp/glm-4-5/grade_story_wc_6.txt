<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her paradox as an arsonist's daughter turned firefighter, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as protecting the grafts. However, her compassion feels slightly idealized, lacking deeper internal contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maya achieves renewal, with cost legible in the surrounding destruction and her efforts. Causal lens holds strong, driven by her decisions, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the obsidian lagoon and black sand recurring to charge the final image of transformation. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Maya's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, as she actively protects the grafts from advancing flames, with cost visible in the destruction. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, though the resolution relies slightly on weather patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through concrete actions and symbols like the grafted roses, with subtext in the coin and sand. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some motifs are reiterated overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Maya's mindset. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though minor purple hues appear in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing paradox with botanical detail to create inevitability. Risk-taking in structure and symbolism heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it echoes familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
