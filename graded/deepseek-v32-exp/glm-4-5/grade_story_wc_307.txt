<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elien's backwards aging and Maya's student role are well-motivated, with clear interiority shown through confusion and understanding. Micro-choices like withholding truth and throwing the stone reveal hierarchy of values. Final comprehension is earned through causality, with cost in Elien's aging reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from setup to closure, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change as Maya transforms and Elien ages backwards, cost legible in "a decade return to his body." Magnetic grotto and ripples serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "sycamore leaves whispered" and "magnetic grotto pulsed with light" are selective and purposeful. The floating rock and grotto constrain choice by enabling the lesson's revelation, charging the final image with starlight penetration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Maya's learning escalates through her agency—demanding "Show me" after stone-throwing—leading to understanding. Cost is felt in her transformation and Elien's payment, narrowing options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing to appear emerges organically from concrete events like the stone sinking and grotto revelation, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maya's whispered comprehension, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with poetic voice like "sycamore hush" and distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Maya's demand, and elision in trance perception is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "patterns in the rings" is purposeful and clear, accelerating with scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of backwards aging researcher teaching vanishing is a fresh synthesis, inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in mystical concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like magnetic grotto avoid template plots.</comment>
