<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like her chest tightening. Her final choice to submit findings is earned by prior causality, with visible cost to her career. However, some emotional moments edge toward telling rather than showing, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Maya resolves to act, costing her career, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in her whispered statement and determined smile. The plot structure is tight, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like damp earth and mildew filtering through Maya's POV. The lantern acts as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, though the tunnel itself doesn't fully pressure tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, as her discoveries narrow options and raise stakes. The cost of career jeopardy is legible on-page, and the dominant stake of truth vs. safety tightens meaningfully through her empirical observations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the lantern symbolizing liberation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of freedom and corruption, though some connections are slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflecting Maya's analytical profession. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and minimal dialogue is natural. Minor density in prose doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and information density, with purposeful figurative language. No major artifacts, but minor repetitive phrasing like "watchfully calm" appears without harming closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical artifact with modern corruption feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in theme heightens stakes, though it doesn't fully break new ground.</comment>
