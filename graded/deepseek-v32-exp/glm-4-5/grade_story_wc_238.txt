<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like tears tracing dust. Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the rheostat, reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to close the bottle and accept incomplete reconciliation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the incomplete composition left behind, making cost legible.
