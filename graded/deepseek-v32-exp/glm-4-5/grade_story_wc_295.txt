<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is clear and intensifies, driving choices. Interiority is present but some emotions like "tormented" are summarized rather than embodied. Collaboration with Dr. Thorne shows relationship dynamics under pressure, and the final shared burden is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong with telegram prompting star observation leading to decoding. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in shared burden and completion. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the ending image of dawn and solace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory setting is vivid and constrains choices through telescope use. Sensory details like "glass dome" and "daylily-pressed telegram" are purposeful. The setting charges the final image with dawn light, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes to decode healing wisdom escalate causally from dreams to collaboration. Agency is driven by Elara's actions, and cost is legible in the shared burden unlocking wisdom. One meaningful tightening is sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from events and collaboration. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through decoded wisdom and completion. No moralizing; subtext in imagery and silence enriches depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Elara's observations. Dialogue with Dr. Thorne is natural and goal-driven. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision in dreams and stars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; clarity and propulsion maintain momentum. Figurative language like "understanding dawning" is integrated without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lucid dreams, celestial patterns, and healing words feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details transform tropes; risk-taking in genre blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
