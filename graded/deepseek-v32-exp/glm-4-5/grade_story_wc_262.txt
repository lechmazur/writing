<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to find unused love is clear and rooted in her own heart as a repository, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to project the film and release the love is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tear and the hushed thunder. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with Elena's realization that unused love is transformed and stored in liminal spaces, costing her emotional understanding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the film strip as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Elena's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details like the celluloid and sprocket holes are integrated into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the accumulative lens, as her psychometry reading deepens to reveal the projectionists' memories, narrowing options and leading to the decision to project the film with cost legible in her tear. The dominant stake of releasing unused love is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the goodbye letters fused with film, offering a resonant non-literal answer about love stored in liminal spaces without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with earned wisdom from concrete particulars like the hushed thunder and final projection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, as Elena's spatially imaginative mind filters narration with poetic rhythm and controlled diction. Purposeful compression, like "forgotten lyrics searched for their tune," is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, with figurative language serving pressure and clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, as in "the dusty beam of light carried forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune," and no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes psychometry, film projection, and unused love in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyricism heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the silver halide crystals and phantom light avoid template plots, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
