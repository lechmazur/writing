<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in moments like feeling the "thrum of life." However, internal conflict is minimal, and some phrases like "weathered hands" edge toward stock description, preventing higher marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the seed transforms, cost is legible in "give pieces of oneself," and the accumulative lens holds. Orientation is clear early, and the waterfall's role reinforces the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, such as the waterfall's whisper and the seed's light, but the setting does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the pruner's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in the surrender and self-giving. The stake of preserving wonder tightens meaningfully through the weaving process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaving act and seed transformation, offering a non-literal answer to preserving wonder without moralizing. Subtext in images like the "rainbow upon the moss" enriches resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, such as "radiant hush," and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, though some diction is overly florid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density, but repetitive phrases like "verdant parapet" and "insatiably creative" introduce minor scaffold artifacts. No figurative muddle in peaks, but momentum dips slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes weaving between worlds and essence capture with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is grounded.</comment>
