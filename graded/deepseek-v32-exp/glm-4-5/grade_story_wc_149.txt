<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final dissipation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fading, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the bead's crumble and her release, cost felt under a hybrid causal-textural lens. Orientation is immediate, and structure tightens through the bead's activation driving the climax.</comment>
