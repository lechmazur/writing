<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elthion's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His preemptively nostalgic nature is shown through actions like cherishing moments before they pass, and his final vow is earned by prior causality with cost in transience. However, internal conflict is minimal, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elthion's purpose crystallizes, cost legible in "this moment was already becoming a memory." Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with environment shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like crystal whispers and shadow lengths constraining choices and charging the final image. The forecourt and monuments are integral to the narrative arc, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memory escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in examination of shadows and crystals. Agency drives escalation, with cost in nostalgia and effort, though external conflict is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges organically from particulars like crystals and shadows, with subtext in whispers. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of memory preservation with magical elements, transformed through specific details like summer-quills and solidified fog. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
