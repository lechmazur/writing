<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his blithe nature and curiosity about death, intensifying as he decodes the tapestry. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as his "small, soft smile" during absorption. The final revelation of sacrificial love is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with cost. However, his emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses under stress, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elias processes the sacrificial truth, charging the silo's gloom protectively. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned details to a decisive understanding. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the chess clock's reset signals ongoing cycles. Cost is legible in the gasp and processed revelation, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and cemetery setting constrains choices by absorbing sound and creating a cocoon for decoding. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "cobalt blue that absorbed starlight" and "velveteen gloom." The silo as micro-setting charges the final image with protective understanding. Specificity is high, with no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering intentions escalates under the accumulative lens through Elias's decoding, tightening as threads reveal secrets. Agency is clear in his careful work, leading to a reversal with the sacrificial revelation. Cost is felt in his gasp and the reweighted understanding of love. Pressure coheres without coincidence, but escalation is more deepening than dramatic tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love's persistence and sacrifice emerges organically from the tapestry decoding, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "sacrificial rather than romantic" realization. Subtext operates in echoes and imagery, inviting reflection without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the silo's transformed gloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elias's biased attention to artifacts and echoes. Prose rhythm varies naturally, supporting pressure without head-hopping. Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, so focus on narrative voice, which remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, as in "the velveteen gloom seemed to deepen." Figurative language is consistent and legible, avoiding muddle. Closure image is sharp, with clear propulsion and no register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener, uncharted echoes, and decoding tapestry feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices, like the sacrificial twist on love. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, anchored in particulars.</comment>
