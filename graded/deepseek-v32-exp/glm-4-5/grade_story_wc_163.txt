<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation for belonging is clear and consistent, driving her exploration. Interiority is concrete through embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as tracing the feather's origin. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her changed perspective. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Maya understands belonging as an eternal dance, with felt cost in her transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the feather's pull provides coherent linkage. Persistent constraints shape the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Maya's POV, such as the rusted equipment and bioluminescent patterns. The dome environment directly influences the climax, meeting the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative lens, as she follows the feather to the dome, deepening stakes. Cost is legible in her emotional revelation and the feather's transformation. However, the pressure relies more on texture than causal tightening, preventing a higher score despite clear cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through events and images, like the creatures mirroring constellations, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the cosmic dance metaphor. Subtext operates in implication, such as the feather's map guiding future connections, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Prose rhythm controls pressure, such as in the dome scene. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. However, minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops. Figurative language is purposeful, as in "shadowseam wonder." No major artifacts obscure closure. Slight overwriting in descriptive passages limits the score, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes astrology and underwater exploration with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes. The closure reconfigures belonging through lived detail, satisfying the 9+ test with a fresh angle.</comment>
