<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but lacks internal contradiction or flaws, reducing depth. Her actions under pressure reveal character, but the absence of genuine struggle or blind spots limits complexity. The final choice is earned through causality, yet no visible cost in internal conflict holds back higher scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the city awakens, cost felt in the silence and effort under a causal lens. Orientation is anchored early, and causality holds without breaks. The lunar perigee and shard of hush act as persistent constraints shaping tactics, but the cost, while legible, is subtle rather than unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the radio tower and gorge constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively pressures the climax, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, using the shard of hush and discarding assumptions to narrow options. Cost is legible in the silence and renewed purpose, but the stakes lack visceral intensity. One meaningful tightening occurs, though secondary pressures are absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, but the final paragraph states it explicitly ("every conclusion contains the seed"), triggering a -0.5 deduction for moralizing. The cosmic rebirth concept is resonant through image and action, yet the overt statement reduces subtextual impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature fitting Elara's role. No head-hopping or dialogue issues, but the prose occasionally leans toward overwriting without harming clarity. Rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and strong rhythm. Minor overwriting in phrases like "serenely electric" exists but doesn't muddle peak beats. No loops or scaffold issues; closure image is sharp and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of celestial interpreter, Hollywood star fragment, and shard of hush offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Concept is fully committed to, with specifics enhancing originality. Risk-taking in blending fantasy with practical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
