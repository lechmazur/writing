<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maia's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her rebellion against censorship. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "furiously tranquil expression" showing internal conflict. The final choice to write is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk she takes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through imagery and mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she writes. Closure lands on-page with cost in her defiance, and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory setting constrains choices by providing isolation, and it charges the final image with the star-sprinkled sky. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, reflecting Maia's POV and enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in the storm and her resolve, driven by her agency to write. The cost is legible in the risk of rebellion, and the stake of free expression tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the map of scars and uncensored stars, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to censorship through the power of poetry, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; the poetic voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "rarefy her thoughts") is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language like "storm-kissed wonder" is voice-motivated and clear, though minor overwriting exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a censored poet in an observatory feels fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
