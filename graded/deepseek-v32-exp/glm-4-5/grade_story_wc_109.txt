<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation evolves credibly from mild obsession to violent determination, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as sketching voids and comprehending her task. However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—the endless night as canvas—with felt cost in her smile and the glowing booklet. The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the star's vanishing and the map's completion, creating a before/after shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (storms, starlight, gold leaf) and micro-settings (booklet, pebbles) charge the final image and constrain choices, but the ridge fort itself does not directly pressure tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the oracle's agency as the star flickers and vanishes, forcing her to redefine her role with cost legible in her renunciation of prevention. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through silence and darkness, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end—endless night as beginning—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the ambered hush deepens implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., summarizing silence). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; closure image remains sharp. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of oracle tropes through summarizing silence and mapping darkness feels inevitable, with risk-taking in abstract themes that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (pebbles, booklet) avoid derivativeness.</comment>
