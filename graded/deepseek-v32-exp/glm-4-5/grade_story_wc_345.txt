<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elion's altruism and Aris's trust are clear motivators, but interiority lacks depth and contradiction; Aris's unwavering trust feels undramatized, reducing emotional complexity. The community's transformation is told rather than shown through embodied choices. Closure relies on collective action without individual cost, limiting character-driven stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with tight because/therefore linkages from messages to discovery and resolution. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the community's effort and renewed hope. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of barren soil shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with floating arches and orchards integral to the conflict. The butterfly garden watering bell constrains choice and charges the final image as a symbol of rebirth. Sensory details are selective and filtered through the world's logic, enhancing atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival escalates through Aris's agency in following messages and discovering the watering bell. Cost is visible in the collective effort and renewed vitality. Under causal lens, escalation narrows options meaningfully, though the cost feels somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust and community emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "strangers became family." Subtext operates in the ghost's guidance and the watering bell's symbolism, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person omniscient with a distinct, elegant voice and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., ghost's noncorporeal state) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum, especially in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of an altruistic ghost on an orchard planet is fresh and transformed through specific details like the watering bell and chalk messages. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the noncorporeal communication method heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
