<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and a credible arc from wound-opening to integration. The final choice is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her changed perspective. However, some interiority edges toward abstract therapy-speak, slightly diluting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens, with cost legible in "healing wasn't about opening wounds but learning to live within their stories." Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of objects and whispers coheres to charge the ending without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the tower stones matched by coffee rings force a tactical press. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like the "frosted hourglass" coldness, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency, as plant whispers and pattern deciphering tighten stakes toward integration. Cost is felt in her renunciation of excavation, though the shift from coffee rings to wall-pressing happens swiftly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like scars and the hourglass, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material through integration, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that holds under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., coffee ring deciphering) is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency slips in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. However, slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("meteor hush") causes minor muddle without harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing telepathy, objects, and closure-seeking into a non-obvious exploration of integration. Specific details like coffee rings as maps transform familiar tropes, though plant telepathy echoes common fantasy elements.</comment>
