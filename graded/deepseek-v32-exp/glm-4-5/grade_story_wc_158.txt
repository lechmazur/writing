<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, with insomnia as both curse and gift driving their actions. Interiority is concrete, such as trembling hands tracing the postcard, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in their sleepless nights and death. However, some phrases like "reef-shadow joy" edge toward decorative abstraction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the poet's lullabies integrate into the shell after their death, with cost legible in the poet's sacrifice. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored early. The galaxy postcard and insomnia persist as constraints shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell constrains choices by responding to the poet's lullabies with blossoms, charging the final image. Sensory details like pearlescent walls and bioluminescence are selective and purposeful, woven into action. The setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming pain into beauty escalates under the accumulative lens through the poet's agency, such as singing louder against darkness. Cost is unmistakable in the poet's insomnia and mortal journey. The blossom armistice deepens stakes, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the blossom armistice representing a truce between suffering and serenity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lasting lullabies and postcard, without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, like the poet's purpose crystallizing in silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice reflected in rhythmic syntax and perceptual signature (e.g., noticing "quiet intelligence" in constellations). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the centuries-long timeframe taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "photosynthesize pain" is consistent and legible. Minor denseness in phrases like "reef-shadow joy" does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and biological elements feels inevitable, with the blossom armistice transforming the lonely artist trope. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details, such as the galaxy postcard's journey, anchor authenticity.</comment>
