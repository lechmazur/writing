<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique trait, driving his actions consistently. Micro-choices under pressure, like using chalk and driftwood, reveal his values, and the final commitment to memory feels earned. However, internal contradiction is not deeply explored, limiting peak emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when he commits the sound to memory. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to the climax. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden constrains choices (e.g., fog necessitates driftwood markers) and charges the final image with the arch's sound. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action, enhancing atmosphere without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the sound) escalates under the accumulative lens through the prophet's agency, culminating in the arch's revelation. Cost is legible when he clings to the sound before forgetting, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time and memory emerges organically through particulars like the videotapes and arch, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sound's echo, reweighting prior material with profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and advances plot; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Elision (e.g., precognitive forgetfulness) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied syntax and clear propulsion. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is consistent. Minor register drift in phrases like "tidal longing" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, transforming tropes through specific details (e.g., precognitive forgetfulness). Emotional truth in longing for time's passage feels authentic, and risk-taking with abstract concepts pays off with coherence and closure.</comment>
