<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in artistic pursuit, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final action to play the piano is earned by prior causality, but interior contradiction could be deeper to heighten cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the music completes the ghost's song, with felt cost in the program's dissolution and peaceful silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., wading through water, the untouched piano). Sensory details are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image with the shimmering light and dissolved program.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (unraveling the ghost's code), and escalation is driven by Elias's agency to play the piano, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the program's dissolution and reconfigured silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending time emerges through particulars like the water-stained notation and wordless conversation, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on liminal spaces and music. Voice is lyrical and coherent, though dialogue is absent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of flooded opera house, ghost, and water-damaged music feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
