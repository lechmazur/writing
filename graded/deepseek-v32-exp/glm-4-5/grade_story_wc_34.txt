<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her childhood silence, driving her actions consistently. However, internal contradiction and embodied emotion are underdeveloped; her empathy is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final connection is earned but lacks visible cost in micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the harmonious connection between human and machine. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and imagery. The flower press plate acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and flower press plate are vividly rendered and essential, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception, though other senses could be more balanced. The setting evolves consistently with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes of connection and expression escalate through Elara's agency with the flower press plate, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the symbiotic harmony achieved, though the escalation lacks multiple reversals. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of articulating unspoken needs emerges organically from events and images, such as the graffiti and songs, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the interconnected expression, reweighting prior material with complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elara, with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the ghost's communication through glitches. Rhythm and diction control are consistent, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and sentence structures, but minor scaffold appears in repetitive stems (e.g., "The ghost..."). Figurative language is generally coherent, though some phrases verge on ornamental. No major artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes digital and ethereal realms with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices like the flower press plate. Risk-taking in blending realms heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight due to character-driven logic.</comment>
