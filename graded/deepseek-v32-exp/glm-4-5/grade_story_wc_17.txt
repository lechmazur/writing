<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her discoveries; embodied emotions (e.g., "heart quickened," "trembling hands") and earned commitment to Thorne's work show depth, though lacks contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in "weight of legacy's burden"; accumulative/textural lens holds through discoveries; orientation anchored early; persistent constraint of legacy shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("ivy-veiled passage," "cold surface") are purposeful and POV-filtered; setting charges the final image via the film negative but does not heavily constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in discovering diaries and film; cost is legible in her commitment to the burden; accumulative lens supports deepening without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy emerges organically from specifics; ending offers resonant non-literal answer ("what walls dream about") without moralizing; subtext in architectural memories enriches reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and literary; no dialogue, but elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original concept of echo cartography offers fresh synthesis; specifics ground emotional truth, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking transformative boldness.</comment>
