<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in rational rebellion; his interiority is concrete, as seen when he mutters to the pipes, and his decision to preserve the cog is earned through prior causality. However, he lacks significant internal contradiction or flaws that complicate choices, keeping him from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Milo pockets the cog, reaffirming his commitment; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layers of discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like murky waters and lantern light filtering through Milo's POV; the sunken city ruins constrain choices, such as navigating shifting passages, and the chronometer cog charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of knowledge preservation escalates through Milo's discovery and decision; under the Accumulative lens, agency drives a meaningful tightening when he chooses to preserve the cog, with cost legible in his resolved stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. forgetfulness emerges organically through events and images, like the cog's preservation offering a non-literal answer; subtext operates in Milo's actions, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, exemplified by "abrasive calm" and philosophical tone; minor repetitive phrasing in "rationally rebellious" slightly dulls voice, but no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and information density, but template cadence in repeated stems like "sedimentary layers" and "rationally rebellious" causes minor artifacts; no closure obscurity, and momentum remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and philosophical elements, with specific details like the chronometer cog transforming tropes; risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
