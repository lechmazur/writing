<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to belong is clear and drives the plot; her internal conflict between solitude and community is embodied in actions like proposing the search. The final dedication feels earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her unshed tears. Minor label-speak ("hollowness") is offset by concrete micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elara etching the sigil, reconfiguring her isolation into belonging with felt cost. Hybrid lens holds: causal links (search leads to discovery) and accumulative texture (relationships build) cohere. Orientation is immediate; the crater's constraints shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the crystalline orchard and crater pressure choices (treacherous climbs, reed pulleys) and charge the final image. Sensory details (luminescent fluid, transparent trees) are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging vs. isolation) escalate through Elara's agency in proposing the search, which tightens options and deepens relationships. Cost is legible in shared exhaustion and the sigil's realization, foreclosing her loneliness under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges through particulars like the sigil's discovery and the arbor's dedication, not statement. The ending reweights prior yearning into shared belonging without moralizing; subtext operates in group interactions and symbolic reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, yearning). Dialogue is minimal but natural; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Minor register elevation ("luminescent ache") is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("luminescent ache") is patterned and pays off at closure. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, though minor purple tinge persists without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reed sculpture, crystalline setting, and kinship webs feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the sigil's meaning. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements organically.</comment>
