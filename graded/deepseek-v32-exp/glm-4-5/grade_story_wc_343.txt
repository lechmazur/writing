<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistently drives his actions, with interiority shown through concrete observations and micro-choices. His diligence and curiosity are embodied in tracing the hopscotch board and cross-referencing with the phrasebook, earning the revelation. However, the characterization lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Eli's discovery of luminous pathway mapping, a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens. The cost is legible in his effort and the story's final image of ancient knowledge. Causality is tight, with observations leading logically to revelation, and orientation is clear early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the antique airship and hopscotch board constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the "dusty hopscotch board" and "swirling dance of starling murmurations" are filtered through Eli's POV, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Eli's agency under the causal lens, with his noting of patterns tightening options toward the discovery. The cost is felt in his diligent effort and the conceptual price of harnessing light, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the hopscotch cipher and luminance, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to discovery and patterns. Subtext operates through images and implication, avoiding moralizing, though it leans slightly toward straightforward execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and coherent with Eli's perceptual signature, and voice reflects his curiosity through selective detail. Dialogue is minimal but natural; however, the voice lacks distinct rhythmic control under pressure to reach higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythmically, and figurative language like "stranded luminance" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of map apprentice, hopscotch cipher, and stranded luminance feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with specific details elevating familiar tropes. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent, supporting stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
