<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recluse's tranquil perception is embodied through specific actions like gazing and sitting in silence, with motivation rooted in understanding ghosts and preserving unspoken words. The final choice to sit beneath the hive is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when the recluse becomes the keeper, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent through contextual clues. The cost is legible in the final image of the empty box and ghostly smiles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the abandoned oasis and scorched wasteland constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "sunlight fractured through cracked glass domes," integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the recluse's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with stakes tightening through contextual clues and the choice to sit in silence. Cost is visible in the recluse's transformation, foreclosing other paths. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and unspoken words emerges organically from images and events, such as the box's requirement and the recluse's mute eloquence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the release of the bee.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, observant prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., silent communication) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "forms shifting like smoke." Minor overwriting in descriptions doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic ghosts and beekeeping covenant, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
