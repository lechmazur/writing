<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final renunciation and endurance are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his exhaustion and the transformed landscape. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the coachman's exhaustion and the garden's renewal, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through the coachman's POV. The blooming jetty and barren landscape constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally with events, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring harmony) escalates through the coachman's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his labor and depletion of seed pods. One meaningful deepening occurs as bird calls guide his tactics, foreclosing options and reweighting stakes without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of restoration emerges through events and images like seed pods and bird calls, not direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and concision. Grammar and punctuation are clean, and syntax supports propulsion without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels organic and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise offers a fresh angle on familiar material, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
