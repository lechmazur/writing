<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her research drive, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as activating transposed empathy on Thomas. Her emotional embodiment and the cost of her isolation are legible, though minor flaws in blind spots limit the score. The final earned stasis with visible cost in Thomas's panic supports a high rating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with clear linkage: Elara's experiment causes Thomas's disorientation and her data collection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she continues her quest, with cost felt in Thomas's flight and stellar vanishings. Orientation is anchored early, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the topaz workshop and halo fragment constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere. The environment mirrors internal states, such as shadows reflecting disorientation, and is indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Elara's research escalates through her agency in disorienting Thomas, narrowing options under the causal lens. Cost is legible in his panic and her solitude, with one meaningful tightening. The conflict interweaves internal and external pressures, though secondary stakes are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quantifying emotion emerges through events and images like the halo fragment and vanishing stars, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's continued quest, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, and emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and character-specific, with dialogue advancing plot naturally. Purposeful elision in disorientation scenes is taught and paid off, and prose reflects Elara's mindset without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, such as "topaz workshop suspended between stars." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and the closure image is sharp without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes transposed empathy and mathematical emotion research with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Details are particular and transformative, avoiding template plots, and the closure commits fully to its implications.</comment>
