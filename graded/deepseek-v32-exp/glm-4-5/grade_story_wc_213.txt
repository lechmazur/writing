<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his actions with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the characterization lacks on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses, preventing a higher score despite strong traits and earned closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (bell ringing confirms hypothesis) and felt cost (Elias's satisfaction), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details that pressure choices (e.g., sanctuary isolation, bell rope repair). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (proving the hypothesis), escalation is driven by Elias's agency (setting the switch), and cost is legible in the climax. However, the conflict is internal and lacks external pressure, slightly limiting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (listening over noise) emerges through events and imagery, not statement, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is strong, but the theme is slightly overt in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and character-specific, though no dialogue is present to test full range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with varied rhythm and no significant artifacts. Minor purple hints in figurative language prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of old vs. new technology, with specific details elevating familiarity. However, it lacks bold structural risks, capping originality just below exceptional bands.</comment>
