<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion like "dawnlit melancholy." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the camera despite sadness, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, internal conflict is somewhat straightforward, lacking deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elena completes her mission, feeling the "weight of what she had witnessed," under an accumulative/textural lens. The impending sunrise escalates pressure coherently, and the sand grain's dissolution ties time to the climax. Orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "blue light" of fireflies, and it constrains choices by dictating the fireflies' emergence and extinction. The moonlit summit charges the final image, serving as a crucial vantage point that shapes the narrative outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: preserving the fireflies' last moments. Pressure escalates under the accumulative lens with the approaching dawn, driven by Elena's agency to outlast the night. Cost is legible when the fireflies fade, affirming the sacrifice for progress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of progress versus preservation emerges organically through events like the mining threat and Elena's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the preserved images, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the sand grain symbolizes time's passage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elena's melancholic observations. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the sand grain's role) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and rhythmic, with high information density—e.g., "The dawning hush intensified" advances atmosphere and plot. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences propel the story cleanly toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of lunar fireflies and a crater inspector is fresh, synthesizing extinction themes with a unique setting. Turns feel earned, but risk-taking is moderate, leaning on familiar emotional arcs without transformative innovation.</comment>
