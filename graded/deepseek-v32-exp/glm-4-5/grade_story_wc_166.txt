<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the narrative, with interiority embodied in dance; however, lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene, though final transformation is earned with visible cost in anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and cost in mobility sacrifice; accumulative lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice through anchoring and charges the final image; sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful, with the garden acting as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation under accumulative lens is driven by agency (dance, observation), with cost in anchoring legible on the page; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus forgetting emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic voice is distinct and consistent, POV stable; perceptual signature is selective and biased; no head-hopping, with purposeful elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with high information density; no major artifacts or loops; figurative language is cohesive and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; specific details and risk-taking in lyrical style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation is grounded.</comment>
