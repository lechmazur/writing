<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liam's motivation is clear and rooted in his childhood accident, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His resilient positivity constrains actions, and the final merger is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as timelines merge, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in Liam becoming a "permanent transient," and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the spectral grotto and ferry transformation constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "liquid starlight" are integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liam's agency under the causal lens, with the stake of merging timelines tightening through radio communication and pattern manipulation. Cost is visible in the hourglass filling and Liam's transformed state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unity emerges from events and images like the hourglass, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the merged realities. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and voice remains coherent under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though limited, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "shimmered like liquid starlight" is purposeful and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes time travel and ferry mythology with originality, transforming tropes through specific choices like the hourglass and interconnected patterns. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
