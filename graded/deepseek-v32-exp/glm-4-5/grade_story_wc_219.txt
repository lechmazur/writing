<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority showing concrete conflict. His final choice to place the amber is earned by prior causality, though some over-articulation in peak beats slightly reduces embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elian understands homecoming, with cost legible when he leaves the amber. Causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early, but minor ambiguity in lens application prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the rainwashed tower and sculptures constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens, with stakes tightening as he follows footprints and places the amber. Cost is visible in his renunciation, though one minor detour lacks full causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as recognition emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the fly amber and pilgrimage avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent and academic, though minimal dialogue limits subtext exploration. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overuse in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of skeptic, amber, and pilgrimage, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in blending science and spirituality heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
