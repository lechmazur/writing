<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like finding the tessera and renaming the city. Interiority is concrete through embodied emotions (e.g., tracing the tessera), but his character lacks deep internal contradiction, leaning slightly idealized. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as renaming "Samarkhand" reweights meaning with felt cost in the atmosphere shift. The lens holds throughout the memory buildup, and orientation is clear early. The mosaic tessera's return charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "cracked stones" and "shattered sky" filtering through Elias's POV. The plaza and tessera constrain choices and charge the closure, as the mosaic's patterns directly enable the ritual and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in memories, leading to Elias's agency in renaming. The stake of emotional renewal tightens, with cost legible in the transformed perception of ruins. No external conflict, but coherence maintained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy and resilience emerges organically through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in the renaming ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice reflective of Elias's mindset. Perceptual signature is strong in selective attention to ruins and memories. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when others gather.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story through concrete imagery. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "cradle empathy in arms of steel." Read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognitive renaming in a post-apocalyptic setting feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the tessera. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth is authentic.</comment>
