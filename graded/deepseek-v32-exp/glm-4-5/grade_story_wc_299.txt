<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like handling the cloth with reverence revealing his hierarchy of values. His final glimmer of passion is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his emotional shift from shame. However, some emotional states are summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Marcus's renewed passion. The Accumulative lens holds, building through memory layers. Orientation is clear early, and the cloth catalyzes a coherent before/after change. Minor ellipsis in backstory integration doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the quarry mirroring Marcus's internal void and the cloth constraining choice. Sensory details like the struggling air conditioner and dust reflect POV bias. The object charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering purpose after loss) escalates through Marcus's agency in authenticating the cloth, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in his emotional reconfiguration. However, escalation is subtle and relies heavily on reflection, limiting visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of purpose after loss emerges organically through particulars like the cloth and quarry imagery, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marcus's realization. Subtext in gestures and silence enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a melancholic, reflective tone. Perception is character-specific, and diction remains within Marcus's lexicon. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Line-level craft supports momentum, though minor summary in emotional beats slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ex-roadie, appraiser, and quarry setting feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
