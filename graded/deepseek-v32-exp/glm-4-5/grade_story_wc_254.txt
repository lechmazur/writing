<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with interiority like "heart pounding with anticipation." The transformation is earned through causal actions, but some emotions lean abstract, such as "tremor of certainty," slightly reducing concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the poet transcends boundaries, cost legible in "weight of new purpose." Causal lens holds firmly from touch to transformation, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the quartz colonnade constraining choice by serving as the gateway and charging the final image. Sensory details like "humming" and "shadows" are integrated through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes of artistic freedom escalate through poet's agency under causal lens, culminating in transformation with cost felt in "weight" and "lightness." One meaningful tightening occurs as options narrow through interaction with the colonnade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges organically from events and imagery, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Minor explicitness in lines like "proving that art and spirit could not be truly contained" slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature, e.g., "absorbing and reflecting the limited light." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure, though minor register consistency issues exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, e.g., "lantern-moth hush," and propulsion maintains momentum through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and artistic journey feels inevitable, with specific details like the quartz colonnade. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though it echoes familiar literary tropes.</comment>
