<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority lacks concrete contradiction under pressure; emotions are somewhat abstract (e.g., "pulsing with forgotten histories"). The final determination feels earned, but embodied struggle is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise (determination to continue, shard spent) under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in dim shard and receded dreams. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (e.g., dust motes, green glass), with the repair bay and shard constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (discovering truth) is signaled early; escalation under Accumulative lens through repeated journeys deepens knowledge. Agency in redirecting flows and cost in spent shard are clear, but pressure lacks sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and truth emerges through journeys and fragmented dreams; ending offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Subtext in whispers, but some abstraction limits emotional punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (sensory, map-maker focused). Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and elision (e.g., spontaneous jumps) is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with good rhythm and density; minor overwriting (e.g., "pulsing with forgotten histories") but no major artifacts or loops. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept of weaving between worlds is fresh and integrated with character quest; specific details (green glass, repair bay) avoid tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
