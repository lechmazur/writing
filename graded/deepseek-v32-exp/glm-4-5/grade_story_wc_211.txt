<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper pressures Elias's isolation and the prophecy's weight.

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold.
