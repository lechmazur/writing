<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses—ambition versus letting go—are concretely embodied through her acute smell and journalizing obsession. Her final choice to stop monitoring the seed is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her relinquishing control. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Maren shifts from compulsive journalizing to acceptance, foreclosing that path. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the insight. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her ambition shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-bearing: the treetop village constrains her herbalist work, and the corpse flower seed charges the final image. Sensory detail—especially olfactory—is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's expertise. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating serenity through control versus surrender) escalates via Maren's agency under the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when she reinterprets the corpse flower's stench, leading to a choice with cost: abandoning her journalizing. Conflict is internal but viscerally felt through concrete actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars: the corpse flower's rot as invitation mirrors Maren's need to stop resisting. Subtext operates through doodling, smell, and the elder's wisdom. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature anchored in olfaction. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining consistency under pressure. No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect Maren's herbalist mindset and sensory acuity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, and the final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis: treetop village, olfactory sensitivity, and corpse flower seed transform familiar themes of ambition and surrender. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
