<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia and search for silence are concretely embodied through micro-choices like pressing the doll and risking the inversion; her final "sprouted" change is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her internal stretch and father's reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; orientation anchors early; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the gilded hush humming in her bones and the strained reunion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details ("concrete wombs," "xenial trellis") filter through Maren's POV; the trellis as micro-setting constrains choice and decisively charges the final image of release and growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding peace) escalates through Maren's agency during the inversion; cost is unmistakable in her transformed silence and the father's relief-anger, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of growth through silence emerges organically from particulars like the doll and trellis; subtext operates in implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "I sprouted."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("silences tasted like iron"); voice is poetic and consistent; rhythmic control under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful ("gilded hush"); sentence-level propulsion varies naturally; no artifacts muddle clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise of collecting silences and gravity inversions; specific synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
