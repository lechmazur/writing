<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Queen's interiority is concrete and contradictory (disenchanted yet authoritative). Final choice to remove crown and climb is earned by dream causality with visible cost. The girl is a functional mirror but lightly sketched; no diagnostic label-speak in peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise (removing crown, deciding to climb higher) with cost legible in the crown's abandonment. The girl's arrival is a minor coincidence but doesn't resolve the core tension; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight) filtered through POV. The grotto and starlight constrain choice and charge the final image. Slight risk of ornamental density, but spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams vs. duty) escalates via the climb and vision under accumulative lens. Queen's agency in removing the crown narrows options with a visible price (renouncing her rule). No antagonist required; pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and destined purpose emerges through concrete images (crown, starlight, climb) without moralizing. The final reconfiguration (queen as ruler of the threshold) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct poetic-perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure; dialogue is minimal but functional. No head-hopping. The lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, high-density prose with strong rhythmic control. Some figurative language ("lace that could cut") borders on strain but doesn't obscure causality or closure. Minor overwriting risk in peaks; no loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of monarchy and dream logic. Tropes transformed through specific voice and grounded imagery. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
