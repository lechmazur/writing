<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara and Harold are vividly drawn; Harold's change is earned through music, with visible cost, though Elara's interiority is somewhat static and instrumental to the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear and tight; closure lands with potent Conceptual Repricing (record pieces pressed together) and legible cost; orientation immediate, hybrid-causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (altitude, light) creates a resonant atmosphere; the broken record object charges the final image, fulfilling the micro-setting requirement for high-band scoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (flawless goodbye) escalate with blood-work results; agency (Elara's music, Harold's call) drives to reconciliation with felt cost of time lost and impending death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the mundane and the nature of a good goodbye emerges through concrete particulars; ending redefines "flawless goodbye" without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV (Elara) with lyrical, precise prose; dialogue natural and economical; voice distinct and controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; sentences advance character and atmosphere with high clarity and propulsion; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar hospice-reconciliation premise made fresh by specific details (hymning the mundane, broken record) and a transformed concept of goodbye; synthesis feels inevitable and organic.</comment>
