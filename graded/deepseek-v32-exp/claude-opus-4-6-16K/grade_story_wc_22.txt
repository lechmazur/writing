<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in a vividly rendered past, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. However, contradictory impulses are not simultaneously active in scene; the internal conflict resides in backstory rather than present pressure, which slightly limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the garden as correspondence to a battlefield. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the dead reef shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The jetty functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (birds guide planting) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated through the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through a deepening of the stake—from personal gardening to a "submerged concord" with the past. The cost of daily, faithful labor is legible, though the pressure remains quiet and internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer: the garden as an act of correspondence, not compensation. No moralizing; subtext is rich and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with stable third-person POV filtered through Maren's perception. The prose rhythm modulates with the reflective tone, and any elision feels purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: sentences are dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and no artifacts. Figurative language is precise and coherent, and the final image lands with uncluttered force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead languages, ecological grief, and quiet reclamation feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices transform a quiet premise into a singular artistic stance without gimmickry.</comment>
