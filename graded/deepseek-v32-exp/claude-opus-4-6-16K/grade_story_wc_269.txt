<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interior contradiction—tapping for calm versus urgent discovery—is embodied in scene; her final choice to document is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the silence and realization. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise (typing the report) that reconfigures meaning with cost legible in "the silence felt enormous." Orientation is clear within 120 words; revelation arises from patterned data assembly, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting—console, atlas page, gray Atlantic—constrains choice and charges the final image (ghost islands through light). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting elements are woven into action and reweight closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) escalates via density increase under accumulative lens; protagonist's agency in assembling data leads to revelation, foreclosing passive witnessing with cost felt in the understanding of insufficient ban.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—tapping, atlas page, voids—without moralizing; ending offers a resonant non-literal answer through the image of ghost islands and typing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (scientific, rhythmic); prose syntax mirrors Lena's thought process; no head-hopping; purposeful compression (tapping rhythm) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and coherent ("color drain from them like blood leaving a face"); sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate change focus on delayed subsidence from extraction voids; specific details (tapping, atlas page) transform tropes; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
