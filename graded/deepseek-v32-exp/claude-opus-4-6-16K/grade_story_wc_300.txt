<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marguerite’s characterization is concrete and evolves under pressure; her interior contradiction (professional distance vs. empathetic pull) is embodied in micro-choices like balancing the pearl. The final choice to seek the families is earned by the causal chain of discoveries and her confessed realization. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is shown through tactile perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marguerite actively redefines “shelter.” Orientation is immediate; pattern of discovery and confession builds density that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in her vulnerable gesture of knocking on the motel door. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves are a micro-setting that actively transforms light and perception, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marguerite’s professional eye. The shell and pearl function as object-as-setting, their properties (glow, inscribed confessions) directly shape her stance and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying survival vs. seeking honest connection) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a deepening through layered revelation (crack → crystal → shell → pearl → confessions). Marguerite’s agency drives the final turn; cost is felt in her relinquishment of professional distance and the risk of offering the pearl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (shelter as emotional honesty vs. physical hiding) emerges organically from particulars (condemnation report, confessions, pearl). Subtext operates in image and gesture (pearl crowning her head). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the charged poise of the motel encounter. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature (inspector’s eye for detail). Voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity; lyrical passages (“light itself had learned patience”) are voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Diction remains within the POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propelled; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor artifact: “latent radiance” and “resonant hush” verge on ornamental but are integrated into the conceit. No loops or scaffold; clarity is maintained. Figurative language is coherent and supports closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise (bunker inspector finds confessional cave) offers a fresh, specific angle. Tropes (hidden cave, magical object) are transformed through grounded emotional logic and character choice. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric intensity, symbolic pearl) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
