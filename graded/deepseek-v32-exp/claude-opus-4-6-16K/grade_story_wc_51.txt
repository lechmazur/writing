<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete traits; her internal conflict between measuring burdens and being trapped is embodied in her actions. The Earned Stasis closure is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her endless repetition. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her precise calibration versus her boundlessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost in the final lines: "the pattern could never be complete." The persistent constraint of recursive grief shapes tactics and the final image, making the ending inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the grotto traps her without walls, and starlight, bronze veins, and lamp burner charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the weaver's perception, reinforcing the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the weaver's agency in measuring each burden, deepening the pattern and her entrapment. Cost is unmistakable in her boundary-less trap. One meaningful tightening—the repetition—reweights the stake with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recursive pattern of grief, with subtext in imagery like "fractal bloom" and "shingled hush." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "That was the nature of fractals. That was the nature of grief."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "boundary-lessly trapped") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "shingled hush." Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of fractals and grief measurement, transformed through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
