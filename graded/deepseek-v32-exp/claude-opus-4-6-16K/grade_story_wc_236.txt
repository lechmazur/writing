<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in the loss of smell; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "felt something shift in her chest"); the final realization that attention is a sense is earned through her repair action and reflection, with visible cost in her adaptation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost ("you are still here. You can still perceive what matters"); accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is anchored by ~120 words; the screw's repurposing shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (shop, fog) and objects (birthing clamp screw, clepsydra) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in finding meaning after loss escalate through the repair process and reflection; agency is in Lena's attention and action, driving accumulation under the lens; cost is legible in her realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges through specifics like the screw's repurposing; subtext operates in gesture and image; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong in filtering details through Lena's expertise; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no artifacts, loops, or scaffold; figurative language is controlled; sentences advance character and atmosphere with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loss, repair, and perception; specific details like the birthing clamp screw create organic originality; risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
