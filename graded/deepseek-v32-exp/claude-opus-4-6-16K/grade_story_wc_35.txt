<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her interiority is concrete (e.g., tasting memories, hands in salt). The final choice to share her grief is earned by her study of the pavilion, with visible cost (the memory is sanded but not gone). No stock phrasing; emotions are embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with conceptual repricing of grief. The accumulative lens holds, and cost is legible in the final image of the weeping fortress. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The pavilion’s constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (weeping fortress, coral icebound pavilion) and constrains choice (accessible only after rain). The environment charges the final image and shapes Maren’s method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren’s internal grief. Escalation is her decision to submerge in collective remorse, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in her unsteady emergence and new resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about grief being carried, not cured. No moralizing; subtext is rich in the salt, pavilion, and tidal pools.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Maren’s perception. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm are controlled and heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The rhythm supports emotional beats, and the final line resonates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, combining memory-tasting, a desert fortress, and a remorse-storing pavilion. The synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking (magical realism) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
