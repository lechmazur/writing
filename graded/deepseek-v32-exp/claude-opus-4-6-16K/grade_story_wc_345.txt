<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sable's micro-choices (kneeling to touch the warm chalk, climbing the ridge) reveal a hierarchy of values moving from puzzlement to trust, and her action to place the fruit as an offering demonstrates earned emotional progression. The Gardener's motivation ("to orchestrate collective effort") is clear and consistent, though its interiority is intentionally oblique. The settlers function credibly as a collective secondary character applying communal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through patterned messages and collective responses to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure: "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN." Cost is legible on-page in the community's labor and the ghost's subsequent absence. The mosaic of shards (dawn messages, ridge climb, orchard renewal) is taught early and coheres under the lens, landing with undeniable reconfiguration of agency and hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating arches and mineral rain are not just vivid backdrop but constrain and enable the pivotal action of harvesting water. The butterfly garden watering bell evolves from a personal relic to a communal signal, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (chalk warmth, "fat, ringing drops," soil sifted through fingers), fully integrated with the POV's urgent, wonder-tinted perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (communal survival) is signaled early and escalates through the Gardener's sequenced instructions, each requiring specific, on-page agency (climbing, striking rock, reexamining soil). The cost is the settlers' pooled effort and the relinquishment of a supernatural savior. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density of collective action, culminating in the earned fruition and the ghost's departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and symbol: hope is "brambled with memory," community is built through shared work, and salvation is internalized. The final line is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The watering bell and chalk motifs accrue meaning through repetition, transforming into vessels of subtext and continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and precise, with a distinct perceptual signature ("trailing a faint glow the color of nebula light"). POV is a stable, close third-person that embraces the collective "they" without head-hopping. The prose's rhythmic control supports the accumulative pattern, and any elision (the ghost's origin) is purposeful, serving the closure's thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and devoid of scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("ribs of some slumbering god," "sanctuary made visible") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively between expansive imagery and terse action. A single minor register note ("orchestrate collective effort" feels slightly analytic) prevents a 9+ score, but clarity and momentum are superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a spectral guide, chalk messages, and a dying orchard planet feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept transforms the familiar "ghost story" into a parable of community and indirect agency. Specific, irreplaceable details (the copper watering bell, mineral rain from arches) anchor the originality in tangible, choice-constraining reality. The risk of a quiet, collective protagonist pays off.</comment>
