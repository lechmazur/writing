<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Margit's reticence and observant nature are concretely embodied through her actions with stones and supplies; her final choice to add to the letter chain is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her silent endurance felt in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final sentence; stone-cairn pattern taught early pays off in the letter chain, making the structure inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (haunted lantern room forces relighting) and charges the final image; sensory details like "vast Atlantic breathing against the glass" are filtered through Margit's professional bias, elevating atmosphere to tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety escalates through accumulative density of the letter chain; Margit's agency in relighting the lamp and adding her page forecloses her silence with visible cost in the stacked stones and quiet burning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of carried light emerges through particulars like sea glass and stone cairns; subtext operates in gesture and silence; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Margit's observant, maritime lexicon shapes rhythm and selection; no head-hopping; lyrical compression supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("luminescent ache") is consistent and purpose-driven, accelerating momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse logistics and anonymous intimacy feels organic; stone-cairn messaging and sea glass transform familiar tropes through specific, charged detail; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
