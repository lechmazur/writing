<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation evolves from pretext to genuine pursuit, with interiority shown through specific perceptions. Cassia is distinct and their relationship forces choices. The final decision to learn Sumerian is earned and carries cost, though contradictory impulses are more sequential than simultaneous in a single scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the sugar cup image reweighting the initial lie. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, cost is legible in the final paragraph, and the building's renovation as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Maren's professional eye; the building and rooftop garden constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details (herbs, meteor light) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the building before renovation) escalates through Maren's agency from documentation to learning Sumerian. Cost is unmistakable in the developers' arrival and the preserved rituals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "agreed upon lies" emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement. The ending’s sugar cup offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the initial deception without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Maren’s perceptual signature as a conservator is distinct. Dialogue carries subtext and character voice, especially Cassia’s. Prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“a sound like a door opening in an old house”) is precise. Final sentence achieves high resonance without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architectural conservation and dead language study feels inevitable. The concept of “agreed upon lies” is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
