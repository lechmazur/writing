<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory—caution versus longing—embodied in micro-choices like drawing the vial unconsciously. The final choice to grieve is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her weeping, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the weeping and realization; the accumulative lens holds, and the dying flower's constraint shapes the final image. Orientation is anchored early, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the UV wing reveals hidden geometry, and the greenhouse's extinct flora pressures Elara's confrontation with grief. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding grief) escalate via accumulative density—dying bloom, UV light, vial—culminating in Elara's agency to uncap the vial. Cost is legible in her unraveling and the conceptual price of finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through image and action: scent as memory-bypass, grief as acceptance. The ending's "It was enough" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, sensory-filtered through Elara's wistfulness. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, and any elision (e.g., vial drawn "without deciding") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("secret violet geometry") is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, supporting closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of extinct flora, UV revelation, and scent memory feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
