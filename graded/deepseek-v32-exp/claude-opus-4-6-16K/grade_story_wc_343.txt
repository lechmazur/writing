<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sable's curiosity is consistent and drives her investigation; micro-choices like deciphering the hopscotch board reveal her values. However, interior contradiction is absent, and the final choice, while earned, lacks a strongly felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with logical linkages from clues to action. Closure is a decisive change (untethering and pursuit), but the emotional cost is implied rather than visceral, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "light pooled like spilled ink") and the airship as micro-setting constrain choices and charge the final image. Capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though integration is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering stranded luminance) escalates through Sable's agency in decoding clues; cost is legible in the risk of the unknown but somewhat understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity and sociable isolation emerges through particulars like the phrasebook and starlings; ending offers resonant non-literal answer. Capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's attention to patterns); voice is lyrical and controlled. Capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with vivid imagery, no scaffold or loops; figurative language supports pressure without muddle. Capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking, cryptic clues, and natural phenomena feels organic; specific details elevate familiarity. Capped due to Q2 gate.</comment>
