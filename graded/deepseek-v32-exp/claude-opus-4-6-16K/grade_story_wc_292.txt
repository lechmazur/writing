<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's idealistic drive and embodied nervous confidence compel her risky choice; the final relief is earned by three years of research, with cost felt in the trembling hands and hammering pulse. No diagnostic labels; interior contradiction is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Maren's evidence directly triggers Halvorsen's reversal. Closure is a decisive change with legible cost in the copper nail's warmth and "something had been corrected." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt-streaked station and ozone taste create palpable dread, but the copper nail—a micro-setting object—constrains choice and charges the final image with its patina and warmth, making setting indispensable to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing the exile) escalates through Maren's agency in presenting the journals; the cost is visible in her wringing dread and the director's careful examination. One meaningful tightening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cartographic justice emerges through Britta's sacrifice and Maren's quest; the ending's "maps, at last, made honest" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Maren's map-librarian perception; voice is distinct with rhythmic control ("spongey dread," "copper nail was warm"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("building itself were sweating with dread") serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate shift, historical injustice, and coded journals feels organic and inevitable; the premise is transformed through specific detail like the copper nail and reversible exile clause.</comment>
