<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren's grief is embodied through specific, contradictory impulses (fear of the dream, compulsive folding). Her final choice to draw instead of fold is earned by the dream's revelation, with cost visible in her shaking and weeping. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, building through imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost ("Maren wept... luminous torment"). Orientation is immediate and vivid; the taught pattern of folding/unfolding pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and filters through Maren's perception. The glass basilica and floating island are not just backdrop—they constrain action (lantern materials) and charge the final image (basilica becoming crane). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting final grief) escalates through Maren's agency in playing the twentieth lantern. Under the accumulative lens, the dream sequence is a decisive deepening that reweights all prior material. Cost is legible in her physical and emotional unraveling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed into art emerges organically from the folding/unfolding motif and the dream revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of drawing, reweighting prior images without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the dream's double movement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that matches Maren's craft. Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains coherent; purposeful compression (e.g., "the shadow detaches") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates through the dream sequence and decelerates at closure. Minor quibble: "luminous torment" is slightly abstract but contextually earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording, origami, and floating-island fantasy feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and transforms familiar grief narratives through specific, irreplaceable details.</comment>
