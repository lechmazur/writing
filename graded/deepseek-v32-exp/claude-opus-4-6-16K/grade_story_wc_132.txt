<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction between control and surrender is embodied in concrete micro-choices (holding the leaf, letting seedlings grow) that culminate in an earned renunciation of her former identity. The cost of releasing her lifelong governance is felt in the line "She did not want to become someone new." No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and held: blight forces observation of the thriving linden, which motivates a decisive change in method. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost in the final image of being "changed by what she could not command." Mosaic structure across time is taught early and transitions are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and volunteer linden are not just vivid sensory details but active constraints that pressure Maren's choice to relinquish control, directly charging the final image. Setting is filtered through her professional bias and evolves with the narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the nursery via adaptation) tightens meaningfully through Maren's agency: her observation of the linden forces a stance crystallization. The cost of abandoning her identity as controller is legible on the page and escalates under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of control vs. natural resilience emerges through specific, recurring images (linden leaf, moss, goldfinches) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the garden that "grew into something neither she nor any catalog had ever imagined."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific, observant, circuitously sincere—that remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; the lyric compression of time is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a general repositioning troops") is character-apt and controlled. Sentence rhythm varies naturally to accelerate and breathe with the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical intelligence and human surrender feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (linden leaf, moss stitching decay) and a non-obvious moral calculus that avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
