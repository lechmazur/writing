<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concretely embodied through the donor heart's rhythm and her dye master's perception; her motivation to understand "magnetized stories" intensifies under pressure, and the final choice to write a letter is earned by the morpho wing epiphany with visible cost—no slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern of light and reflection builds to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Sable reinterprets the heart as "entrusted light"; cost legible in "the mist rose... like a valley remembering its own breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (basalt slab, rotating light); the morpho wing and tea house function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image—"the blue did not simply appear—it erupted" directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her donor) escalates via Sable's agency under accumulative lens: waiting for light, tilting the wing triggers a deepening that reweights meaning with felt cost of longing and acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the structural color analogy without moralizing; subtext in the wing's "architecture and angle" mirrors the donor's life; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "entrusted light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—dye master's focus on color and light; lyrical syntax reflects her observant nature; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, every sentence advances story or atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; peak beats like "erupted, a silent explosion" maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes heart transplant and structural color with fresh angle; tropes transformed through specific detail (dye master, cartographer); turns feel inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
