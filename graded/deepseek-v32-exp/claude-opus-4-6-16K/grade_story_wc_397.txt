<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear, rooted in a transformative medical event, and intensifies credibly. Interiority is concrete and particular ("gripped reality loosely... like a bird"). The final renunciation of immediate death for patient waiting is earned by her accumulated listening. Minor abstraction in emotional description ("Colors seemed provisional") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she recognizes the sound, crystallizing her stance of readiness. Cost is legible in her turning back to work, foreclosing the path of scheduled death. The stroke-to-journey causality is strong, though the disaster relief vector is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Arctic setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice (testing ice with the parasol). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("low, resonant hum, like wind through the rigging"). The environment charges the final image and is indispensable to the protagonist's quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through her repeated, focused listening. The dominant stake (seeking understanding vs. seeking death) deepens meaningfully. The climax is a choice (to wait) driven by her agency, with visible cost in her resumed labor. A single, powerful intensification is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and recurring images (parasol, sound, folding patience). Subtext is rich in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to approach an ending, reweighting the story's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, is perfectly stable. The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Diction and syntax consistently reflect the protagonist's refined, contemplative consciousness. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies effectively with the beats. No loops, scaffold, or artifice that obscures clarity. High information density without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism, a stroke's perceptual shift, and an Arctic sound-quest is fresh and specific. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks (lyrical focus, quiet climax) heighten stakes without becoming gimmicky, fully committed to its vision.</comment>
