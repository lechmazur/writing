<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene; her final transformation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost ("not painless, not gentle"); causal lens holds; orientation is clear early; the fortune and spices shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforging the bond) escalates through Maren's agency; the cost of metamorphosis is legible on the page, narrowing options to a single path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material via the resonant image of two phoenixes, answering the central question of love beyond death.</comment>
