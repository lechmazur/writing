<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (destructive arson vs. fidelity) are dramatized in scene; her final choice to preserve through decay is earned by the letter's revelation and her prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of crumbling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (Maren's new mission) with felt cost (acceptance of decay) and the persistent constraint of the archive's fragility shapes the final image; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choice (navigation, discovery) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's expertise, with the environment actively mirroring theme (volcanic rock, crumbling plaster).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens—finding the letter forces a reconfiguration of stakes; cost is unmistakable on the page in the final paragraph's acceptance of decay as the price of authenticity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of authentic preservation versus sanitized replication emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The crumbling was the point") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and perceptually distinct, with a lyrical, precise texture; rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak beats (e.g., "something molten and immense") and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is integrated and purposeful; sentence-level rhythm supports emotional beats and closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archive quest, artistic trail, and arsonist protagonist feels inevitable; risk-taking in theme (embracing decay) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; specific, grounded details resist template plots.</comment>
