<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's reluctant duty is clear through concrete micro-choices; her endurance at closure is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the final turn back to the trees. Contradictory impulses act in scene (hates the place but stays to help). No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is Earned Stasis with felt cost on-page ("turned back to her terrible, necessary trees"). Orientation is anchored early; frost constraint shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (labyrinth traps, frost forces hurry) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and vivid ("gnarled rows of trees that grew sideways from the cliff face"). Mechanical birds and stone fruit are integral to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under time pressure; the frost clock tightens options. Cost is legible when she fails to complete all resonance points and must shout directions herself, reinforcing her burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of necessary sacrifice emerges from events, not statement; the final image of "terrible, necessary trees" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Maren's silent actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet grim, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; diction remains within Maren's lexicon. Elision (e.g., blueprint details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is precise ("arthritic fingers"). Sentence propulsion accelerates with frost urgency. Closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, acoustic labyrinth, and mechanical birds; specificity grounds emotional truth. Risk-taking in setting heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through lived detail.</comment>
