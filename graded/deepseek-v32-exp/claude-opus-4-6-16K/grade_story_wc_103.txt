<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and internal conflict are concretely embodied (e.g., "quaking reverie...equal parts grief and wonder"), and her final navigation of time is earned by her prior agency with the fragment and geometry. The closure choice is rooted in her specific expertise and flaw (being "retrocognitively trapped").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: fragment discovery → retrocognitive trap → motivation to understand → application of hyperbolic geometry → Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is immediate, closure lands with cost (photograph's disintegration and her acceptance), and the persistent constraint of the fragment shapes the entire arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not just backdrop but a micro-setting that constrains choice (she trains the roots) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's expertise ("texture of bark and time"). The environment evolves with her actions, mirroring the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding/escaping temporal trap) escalates through protagonist agency: the fading photographs raise cost, her redesign of the garden is a tactical choice that narrows options, and the final navigation is a decisive act with felt cost (loss of the last photograph). Coherent pressure under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's nonlinear texture emerges organically from particulars (fragment, bridges, geometry, fading photos). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("fibrous and branching, like root-wood") without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the final image of roots growing and the garden holding its breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, precise, informed by her designer's mind). Voice modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., "time split open like a fig") is taught and legible, enhancing the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; figurative language is consistent and supports clarity ("time split open like a fig"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and pausing with the beat. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph achieves high information density with resonant propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and a living setting feels organic and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded character choices (maze designer applying her craft). Risk-taking in lyrical, concept-driven narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure is fully committed.</comment>
