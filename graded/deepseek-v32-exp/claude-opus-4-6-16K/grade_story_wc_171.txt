<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (tremor in hand, worn groove on clipboard). Sera's contradictory impulses—yearning for peace yet accepting flawed compromise—play out in scene. Final choice to endorse the imperfect accord is earned by her exhaustion and the conjunction's pressure, with visible cost in the displaced civilians and amnestied commanders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because of the rare conjunction and accumulated exhaustion, Sera leverages ritual to broker a flawed peace. Closure is a decisive change (the signing) with on-page cost (injustices, displacement). Orientation is immediate; the terrace, war, and Sera's role are anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and the ebony clipboard function as micro-settings that constrain choice (the terrace's history and acoustics, the clipboard's tallies). The final image of the terrace glowing "cracked and enduring" is charged by these specifics. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Sera's professional fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending the war) tightens under the celestial deadline. Escalation is driven by Sera's agency—her gentle questioning, shared grief, and strategic use of vulnerability—culminating in the signed accord. The cost is unmistakable: amnesty for war criminals, displacement of thousands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the flawed treaty and the clipboard's scars, culminating in the resonant final image: "the most beautiful ugly thing." No moralizing; the price of redemption is embodied in the concrete compromises. Subtext operates in gestures (weeping together, the trembling hand).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a weary, precise perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure (short, declarative sentences during negotiation). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; Sera's consciousness filters all.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("peace was not a feeling but a structure") is purposeful and clear. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, accelerating through argument and slowing at closure. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eternal war, celestial omen, and gritty diplomatic compromise feels inevitable. The focus on "adequacy over heroism" transforms the peacemaker trope. Specific, lived-in details (tally marks, worn clipboard) ground the concept. Risk-taking in the quiet, somber ending heightens stakes.</comment>
