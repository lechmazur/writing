<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's motivation to evolve tradition is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her to unseal the embryo. Interiority is concrete via embodied emotion (e.g., scarred knees, breath stopping) and micro-choices like digging and decoding. The final choice is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost as she anticipates the committee's response. Contradictory impulses between her beliefs and the committee's ways act throughout, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when. Causal linkages (plant telepathy → distress → discovery → decoding → unsealing) tighten options coherently. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible on-page: "The reconstruction crews would arrive tomorrow and find their standardized springs transformed." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of standardization shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (oxidized copper water, thermophilic moss) and filtered through Sable's POV. The hot springs function as micro-setting, constraining choice by being the site of discovery and unsealing, and charging the final image of golden water. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition vs. standardized recovery) is signaled early and escalates through Sable's agency: she discovers the embryo, decodes the script, and unseals it. The tightening forces a trade-off with cost visible as the transformed springs will confront the committee. Under the causal lens, escalation is driven by protagonist choice, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the embryo as potential and the moss composing hymns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the golden water and Sable's stance, though her direct thought "tradition is not a museum exhibit" leans slightly toward statement. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., plant whispers, amber warmth) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, attentive to plants and tradition. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "the moss sang" under pressure). No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., kite backstory) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("water the color of oxidized copper") is precise and consistent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; peak beats remain clear. The final image is charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and destiny seeds into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices (e.g., decoding via kite tail). Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid template plots.</comment>
