<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her motivation to break her seven-year silence is earned by her understanding of Elin's encoded plight. The final choice to sing and encode messages is a credible endurance with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elin's hollowing and Maren's silence. The accumulative lens holds tightly; the storm inciting incident and subsequent deciphering chain are causally linked and lead to the final image of mutual audience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the isolated courtyard becomes the canvas for communication, and the flower press bolt plate constrains deciphering and charges the closure. Sensory details (mist, glowing pigments) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unspoken connection escalates through Maren's agency—deciphering, singing, encoding replies—under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the hollowing of Elin and Maren's seven-year silence, tightening the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as communication for unspoken needs emerges organically from encoded graffiti and song. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of "a balladeer and a ghost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable third-person limited POV filtered through Maren's professional and artistic perception. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports the accumulative texture and wonder tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and elegant, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like something curious and alive") is purposeful and clear; information density is high without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story, encoded art, and isolated setting feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the core concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
