<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and poet‑specific; her final choice to “keep the braid” is earned by prior reflection on the rope and the prisoner’s choice, with visible cost (renouncing omniscience). No diagnostic label‑speak; emotion is embodied in tactile detail. The only minor hairline slip is a slight abstraction in “ethically playful,” but it remains character‑bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Maren’s refusal of omniscience forecloses a path while affirming the “braid” of linear time. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; orientation is anchored early. The rope as persistent constraint shapes the final image, and cost is legible in the final sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (terra‑cotta grotto, rearranged stars) and charges the final image; the rope functions as a micro‑setting that constrains choice. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren’s poet’s eye. No generic placeholder; the grotto and rope are indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (omniscience vs. linear memory) is signaled early and escalates through Maren’s tactile examination of the rope and reflection on the prisoner’s choice. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases until her decision, which carries the cost of relinquishing cosmic knowledge. Agency is clear and cost is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rope, the beings’ offer, and Maren’s choice; the ending provides a resonant, non‑literal answer (“I’ll keep the braid”) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication; no thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third‑person limited with a distinct poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with lyrical precision under pressure; the single line of dialogue is natural. No head‑hopping; elision (the beings’ arrival) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“universe were learning to stutter”) is consistent and purposeful. No register drift; syntax reflects Maren’s contemplative state. Minor overwriting risk is fully controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise (energy beings’ choice) is transformed through Maren’s specific, grounded perspective as a poet and the rope’s tangible symbolism. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk‑taking in quiet, reflective climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative or template feel.</comment>
