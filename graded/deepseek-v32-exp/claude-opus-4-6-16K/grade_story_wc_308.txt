<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and her stillness is a consistent, embodied micro-choice that reveals character under pressure, culminating in an Earned Stasis (understanding, not capture). However, interiority remains somewhat abstract and observational; her emotional stakes are conceptual rather than viscerally contradictory, which limits the felt cost of her endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: "Some things were not meant to be caught, only understood." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from the first paragraph, building through patterned observation to a final image that reconfigures the premise. Orientation is immediate and the pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is the story's engine. The bone towers and canyon are not just backdrop but acoustic instruments that directly constrain the protagonist's method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through her navigator's POV, with the arrowhead and birds functioning as essential micro-settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (finding the pulse) are signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through the deepening pattern of striking/watching and the protagonist's increasing stillness, which narrows her options to pure waiting. The cost is the weeks of endured stasis, legible in the dust settling on her and the swifts landing on her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (understanding vs. possession, navigation through attentive stillness) emerges entirely through concrete action and image, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final line. The pulse concept and the bone towers are integrated particulars that avoid allegory. Subtext is rich in the contrast between moving and not-moving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the Accumulative/Textural lens—lyrical, precise, and patient. POV is stable and deeply focalized through the skimmer's perceptual signature (noticing sonic and avian patterns). The prose's rhythmic control under pressure ("Struck and watched. The dust settled on her shoulders.") is exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are dense, rhythmic, and propel the accumulative pattern without scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("a compass rose drawn in feathers and flight") is precise and integrated. There is no ornamental description; every image advances atmosphere, character, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic navigation, bone-tower architecture, and avian cartography is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a commitment to its implications. The choice of a quiet, understanding-based climax over a capture is a bold risk that heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
