<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elena's self-censorship and grief are concretely embodied; her final decision to write unredacted is earned by the photograph and timer ritual, with cost felt in her sob and the storm's resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds to a resonant reconfiguration; timer and envelope set up early pay off in closure that lands with emotional cost, reconfiguring Elena's stance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory and storm charge the final image and pressure Elena's vigil; sensory details (violet light, churning clouds) reflect internal state and constrain choice through isolation and altitude.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of self-expression versus safety escalate through timer countdown and storm, culminating in a choice to write that costs her protective silence; agency clear under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of seeing and not looking away emerges through photograph and writing; subtext in father's message and timer duration offers a non‑literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV with a poetic, reflective voice consistent throughout; perceptual signature distinct, elision (envelope contents) taught and paid off, no head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful and clear, rhythm supports emotional beats; no artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet, photographer, and observatory; vigil concept and timer ritual feel inevitable, with lyrical risk‑taking heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
