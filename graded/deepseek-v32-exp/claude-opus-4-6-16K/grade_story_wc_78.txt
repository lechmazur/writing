<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is vivid and motivated, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, lacking internal contradictory impulses prevents a 9+ score, though her final choice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot is tightly causal with clear orientation and closure. The standing wave confrontation is a decisive change driven by Maren's agency, with cost visible in her trembling mallet and hard breathing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature. The lyrical voice modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
