<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Morrow's interiority is concrete and contradictory—he seeks to capture ephemeral sounds despite knowing he will forget. His micro-choices (chalk, driftwood) align with his longing, and the final endurance (holding the sound) is earned by prior causality with visible cost of loneliness and aging. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion embodied in tactile details like stiff hands and chalk circles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise—Morrow holds the sound as the fog dissolves, circle remains—with felt cost of transience. Orientation clear within 120 words; structure is a single scene with embedded reflection that tilts present stance. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (precognitive forgetfulness) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog sculpture garden is not merely backdrop—it constrains choice (sculptures dictate marking) and charges the final image (doorway, circle). Sensory detail selective and filtered through Morrow's perception; micro-setting (chalk, driftwood) functions as tool-as-setting that alters tactics. No generic placeholder; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the sound of aging) escalates via density increase under accumulative lens—layered motifs of videotapes, daughter, stiffness. Agency drives escalation through driftwood arrangement and chalk marking; cost is legible in the final image (sound held but will pass, circle as fragile trace). No coincidence or off-stage resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transience and memory emerges organically through concrete images (fog sculptures, chalk circles, driftwood arrows). Ending offers resonant non-literal answer: the remaining circle reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no thematic echo or prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—Morrow's poetic, melancholic voice filters perception (fog shapes as premonitions, sound as "tidal"). Rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful compression (videotape reflection) taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sound of something that had once been loud learning to be quiet") is coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or register drift; closure image crisp and unburdened by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fog sculpture garden, precognitive forgetfulness, and acoustic longing feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise or template plots; transformation through grounded, lived detail.</comment>
