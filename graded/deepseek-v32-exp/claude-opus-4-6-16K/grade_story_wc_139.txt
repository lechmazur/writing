<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and driven by a desire for fairness, with embodied emotion ("the old sickness rise in her throat"). Her active waiting and confrontation reveal a hierarchy of values, and Desmond's shift to "calculating a fair price" is earned by prior causality and the ink pot's symbolic weight. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws complicate choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mara's discovery leads to planned confrontation, forcing Desmond's agreement. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Desmond's exposure risk and Mara's exhale; the ink pot persistently constrains choice. Orientation is anchored early; no outline sequencing or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (funeral home prep room) and object (ink pot) charge the final image with "deathly vitality," mirroring themes of honesty and presentation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV; the ink pot constrains choice and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair trade) escalates under causal lens via Mara's agency: from active waiting to threat of FBI exposure. Cost is legible in Desmond's calculation and risk; one meaningful tightening forecloses his grift path. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink pot as honest object, funeral home setting, and the "mathematics of a fair trade." Subtext operates in gesture and implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the math... would balance") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity ("the recognition that her father's brilliance was a disease"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density ("waiting actively, the way a chess player waits"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion supports pressure. Clean grammar and purposeful syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con artist trope through daughter's perspective, with specific details (ink pot, funeral home) that feel organic. Risk-taking in moral calculus heightens stakes; closure reconfigures prior material without gimmickry.</comment>
