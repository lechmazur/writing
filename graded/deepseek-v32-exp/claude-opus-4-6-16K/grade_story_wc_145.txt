<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her atlas-editor precision filtering her perception; her final walk onto the ice is earned by the accumulation of condensation patterns and phrasebook insight, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing as Maren realizes rivers begin in the pattern itself, with cost legible in her committed walk onto the blank ice; orientation is anchored early and the pattern-teaching pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vivid, selective, and pressure choices; the condensation patterns function as micro-setting that constrains Maren’s understanding and directly charges the final image with the coordinate revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes tighten through pattern density—condensation shift, phrasebook, falcon’s empty return—culminating in Maren’s agency to walk out; cost is visible in her foreclosing other paths to embrace the pattern’s logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory/source convergence, blankness as erasure/beginnings; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the quest through the final image of walking onto the ice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Maren’s cartographic precision filters observation; voice is controlled, rhythmic, and devoid of head-hopping, supporting the accumulative pattern without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("a page no one had written on," "feathered stone") is consistent and clear, and sentence-level rhythm varies naturally to support atmosphere and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of cartographic quest and metaphysical pattern; details like condensation watersheds and phrasebook etymology are specific and irreversible, with risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure that heightens stakes.</comment>
