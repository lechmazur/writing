<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving her investigation with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices under pressure, like touching Kai's patch and methodically placing sensors, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final charged poise—walking out with data—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing passive mourning with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flattens the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: her survey actions lead directly to the discovery of a dangerous wind corridor. Closure is a charged poise—she will map the unseen—with cost legible in her touch of the patch and the "heavier, more luminous" data. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (port, container labyrinth, eleven nights). No plot amnesia or convenience; the persistent constraint of the labyrinth shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the container labyrinth functions as a wind instrument, directly shaping Maren's sensor placements and the climax. Sensory details (salt and diesel, sodium light) are filtered through her professional bias. The environment charges the final image—the labyrinth will "speak"—and micro-setting objects like the anemometers are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent another accident via foresight) escalates through her agency: discovering a wind corridor that mirrors her brother's death tightens options and deepens knowledge. Cost is felt in her embodied realization and the weight of her data. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres from survey to closure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—grief transformed into systematic foresight—emerges through particulars like the patch and wind patterns, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images (the labyrinth as score, the patch as legacy). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she will make the invisible visible, reweighting prior material through conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: professional precision blended with lyrical texture ("pulled the sound from the air like a thread"). Voice modulates under pressure, maintaining rhythmic control. No head-hopping; all perception stays character-bound and inference reads as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("wind instrument," "hazy precision") is coherent and heightens clarity. Information density is high—every sentence advances story or atmosphere—and no register drift or template cadence dulls the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of accident investigation, wind science, and grief feels organic and inevitable, with specific details like container IDs and anemometer placements. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices; the quiet risk of a data-driven climax pays off. Fresh inflection comes from treating the labyrinth as an architectural wind map, though not radically innovative.</comment>
