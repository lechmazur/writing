<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her belief that truth is a debt to the dead. Interiority is concrete (e.g., weeping at decryption), and her final choice to witness is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses between duty and obsession are shown in scene, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (her commitment to witness). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. The diary's constraint shapes tactics, and closure lands on-page with a persistent price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (zeppelin, obsidian lagoon). The lagoon constrains choice (key to cipher) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Miriam's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through Miriam's agency (deciphering, visions). Cost is legible in her obsession and final commitment. Under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from events, but the final paragraph states it explicitly ("truth was not merely found..."), creating a thematic echo that deducts -0.7. Still, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, archival). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., visions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archival work, retrocognition, and historical recovery feels inevitable. Specific details (Adinkra glyph, obsidian lagoon) and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
