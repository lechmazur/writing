<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion and credible endurance. Her motivation—to reimagine the Vasari civilization—drives choices that culminate in the resonant act of transmission and reading, earning her final stance. The cost of isolation and forgotten revolution is felt, though internal conflict is summarized rather than shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise (reading the walls aloud) that reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost—her solitude and defiance. Orientation is clear early; the pattern of evidence and reflection tightens meaningfully toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the baroque asteroid and visible time constrain choices (covering mirrors, working through storms) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through Maren’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving her theory) escalates under the accumulative lens through her dedicated work and the monograph’s transmission. Agency drives the escalation; cost is legible in her isolation and the quiet defiance of the ending. No on-page antagonist, but opposition is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory, legacy, and defiance emerges through particulars—the parallel between Maren and the Vasari, the architecture as verse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: both defunct civilizations still speak. No moralizing; subtext is rich and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, textured voice that reflects Maren’s perception. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and lyrical density are taught and pay off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the final image is clear and resonant. No artifacts that obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: the concept of visible time and baroque asteroid civilization is fresh, fully integrated, and transformed through specific character and stakes. Risk-taking in poetic density and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
