<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's guilt is embodied through constellation tattoos and haunted firmware; her final choice to write the letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her trembling hand and steady constellations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure lands with firmware going silent and Maren writing back, reconfiguring meaning with cost legible in the softened dissonance and the memory of brightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds and amber object constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like jars of silence are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of guilt escalate through firmware's evolving messages and discovery of letters; Maren's agency in reading and responding drives escalation with unmistakable cost in the firmware's silent completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of trapped time and reconciliation emerges organically from amber, firmware, and letters; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, via the image of meteor hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping; prose rhythm and diction reflect Maren's mindset under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "spectral wails" is consistent and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of speculative haunted firmware and emotional guilt feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in combining lost sounds, letters, and amber heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
