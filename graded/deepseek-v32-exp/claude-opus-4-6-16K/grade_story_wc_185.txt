<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vael's motivation is clear, rooted in her role, and her actions align with her expertise. Interiority is concrete and embodied, but the final choice, while earned, lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the caves quieted, new ripple marks) and resonant reconfiguration (coexistence). The causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Cost is legible in the transformation of her life's work and the caves' new state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered and pressure choices; the ice and echo chamber stone function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Vael's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the caves) escalates through Vael's agency under the causal lens. The discovery of the ice and use of the stone represent a meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in the altered cave system and her shifted role as mapkeeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence and finding quiet emerges organically from events and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new ripple marks and the beings' reverence, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (noticing through vibration and pattern) and rhythmic control. Diction remains within Vael's plausible lexicon, and elision (e.g., the beings' nature) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("hammered repose") is integrated and enhances pressure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original and synthesized through specific, grounded details (ripple marks, ice cracks, echo chamber stone). The story commits fully to its concept, and the resolution feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
