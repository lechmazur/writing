<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory, balancing skepticism with devotion; her micro-choices (pressing the shell, choosing belief) reveal hierarchy of values; final archiving decision is earned by prior causality with cost in incomplete fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Maren accepts building from absence; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation clear within 120 words; cost legible in notebook fragments and resolved stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden and seashell half function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through Maren's POV, supporting atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in memory reconstruction escalates via Maren's agency with the shell; under Accumulative lens, density increases through night vigil; cost is felt in fragmented echoes and her resolve to build from absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of archival reconstruction emerges through concrete images (shell, notebook, garden) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "morning she made her own," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose reflects Maren's archival mindset; no head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats; sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of quarantined memory and resonance structures is fresh and transformative; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
