<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's stubborn persistence and Elsa's feisty support are clearly motivated and embodied, with micro-choices like using the ribbon revealing character under pressure. The final choice to teach is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction could be deeper for a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; causal lens holds tightly from breach to discovery to teaching. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with legible cost—the lost workshop traded for ancestral knowledge—and the persistent constraint of the Syndicate shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (platform, light, bag) while charging the final image of teaching. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (right to craft) escalates via Maren's agency: persistence leads to discovery of unencumbered knowledge, tightening options. Cost is visible in the forfeited workshop and the reclaimed heritage, culminating in the teaching beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of generational wisdom emerges through particulars (ribbon, bag, orchard) without moralizing. The "deciduous vow" paragraph risks explicitness but the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of teaching in honest light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maren, with a distinct perceptual signature (quartz-eye expertise) and rhythmic control. Dialogue between Maren and Elsa is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically and advance story. Figurative language ("apple trees never asked permission") is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of quartz-eye mending, cathedral orchard, and generational conflict feels fresh and organic. Specific details (colloidal silver, rose windows) anchor originality, though the core premise is a familiar defiance narrative elevated by setting and craft.</comment>
