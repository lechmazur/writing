<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final choice to write in her own hand is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the geological weight leaving her chest. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara leaves the key and walks away, with cost legible in "the weight that left her chest was geological." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored early. Persistent constraints (key, rose thorn) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "slow curtain of aurora" and "cold mineral air." The marble sanctuary and objects (rose thorn, key) constrain choices and charge the final image, micro-setting functioning as crucible for the protagonist's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (completing the letter vs. accepting incompletion) escalates accumulatively through density increase and cadence shift. Protagonist agency drives the tightening when she understands the key and writes her own line, with cost unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness and release emerges through particulars like the key and rose thorn, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of leaving doors behind, reweighting prior material with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a perceptual signature filtered through Elara's refined observation. POV is stable and consistent, and purposeful elision (key's meaning) pays off at closure. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, advancing story and atmosphere. No artifacts obscure closure; line-level craft is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of calligraphy forgery, symbolic objects, and internal conflict, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through grounded detail.</comment>
