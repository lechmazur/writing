<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as a noticer is consistent and drives her investigation; interiority is concrete and her final micro-choice (placing the orris root) reveals a hierarchy of values. However, the story lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which limits the emotional complexity. Her realization is earned and the cost is felt in the quiet ignition of the house, but the character arc is more observational than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear and held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the "hushed blaze" and the house's first breath. Orientation is immediate; the pattern of displacement is taught early and pays off at the ending with a conceptual repricing of unnoticed care. No causality breaks; the closure lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Maren's perception; sensory details (streetlights' half-hearted amber, spring smells) are purposeful and create atmosphere. The bay and houses function as micro-setting that charges the final image; the orris root shard as a recurring object reweights the closure. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why houses feel alive) is signaled early and escalates through Maren's accumulation of observations and the discovery of displaced objects. Agency is present in her investigation and final act of placement; cost is legible in the house's faint ignition. Under the accumulative lens, deepening changes knowledge and reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: sanctification through unconscious care, articulated via displaced objects without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the marble beginning its journey. Subtext operates in silence and implication; no thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and controlled; voice is distinct, lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature (noticing incremental changes). Syntax and rhythm modulate with contemplative pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression (e.g., "liminal moment") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; imagery is precise and voice-motivated. Closure image is clear; line-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive. No artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific: houses made alive by displaced objects, a non-obvious synthesis of creeping normality and unconscious sanctification. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the final image feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative template or ornamental novelty.</comment>
