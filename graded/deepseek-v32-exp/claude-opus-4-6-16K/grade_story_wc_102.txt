<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory (weeping for an unknown child, then seeking answers). Her motivation intensifies from grief to a spiritual quest, and the final healing is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the softening of ancient grief. The camera obscura artist's specific perception shapes her micro-choices and the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, building through image patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the grief "softens, to heal... by being finally understood." Orientation is immediate, and the past-life memory incites a coherent pilgrimage that culminates in the viaduct revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the grain silo, twilight viaduct, wisteria—filtered through Elara's perceptual bias. The tear and the viaduct act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, becoming indispensable to the revelation's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused love goes) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the softening of grief and the transformed love. One meaningful deepening at the viaduct reweights the stake with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—camera obscura, tear, breathing—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: love is "composted into the fabric of compassion," recharging prior images. Subtext operates in gesture, silence, and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (light, inversion, breath). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (past-life memory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and the final image is crisp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of camera obscura artistry, past-life memory, and Buddhist relic feels inevitable. The concept of "pilgrims of sparks" transforms familiar quest tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
