<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fen's interiority is concrete and contradictory (regret vs. attentiveness), with micro-choices like using the yarn needle and waiting for the ticking to stop. His final offer to the woman is earned by prior causality, showing a hierarchy of values with visible cost—the acceptance of retracing over restoration. The woman's layered presence serves as a crucible without overdevelopment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise as the crossing begins, reconfiguring meaning with cost legible in the "page turning" image. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The palimpsest constraint shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (fog-bound river crossing) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Fen's POV (e.g., rain gutters ticking, heron's call). Micro-settings like the yarn needle and planks are integrated into action, elevating atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Fen's internal conflict between regret and attentiveness) escalates through density increase under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear when Fen acts after the ticking stops, foreclosing passive waiting with cost in his engaged offer. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of palimpsest promises emerges through imagery and action, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the crossing image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, e.g., the woman's nod as "one more layer of ink."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, professional awareness shaped by years of coaching. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "spindrift serenity") without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in the woman's few words.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (e.g., "fog like a palimpsest") is consistent and purposeful, clarity untouched in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis of familiar tropes through grounded details (yarn needle, rain gutters) and the palimpsest metaphor. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; the final image feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric compression heightening stakes.</comment>
