<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her linguistic expertise, driving her choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, though internal conflict is subtle; her final decision to open the book is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the test of listening. Micro-choices like studying the diary reveal her values. Lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene, but strong for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara understands the mountain guards wisdom to test listeners, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to rescue to discovery. Orientation anchored early; constraint of the diary shapes tactics. Cost legible in the final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore as an instrument constrains every choice and charges the final image with the mountain's song. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's expertise. Setting is indispensable, shaping navigation and theme through acoustic properties and structure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the Library/rescuing scholars) escalates via Elara's agency: she uses the diary to renegotiate with the mountain, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in the test of listening. Under causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons and listening emerges organically from events, with subtext in the mountain's protective test. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: the Library is guarded to ensure wisdom is earned. Thematic resonance arises from particulars like the diary and frequencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature reflecting Elara's linguistic mind. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but natural. Elision (e.g., gaps in the diary) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "knowledge was geology." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is clear and charged. No artifacts obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis: mountain as bookstore, library of unlearned lessons, and acoustic navigation. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the botanical diary and Late Meridian. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
