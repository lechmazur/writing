<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's loneliness and visionary drive are embodied in concrete details (cold beans, talking to weather); her decision to broadcast arises from consistent motivation and shows micro-choices under pressure. The final realization—prophecy as a seed catalog—is earned by prior causality with cost visible in her solitude and the open dawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from discovery to action is tight; closure is a charged poise (she smiles, understands, waits) with cost legible in her isolation and the world's uncertain choice. The inferred causal lens holds, and the cobalt glass acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice: the observatory isolates, the cobalt glass amplifies signals, and storm-light charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping the future) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elara's agency in broadcasting, which tightens options and divides the world's response. Cost is unmistakable in the narrative's "some chose him, some chose her, most chose neither."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as tool, not destiny, emerges naturally from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("a seed catalog") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadows' fragmented transmissions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, blending poetic whimsy with gritty specificity; third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature clear in Elara's way of noticing. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but controlled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ancient shadows, radio transmissions, and a lonely visionary in a fresh, non-obvious way; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its implications.</comment>
