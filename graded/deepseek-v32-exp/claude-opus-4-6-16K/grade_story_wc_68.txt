<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maret’s interior contradiction (futility vs. duty) acts in scene; his earned endurance (Earned Stasis) is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in his flat voice and the weight of preserving knowledge. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion in "the familiar weight of futility."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maret continues scraping, crystallizing his stance with cost legible in "The lamp guttered. The city remembered nothing, so he remembered for it." Situational lens holds; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (sewer, sediment, cog) charges the final image and constrains choice. Sensory details (fish-oil lamp, black canal) are selective and POV-filtered. The sewer’s indifference to narratives mirrors theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. ideology) escalates through Maret’s agency: his realization about the cog and comment about drowning tighten pressure. Cost is felt in his isolation and the guttering lamp under the Situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (cog, sediment, factions) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of remembering. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature: philosophical, precise, abrasive calm. Voice modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Prose rhythm supports the reflective tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, vivid imagery, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; syntax varies naturally with the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic excavation and epistemological conflict feels inevitable. Specific details (chronometer cog, sedimentary layers) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
