<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is vivid and drives the narrative, but internal contradiction is minimal, limiting depth under pressure; no flaws or secondary pressure complicate her steady resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure with charged poise (Maren's continued work) lands with cost in honoring forgotten names, though the turn is subtle and lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements with grounded specifics; premise feels inevitable and fresh, though risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
