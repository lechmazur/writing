<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kael's emotional numbness is concretely embodied; her motivation to "vivify" drives the plot. The complementary opposition with Kael-2 is realized through contradictory impulses in scene—raw feeling versus cold precision—and their final renunciation of custody is earned by the sparring's transformative exchange. The cost is visible in the burial of the duplicate brain and the reconfiguration into two mothers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: ego death leads to dojo, clone encounter, sparring, and integration. Closure is a decisive change (Kael feels again, Kael-2 gains stillness) with felt cost in the brain's burial and the redefined family. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; the deep-time rewriting motif pays off thematically without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is not just vivid backdrop; it constrains choice (the sparring platform, burial site) and charges the final image with its geologic mutability. Sensory details ("wept mineral water into the void") are selective and filtered through Kael's perceptual bias. The setting's rewriting history mirrors the characters' internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional numbness vs. custody) escalates through the sparring, driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. Each blow and counter carries voltage and structure, tightening until the complementary completion forces a trade-off (burial of the duplicate brain). Cost is legible on the page in the final image and the redefined relationship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness through integration emerges from particulars—the sparring method, the brain in the jar, the burial—without moralizing. The final image (wind vivifying Kael, two mothers) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Kael is stable and apt; voice modulates with her numbness to awakening, syntax tightening under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven (Shen's slicing pretense, Kael-2's claim). Perceptual signature is distinct ("like a watercolor of a woman"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("history rewrote itself in layers of sediment and silence") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during sparring, breathes at closure. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cloning trope is transformed through philosophical depth and emotional specificity. The floating dojo and deep-time setting offer a fresh angle. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (complementary opposites as method) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
