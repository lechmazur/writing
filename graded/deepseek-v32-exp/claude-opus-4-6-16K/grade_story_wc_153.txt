<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction is concrete and embodied ("the space where an apology waits unspoken, trembling"), and her final renunciation (accepting the cycle of break/mend as devotion) is earned by the causality of reading the letters. The medium's "fierce tenderness" is slightly more told than dramatized in action, but it anchors the final gift. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible and layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's realization that "That is not failure. That is devotion" reconfigures the meaning of her grief and the unsent letters. Cost is legible on-page in the final image of carrying "a broken thing that knew how to mend." Orientation is immediate and functional; the single-scene structure tightens perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are not just atmosphere but pressure, narrowing channels physically and emotionally. The gargoyle shard is the definitive micro-setting object that constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Maren's urgency ("tones that pressed against the chest"). Spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the moment before deciding/closure with her mother) is signaled early. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening via the medium's ritual and the condensation's answers, which reweight Maren's understanding of her own letters. The cost is the relinquishment of seeking forgiveness for the more precise, unresolved "moment before deciding." Agency is her choice to read and then speak freely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (the devotion in cyclical breaking and mending, the overlap of silences rather than forgiveness) emerges wholly from the specific events and images—the letters, the shard, the condensation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image and the medium's pronouncement. No moralizing; subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (the unspoken replies).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third, with a distinct perceptual signature ("cathedral bones," "cracked thing"). Voice is consistent and textured, modulating under pressure without register drift. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying subtext ("They were for the moment you couldn't reach"). The lyric compression of the final paragraph is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually free of artifacts. One minor metaphorical strain ("a hand holding a cracked thing together" slightly mixes tactile and abstract) does not obscure clarity. Sentence-level propulsion expertly matches the scene's emotional cadence. Information density is high; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. No loops, scaffold, or decorative padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mangrove medium, unsent letters, and a gargoyle shard that heals in moonlight is specific, organic, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through grounded, emotional particulars rather than being a quirky checklist. The fresh inflection—redefining devotion as a daily mending, not a final fix—heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
