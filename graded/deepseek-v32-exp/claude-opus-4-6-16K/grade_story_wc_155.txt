<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Luma's motivation and interiority are vividly rendered, with concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to project the orchard is earned by the fresco fragment and her daydream, carrying the cost of ephemerality. However, contradictory impulses do not act simultaneously in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the temporary orchard and the quiet return of delight. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the fog and ruins shapes the final image. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with sensory detail ("mineral and sweet, like licking a wet stone") woven through action. The fog and fresco fragment constrain choice and charge the final image, elevating atmosphere beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscovering joy) escalates through Luma's agency—finding the fresco, daydreaming, projecting—culminating in a decision that forecloses inaction. Cost is legible in the projected orchard's impermanence and the sharing of documentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (exposed film, light painting) and the final realization reweights prior material. The explicit statement "Joy... was exposed film" edges toward moralizing, but the closing image of the tree blooming provides resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature fitting an artist. The voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (the daydream fold) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. The read-aloud test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of light-painting artist, ruined orchard, and knowledge network feels fresh and inevitable. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in a quiet, lyrical closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming a familiar arc.</comment>
