<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "reading the wood grain the way she once read wet clay"), and her final choice—to stay and build a kiln—is a credible Earned Stasis earned by her prior micro-choices (centering the clay, pressing the earth) and rooted in her lifelong question. The cost of her commitment is legible in the image of her remaining in the wasteland.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the oasis holding "in every timeline" reconfigures the central question through Sable's realization and commitment. The cost is felt in her decision to remain, anchoring the future. Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring the journey and enabling the revelation. The oasis, lantern glass, and acacia tree are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Sable's potter's perception ("mineral smell," "thin blade of shade").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: from observation to embodied understanding via the thrum and the "phototropic" realization. This deepens the stake (understanding why places endure) and narrows her options to the committed choice. The cost of foreclosing other paths is present in her settled resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the convergence of Sable's craft, the oasis's persistence, and the "phototropic to kindness" concept. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—kindness as an anchor across timelines—without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of the pots left for travelers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a potter's perceptual signature ("mind still as pond water," "body-knowledge of a potter"). POV is tightly controlled, third-person limited. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary, as in the thrumming passage entering her "sternum, her wrists, the base of her skull."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor hairline slips: a slight register elevation in "half-joke, half-koan" and a possible filter-verb cluster ("she could hear—or almost hear—"). However, these do not obscure closure, and the line-level craft is otherwise flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic survival, zen pottery, quantum-timeline mysticism, and ecological empathy is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded character choices. The story commits fully to its premise without gimmickry.</comment>
