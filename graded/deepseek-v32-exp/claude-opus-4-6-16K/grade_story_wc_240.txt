<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction between detection and permeability is embodied in concrete spatial giftedness; her final micro-choice to "let the morning in" is earned by the mushroom demonstration, with cost legible in the prior marital shrapnel. Yua applies precise pressure as a familiar stranger. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from opening image to closure; orientation anchored within 120 words. Closure is a decisive internal change ("become permeable") with felt cost of prior sealed state; the persistent constraint of her intrusion-detection career shapes the final reconfiguration. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm and laser pointer function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image of opening; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional perception. Spatial choreography clear, tone coherently supports theme of quiet transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (letting go vs. detection) escalates via accumulative density of the mushroom demonstration; Maren's agency in watching and asking "Show me again" drives the tightening. Cost is visible in the shift from sealed heart to permeable chest, foreclosing her old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of permeable barriers emerges through specific images (fungal cell walls, marital architecture) without moralizing; subtext operates in Yua's gestures and the spore release. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "physics of letting go" by reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (spatial architectures, intrusion mapping); voice is controlled and lyrical under pressure, e.g., "quiet wildfire made of light." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("like glass sculptures," "shrapnel") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates with the spore release and decelerates at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of intrusion detection with bioluminescent mycology feels inevitable; the familiar‑stranger trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk‑taking in metaphorical integration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision.</comment>
