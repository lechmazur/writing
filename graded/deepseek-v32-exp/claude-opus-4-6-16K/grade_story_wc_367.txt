<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation, but interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are subdued; her prophetic role feels more mystical than deeply conflicted in this scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—the final image of steering dawn reweights her role—but the felt cost is somewhat oblique, not visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely rendered and integral to theme, charging the final image; however, the lighthouse does not constrain a choice in the scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and dominant, but conflict is internal and static; escalation under the accumulative lens is a deepening via prophecy, yet protagonist agency is passive (prophecy is involuntary).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—dawn being steered—without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; perceptual signature is strong, with no head-hopping, and the poetic rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and artifact-free; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold, though the density may slightly slow momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of prophet, lighthouse, and post-collapse world; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
