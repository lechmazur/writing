<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives her revelations and micro-choices, earning her endurance at the closure with visible cost in her solitary watch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via Conceptual Repricing (riddle's answer is wonder) lands with cost in the silent city and fallen bees; orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting like "nectar dusk" and the tower charges the final image; the lacquer box as micro-setting constrains choice and enriches atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates through Maren's riddle-giving agency; cost is legible in the fading light and her continued wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. routine emerges through the riddle and Maren's reflection; ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with Maren's perceptual signature; dialogue distinguishes characters; voice is poetic yet controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of truth-telling, drone bees, and riddle feels inevitable; specific details and emotional truth elevate originality.</comment>
