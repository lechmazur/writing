<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's "tranquilly perceptive" nature is embodied in her choice to stay and her methodical examination; her final decision to index the truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the truth will cost something"), and interior contradictions (caution vs. conviction) act in scene without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and intellectual density to a Charged Poise closure where cost is legible on-page ("the truth will cost something... her contract would likely end"); the stamp's discovery and testing form a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("barnacled halls," "bioluminescent kelp") and pressures choice—the library's reclaimed stillness focuses Sable's perception, and the antique ink stamp as a micro-setting object constrains her action and charges the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. career) escalates under accumulative lens through Sable's agency in discovering and validating the stamp; cost is unmistakable on-page as she accepts professional fallout, foreclosing a path with "dappled resolve."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honest origins emerges through particulars like the stamp's sigil and the ledger's structure; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the honest origin... was indexed") without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Sable's quiet act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters detail through Sable's professional focus; prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "She wrote slowly, letting each word settle..."), and any elision (like the blackout's cause) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive without loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "The stillness held her like water holds a stone"); figurative language is consistent and clear, and closure image retains sharp clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sunken library, indexer, and blackout into a fresh, inevitable whole; risk-taking in quiet, internal conflict heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (e.g., the bone stamp's local provenance) anchors emotional truth.</comment>
