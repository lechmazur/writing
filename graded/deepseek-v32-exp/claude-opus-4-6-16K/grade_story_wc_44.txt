<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's quiet deliberateness is embodied in concrete actions and micro-choices, and her final decision stems from established causality. Internal conflict is shown through the struggle between hand-memory and new sight, but the choice moment lacks contradictory impulses in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (shadow returns) and felt cost (risk of waking the automaton). Causal lens holds tightly from spoons bending to loop closure; orientation is immediate; key constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the floating observatory and Ashenmere charge the final image, and the key as micro-setting constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's scholarly POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from observation to key extraction to loop closure. Stakes (shadow-feeding automaton) tighten meaningfully; cost is legible in her dilemma, though the stakes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (order, knowledge, responsibility) emerges organically from runes, shadows, and the sealed awakening. The final image of the returning shadow offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a scholarly perceptual signature. Voice modulates with pressure; purposeful compression (e.g., "curling in on themselves like fiddlehead ferns") is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is controlled and consistent; line-level craft supports closure without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of runic scholarship, reality-bending, and automaton mythology feels inevitable. Specific details (e.g., fiddlehead ferns, loop-runes) and risk-taking in the quiet climax heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
