<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's eclectic pacifism is concretely embodied through specific actions and objects; her final choice not to open the diary is earned by consistent traits and visible emotional cost, with interiority shown via embodied micro-choices like pressing her palm and weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page; the accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly; the locked diary clasp is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The roofless workshop and its contents are filtered through Maren's perception, constraining choice (the diary as obstacle) and charging the final image with the stars' return; sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the silence before fireworks) tightens via Maren's agency; escalation under the accumulative lens is a cadence shift that reweights the stake with emotional cost legible in her weeping and the final silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through listening to silence emerges from concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material via the recorded silence and the unopened diary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and silence; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle—even peak beats like "wept with the controlled grace" are clear and purposeful, advancing story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise of cataloguing silences is transformed through specific lived detail; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in quiet introspection heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
