<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vela's motivation is clear and intensifies, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final choice to become the surface for the dream is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vela erases boundaries, holding the dream in the sextant. The accumulative/textural lens is coherent, orientation is early, and cost is legible in the final image of "apple blossoms drifted like snow falling upward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the ruined orchard district and frost directly constraining Vela's tactics. The sextant as a micro-setting charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the dream) escalates through Vela's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in synchronized breathing that dissolves boundaries. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries between dream and reality emerges organically through images and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in mirrors and frost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Vela's perspective filters descriptions consistently, and purposeful compression supports the accumulative drive without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, no scaffolds or loops. Figurative language like "glass mountains" enhances clarity, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of mirror-making, sextant, and dream-catching, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
