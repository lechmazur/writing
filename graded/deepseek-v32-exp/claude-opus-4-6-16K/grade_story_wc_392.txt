<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nora's interior contradiction (professional stillness vs. simmering guilt) is concrete and embodied. Her final renunciation is earned by the lantern's discovery and the pattern of complicity, with visible cost ("settle into her chest like an anchor"). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through action and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: observation → discovery → realization → decision. Closure is a decisive change (writing "preventable") and a resonant reconfiguration ("finished being used") with felt cost (Bosch's impending call). Orientation is immediate; all turns stem from protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is a pressurized crucible: the tunnel's damp, copper smell and chalk outline charge the investigation. The lantern—a micro-setting object—constrains Nora's choice by triggering historical parallel and moral calculus, directly shaping the final image and its cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. career security) escalates through protagonist-driven discoveries: denied requisitions, missing screws, then the lantern. A single meaningful tightening—writing "preventable"—forecloses the path of compliance with a cost legible in her "anchor finding bottom."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (complicity, historical echoes of resistance) emerges through concrete particulars: the lantern, the denied logs, the fourteen files. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of leaving the lantern "in the dark, where someone might need its light again." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Nora's professional/historical consciousness. Voice is distinct, with a measured, forensic rhythm that tightens under pressure. No head-hopping; all reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the lantern, the chalk outline).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, accelerating with discovery. Figurative language ("like an anchor finding bottom") is precise and character-apt. No artifacts muddy closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a bureaucratic whistleblower narrative with the historical Underground Railroad motif. The lantern is not ornamental; it transforms Nora's calculus through specific, grounded parallels. Risk-taking in structure (single scene with embedded reflection) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
