<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's contradictory impulses—skepticism versus pilgrimage—are dramatized in scene, and her final felt sense of home is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her resignation and stolen amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing ("homecoming was not arrival...") with felt cost; the Accumulative lens holds via patterned density; the amber and signal shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed tower and fly amber constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Sera's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Sera's agency in climbing and reflecting; cost is legible in her emotional tightening and the reweighting of homecoming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of artificial pilgrimage and homecoming emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the amber's suspended flight, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping; diction matches Sera's analytical yet lyrical mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like something remembering how to speak") is coherent and advances pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first contact with personal pilgrimage feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric reflection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; details are specific and transformative.</comment>
