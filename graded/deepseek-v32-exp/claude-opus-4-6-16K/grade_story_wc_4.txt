<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, with micro-choices under pressure, but internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure lands with conceptual cost in the revealed history of poisoning and healing, and the persistent constraint of the photographs shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image; the lavender field and factory ruins constrain Maren's action of lingering and embody the theme of healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are emotional and thematic; escalation through deepening understanding driven by Maren's agency, with cost legible in the collective effort behind the lavender.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific; synthesis of puzzle archivist, arcs of light, and collective healing feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical structure that heightens stakes.</comment>
