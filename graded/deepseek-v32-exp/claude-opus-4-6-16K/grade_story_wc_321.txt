<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's ardent optimism is embodied through concrete actions (polishing brass, coiling ropes) and micro-choices (radioing with steady voice). Her resilience compels the climactic synchronization, and her final endurance is earned by prior causality. The cost is felt in the merged timelines and the rhythm she now carries, though contradictory impulses under pressure are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (timelines braided) and a resonant reconfiguration (Mara's continued showing up) with cost legible in the glowing hourglass and recovered minutes. Causal-hybrid lens holds tightly; the inciting incident, discovery, and collective action link because/therefore. Orientation is anchored early and the grotto's reveal pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (diesel and optimism, phosphorescent stone, fractal stars) are selective and purposeful. The grotto and hourglass constrain choice and charge the final image; the ferry itself functions as a micro-setting that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clear even during the fantastical transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ferry vanishing, timelines colliding) escalates through Mara's agency: she discovers the hourglass, radios other versions, and leads the synchronization. The tightening is causal, and the cost is visible in the merged city and the hourglass's eternal rhythm. One meaningful reversal (the decision to braid timelines) narrows options with a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (showing up as miracle, transient vs. permanent) emerges organically from particulars (the rag, the hourglass, the rhythmic stars). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though the line "proof that showing up is its own kind of miracle" leans slightly explicit. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("diesel and optimism," "fractal sky"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains consistent; radio dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (the junction's rules) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and vivid imagery. Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and coherent. Information density is high (e.g., "stalactites dripped light instead of water"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mundane commuter ferry with cosmic timeline mechanics, transformed through character-specific detail (deckhand who remembers names). The hourglass and rhythmic braiding feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending literary realism with speculative elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
