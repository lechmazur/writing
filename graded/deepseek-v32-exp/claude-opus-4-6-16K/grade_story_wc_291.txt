<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's prosopagnosia and methodical nature are consistently embodied, driving her investigation; internal conflict is minimal but her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her effort. The explicit motivation paragraph ("to awaken dormant empathy") slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words; closure lands on-page with a decisive change (case reopened) and resonant reconfiguration (mist clearing), cost legible in "for the first time... something had cleared." Face blindness as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail ("mist pooled... like something alive") and charges the final image; it constrains choice by being the evidence site and atmospheric pressure. Micro-setting (ribbon, easel) integrates into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving the cold case) escalates via Maren's agency—her sketching and deduction tighten options under causal lens; cost is felt in her clarity and the weight of the quarry's silence, though not visceral. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (seeing beyond surfaces, awakening empathy) emerges organically from Maren's condition and actions; subtext in hands and ribbon. The final paragraph's explicit statement ("to awaken dormant empathy") slightly moralizes, but the ending image (mist clearing) offers a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Maren's face blindness; voice is methodical and textured, rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and precise figurative language ("silence... furrowed"); no loops or scaffold. Information density high, every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative coherence maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind portrait artist solving a cold case feels inevitable; risk-taking in protagonist's disability heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (hands sketching, quarry) transform familiar tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
