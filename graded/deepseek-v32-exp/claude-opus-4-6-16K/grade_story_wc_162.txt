<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her final choice to jump is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the jump) and felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (drifting prism terrace, oak table) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening from realization to action; cost is legible in the jump, foreclosing the path of stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (necessary distances, thresholds) emerges through particulars without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a lyrical perceptual signature; POV is consistent, and prose rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high information density, varied rhythm, no artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-butterfly effect world with accumulative lyricism; fresh angle on familiar tropes, and risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
