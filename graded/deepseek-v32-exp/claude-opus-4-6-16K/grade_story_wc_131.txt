<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (hiding vs. wanting to be seen) act in scene; her final choice to wait is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of ending her hidden life. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "something inside her chest had unlocked"), and her methodical nature is shown through precise actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren waits to be seen, with cost legible in "For the first time in eleven months, Maren did not hide." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a decisive stance change. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice: the library's hidden anatomy enables Maren's expertise and her final offer. Sensory detail ("cold concrete," "sapphire hush") is selective and purposeful, charging the final image of dawn and steadying lights. The environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to become visible) is signaled early and tightens through Maren's agency—leaving objects, writing the note, waiting. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs via density increase, reweighting the stake with cost (vulnerability). One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (invisibility, memory, usefulness) emerges organically through particulars—the tape fragment, cached objects, Maren's note. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via the charged poise of waiting, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and matches Maren's methodical perception. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., the quiet cadence of the final wait). No head‑hopping; focalization is consistently filtered through her biases and memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences vary naturally; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with a resonant image. Craft supports propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and specific—a crawl‑space dweller using her knowledge of a library's hidden anatomy to seek connection. The synthesis of sense memory, cached objects, and a quiet stance change is organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in the interior, lyric focus heightens stakes.</comment>
