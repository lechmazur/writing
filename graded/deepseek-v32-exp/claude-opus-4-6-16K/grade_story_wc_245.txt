<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirael’s motivation is clear, rooted in her unique traits, and intensifies under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the stillpoint where contradictory emotions (loneliness, rage, love) arise simultaneously. The final choice to map and return is earned by the journey, with visible cost in her silent weeping. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional specificity avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each step (absorbing language, using the compass, dowsing) tightens options toward the stillpoint. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (“She wept without sound”). Orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of her ability shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through non-visual senses (ultrasonic frequencies, bark texture, quartz humming). The forest actively constrains navigation and supplies the musical map. The stillpoint as micro-setting charges the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Mirael’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal self-location) is signaled early and escalates through Mirael’s agency—dowsing, following the needle—culminating in the emotional cost of the stillpoint. One meaningful tightening (the trail of notes) forecloses other paths. Cost is legible in her weeping and the ring’s stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping internal landscapes emerges organically from action and image. Subtext operates in silence and the map titled “Here.” The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars (the musical notation, the carried silence).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, tactile, filtered through Mirael’s blindness and unique senses. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control supports pressure; purposeful elision (time passage) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high-density, with no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is precise and consistent (“like ink spreading through water”). Syntax and rhythm vary naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (blind mapmaker, skin-absorption of languages, ultrasonic forest) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The stillpoint as emotional coordinate transforms familiar quest tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
