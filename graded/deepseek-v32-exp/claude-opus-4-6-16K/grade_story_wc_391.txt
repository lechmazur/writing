<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion (e.g., "the same scream building inside her chest") and micro-choices under pressure. Her final patience is earned by prior causality, foreclosing rage with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) on the longest night, with cost legible in her restraint and the frozen lake image. Accumulative lens holds, orientation clear early, and the viaduct constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct) constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. corruption) escalates accumulatively through her growing archive. Agency in her patient work drives escalation, with cost unmistakable in her restrained fury and the season's passage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges through events and images (e.g., ice holding water). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping, and purposeful elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats (e.g., "sculpt patience from impatience").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping, corruption, and quiet revolution feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
