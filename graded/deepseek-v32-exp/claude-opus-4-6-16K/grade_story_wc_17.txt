<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's sensitivity and motivation are concretely embodied through her perception of the corridor's "breath" and the discovery of her grandmother's diaries. The final choice to speak and commit to finishing the work is earned by the revelation, with the burden of legacy transformed into signal. Interior contradiction is shown in her sensitivity as both curse and gift. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile detail and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the discovery of the diaries directly leads to her declaration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she reconfigures her legacy into purpose, with cost legible in the damp air and the answering whisper. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. The constraint of the crumbling brick and the diaries shapes the entire turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (the crumbled brick enables discovery) and charges the final image (the whisper answers back). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional acuity—sound, texture, dampness. The climate-shift backdrop is woven into the atmosphere without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the walls' memory and redeeming her grandmother's work) escalates through the protagonist's agency: she finds, reads, and acts. The tightening occurs when the diaries reveal the familial legacy, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the "burden" she accepts and the unanswered echo that answers her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational legacy and memory emerges through concrete particulars—the diaries, the negative, the resonances. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the burden becomes signal, and the walls answer. No moralizing; subtext operates in the parallel between architectural and familial memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptive signature. Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control in sentences like "The ivy-veiled passage breathed back at her." No head-hopping; perceptual bias shapes what is noticed (acoustics, decay, traces).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "the ivy-veiled passage breathed back"). Sentence rhythm varies to match contemplative and decisive beats. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate fiction, acoustic science, and familial legacy feels inevitable. The concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" and the idea that walls remember are fresh and fully committed. Risk-taking in the quiet, resonant ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
