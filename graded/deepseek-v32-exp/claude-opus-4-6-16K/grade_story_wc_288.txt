<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concretely embodied through specific memories and micro-choices; her transformation from isolation to independence is earned with visible cost in the final act of not moving the texts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she accepts her role, cost legible in her letting the mist come; the accumulative lens holds tightly, integrating memory and setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal library and sundial are not just vivid backdrops but actively constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density, driven by Maren's agency in writing and her decisive inaction at the end, with cost unmistakable in the risk to texts and her gained wholeness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and witness emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting isolation into independence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature; the prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is flawless, with high information density, varied syntax, and no loops or figurative muddle; every sentence advances character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tidal library, reincarnation memory, and atomic reflection feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
