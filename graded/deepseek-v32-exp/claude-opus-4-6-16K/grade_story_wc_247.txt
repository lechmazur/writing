<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction of joyful sorrow is embodied and drives micro-choices; Dalir's patience applies pressure, making her final renunciation-earned. Dalir's charisma is slightly told but sufficient for scope. No diagnostic label-speak; cost visible in grief/joy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost ("grief for the sound... joy for the new language"). Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation anchors early. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor and camera are sensory and purposeful; camera constrains choice in multiple beats and charges the final image. Setting mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting qualifies for 9+ via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in artistic mission escalates through Dalir's revelation, leading to Maren's active decision. Cost is legible on-page under accumulative lens. Agency drives tightening; no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language emerges through particulars (camera, signing, scores). Subtext in gestures and images; ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature shaped by silence. Voice lyrical and consistent; dialogue (signed and spoken) natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and coherent. Sentence variety supports rhythm; clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of translating silence to bridge deaf/hearing experience is fresh and specific. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in quiet, thematic resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Authentic vision.</comment>
