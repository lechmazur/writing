<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in synesthetic trauma; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., burgundy humming in molars). Her final choice to build the hearing aid is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren finds the frequency and decides to use it, with cost legible in the weeping image. Orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks) is vividly specific and pressures choice—Maren's recording depends on its absences. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image with the aurora and forge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the sound of trust breaking) escalates through Maren's active recording; agency drives the accumulation to a discovery with unmistakable cost (her weeping). Coincidence absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, absence, grief) emerges through concrete images and subtext (e.g., dividing cells, salt-stunted apples). Ending offers a non-literal answer—using frequency as warning—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature from Maren's synesthesia; voice is lyrical and consistent, prose rhythm controls pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (synesthetic hearing aid designer collecting absences); synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
