<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voss's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her sensory ability is concretely embodied. The final choice to build a map is earned by the vision's revelation, with cost felt in the "ballast" realization. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; causal lens holds from investigation to vision to decisive change. Closure lands with cost on-page: "weight of the withheld truth settled into Voss's chest." The shard's cyclical nature persistently constraints tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid through sensory details filtered through Voss's grafts. The repair bay and green shard constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting functions as crucible for the truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about mother) escalates through Voss's agency using the shard. The vision tightens options by revealing sacrifice. Cost is legible in her realization and decision to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth, sacrifice, and weight emerges from particulars without statement. The ending reweights prior material through "ballast" and map-building, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature via nerve grafts. Voice modulates with lyrical precision under pressure. Dialogue in vision is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear. Sentences propel the story without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel universes, and personal quest. Emotional truth anchors speculative elements. Risk-taking in structure (visions) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
