<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solenne's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interiority is concrete through actions like collecting threads, and the final change is earned with visible cost in her sigh and smile. However, she lacks internal contradiction, which slightly limits depth but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (freedom) and cost legible in the sigh and smile; the accumulative lens holds throughout, and the prism sanctuary as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the prism sanctuary amplifies echoes, crucial for the climax, and the silver courtyard under snow charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Solenne's agency in untangling and playing the thread, with cost felt in years of patience. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of freedom and rebellion emerges through events and images like threads and echoes, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with doors opening. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Solenne's perspective. No head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet controlled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, and sentence rhythm varies naturally. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan trope with threads and echoes feels inevitable; originality lies in quiet rebellion and the harvest concept, integrated organically with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
