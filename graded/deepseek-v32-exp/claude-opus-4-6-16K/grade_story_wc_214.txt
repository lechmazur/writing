<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory (seeking intimacy yet enduring solitude), and her final choice to empathize rather than report is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the gap between data and devotion). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. A slight tendency toward poetic abstraction is character-consistent and does not undermine motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where Maren’s stance crystallizes in stillness; cost is legible in her silent choice and the enduring distance from Dr. Luo. Two shards (anomaly night and Thursday) with one clean transition; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (isolated station, abandoned tools). The yellow glass and telescope recur and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren’s perception, with atmosphere (“flourishing stillness”) integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking connection vs. cosmic indifference) escalates through the anomaly, prompting Maren’s agential choice to empathize. A meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens: her attention forecloses the path of reporting, with cost felt in her continued solitude and the gap from scientific understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and motifs (stillness, glass, stars). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to face vastness, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, particularly in the final interaction with Dr. Luo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct poetic voice that matches Maren’s perceptual signature. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and controlled, with diction consistently within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs. Minor hairline slips in poetic density do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor and quiet metaphysical inquiry; tropes transformed through specific, grounded choices. The non-obvious angle on “contact” and the risk of a still, empathetic closure heighten stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
