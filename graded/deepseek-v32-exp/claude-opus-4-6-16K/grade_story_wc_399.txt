<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira's motivation—preserving echoes of wisdom without resistance—is clear, rooted in embodied contradiction (mourning lost poetry while consecrating ground for coexistence). Her final stance (feeling the line wide enough for company) is earned through on-page micro-choices (spiral drawing, peripheral awareness) and carries the cost of her burnt history. The prophet's presence applies immediate pressure, and his shift to careful speech results from her honest, tactical consecration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the line feels "wide enough for company," reconfiguring the boundary between old and new with felt cost (risk of overwriting, effort of consecration). Orientation is clean within 120 words; the kinetic parapet and clearings are persistent constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><environment, body/tool, or recurring object constrains choice or charges the final image: the murmuring columns, bone stylus, and sand are tactile elements that direct Lira's ritual; the kinetic parapet and conjured clearings actively shape the outcome and the closing atmosphere of "whisperfield calm."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving old wisdom alongside new) is signaled early and tightens with the prophet's early arrival—a complication that tests Lira's consecration. Escalation is driven by her agency (consecration, dialogue) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in the prophet's agreement to speak carefully, with cost legible in the clearings' fragile stability and her burnt past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (coexistence, memory vs. prophecy) emerges through concrete particulars (agricultural poetry lost, theorems of light, clearings as silence) and subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "line wide enough for company," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Lira's perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, tactile vibration). Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled under pressure; dialogue is minimal but natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext (e.g., "strangely honest for someone performing deception").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("clearings held steady like cupped hands") is purposeful and coherent; sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and the final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-keeping, prophecy, and geomantic ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices (line walking as a burnt, half-masked practice; kinetic parapet as stabilizing contradiction). Risk-taking in quiet, contemplative resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
