<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his craft, with micro-choices under pressure (the chip wilting at corner-cutting). Interiority is concrete but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, limiting the emotional complexity. Final endurance is earned with visible cost of focus and honesty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (chamber restored, light returns) with felt cost in the chip's wilting and Elias's exhaustion. Orientation is immediate, causality intact, and the final image of the child's laugh charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice (rust must be tuned, not removed); sensory detail is selective and purposeful (humming, flickering light). The chamber and chip function as micro-settings that charge the final image of luminous walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring light) escalates via Elias's agency and the chip's wilting, forcing a tightening of attention. Cost is legible in the wilting and the hours of delicate work. One meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending imperfection emerges through particulars (rust transformed, chip's honesty). Ending offers a non-literal answer: harmony achieved by integrating flaw. No moralizing; subtext in the builders' original limitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, with a craftsman's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; diction matches tone and character. Rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; closure image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of music box repair, philosopher's stone, and rust covenant feels organic and inevitable. Specific, grounded details transform familiar tropes; risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
