<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sable's grief and professional identity drive her to the glade; her "willingly perplexed" acceptance of the reading and the final choice to return are earned by prior causality with visible cost—the understanding that lost time becomes beauty, not a recoverable resource.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear by ~120 words; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final lines: "The time ahead was not a replacement for the time behind, but it was time, and it was hers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glade, saucer, and cards are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is vivid and selective, woven through action and perception, with the crack in the saucer pointing the way home.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where lost time accumulates) escalates through Sable's active reading and realization; agency drives the deepening, and cost is felt in the acceptance that time lost is not recovered but transformed into the glade's beauty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (cracked saucer, tracing hands, cloudbound repentance); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "You do not get the time back. You get the glade."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is character-specific (cartomancer's attention to ink, cracks, and patterns); no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., the birth backstory) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("moonlight like columns in a ruined cathedral") is consistent and purposeful, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and emotional truth; specific, non-obvious elements (onyx-ink cartomancy, glade accessible by grief, tracing-hands method) feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
