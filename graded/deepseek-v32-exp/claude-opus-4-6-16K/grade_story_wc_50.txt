<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's reflective locksmith nature is embodied in concrete micro-choices and contradictory impulses—her rational cataloging conflicts with emotional tears, culminating in an Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority is specific and avoids stock phrasing; the final renunciation is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in her tears and the cavern’s lingering “wonder.” The cavern’s echo constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly sensory and actively pressures choices—its reflection angles dictate Sable’s methods and the echo transformations. The setting charges the final image, where scattered tears become part of the cavern’s held echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (storing wonder via reason) escalates through Sable’s agency as she speaks test words, each return deepening the mystery until the “wonder” echo forces a reweighting. Cost is unmistakable in her trembling and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (reason vs. ineffable wonder) emerges through the echoing transformations and Sable’s logged data versus wet eyes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—wonder persists beyond cataloging—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and filtered through Sable’s perceptual signature: professional, precise, yet lyrical. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control and purposeful compression (e.g., “the cavern breathed out”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“colors no one had named”) is purposeful and clear; information density is high without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise (harvest of echoes, locksmith mapping temporal pockets) is a fresh, specific synthesis. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes; the core concept feels inevitable in hindsight and integrates fully.</comment>
