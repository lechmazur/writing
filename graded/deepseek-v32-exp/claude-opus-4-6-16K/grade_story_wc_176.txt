<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular; Siv's grief and thaw are embodied in the "stone in her sternum" and the forgiveness that "did not feel like absolution so much as thaw." Her technically gentle hands and the act of braiding reveal character under pressure. The final choice—whispering the name—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the image of thaw and flow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words (Siv descending glacier stairs into sanctum). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory and thematic detail escalates to a Resonant Reconfiguration (illumination and whispered name) with felt cost—the "snowmelt ardor" of something frozen remembering it can flow. Closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the icebound sanctum and aurora light are not just atmosphere but actively constrain and enable the climax—the rope catches the light at a new angle to project the names. The rope itself functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Siv's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names and personal redemption) is signaled early and tightens through Siv's act of reconfiguring the rope. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift: the rope illuminates, reweighting the stake with cost—the "thaw" of her long-held grief. Agency is clear and drives the single meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: lost wax casting, punched card, rope braiding explore memory, erasure, and preservation through paradox. Subtext operates in image and implication (e.g., "monument to its own vanished original"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the whispered name like a bell—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical, precise, and reflects Siv's perceptual signature (e.g., "patience the way rivers know stone"). Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional pressure, achieving compression without obscurity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "grief... becomes its own kind of erasure"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive and climax with clarity and elegance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting, punched card encoding, ceremonial rope braiding, and icebound sanctum is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth anchors the speculative elements; risk-taking in quiet, introspective plot heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived detail.</comment>
