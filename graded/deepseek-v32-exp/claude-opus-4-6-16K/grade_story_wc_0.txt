<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's scientific detachment and emotional thaw are rendered through concrete interiority and micro-choices (photographing dust, then stopping). The final phone call and kept photograph are earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the strained relationship with her mother. Hairline slip: the eulogy backstory is told, not shown, but the compression is necessary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the final image of the photograph and the realization about humility. Cost is felt in the repaired relationship and the reweighted view of her work. Orientation is immediate; two-shard structure (greenhouse, then later) is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse and butterfly dust are vivid, sensory, and fully integrated. The dust patterns function as a micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains her attention. No generic placeholder; all details serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between scientific detachment and emotional resonance) escalates through density of reflection and the decisive beat of stopping cataloging. Agency drives the turn; cost is visible in the eulogy fallout and the phone call's unscripted apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from the neutron star/butterfly dust juxtaposition. The final photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the last paragraph, but the reweighting remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature blending scientific precision and lyric observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; dialogue (phone call) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear. Sentences vary effectively; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high, advancing story and character simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and butterfly dust feels inevitable in hindsight. The perspective is fresh and specific; the final image reconfigures prior material without gimmickry. Authentic artistic stance.</comment>
