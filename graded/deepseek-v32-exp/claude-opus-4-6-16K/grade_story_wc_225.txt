<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maret's guilt and determination are embodied through concrete actions like fidgeting; her final choice to guide the prince's hand is earned by seven years of decoding, with visible cost in her hands stilling. Interior contradiction (pride vs. remorse) is shown, not summarized. The resolution forgives her humanity without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: teaching the gambit causes the freeze, decoding the tapestry reverses it. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—rain falls, Maret's hands still—anchored in her agency. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks touch the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen village pressures every choice; the tapestry and board constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details like "rain hung suspended like glass beads" are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (tapestry border) is indispensable to the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undoing the freeze) escalates through Maret's active decoding, narrowing options to one final thread. Cost is legible in seven years of solitude and her trembling stillness. Agency drives the tightening under a causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, patience, and self-forgiveness emerges through particulars—frayed threads, folded coat—without statement. The final realization that "the tapestry's final lesson was the patience required to find it" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; subtext in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: chess tutor's intelligence filters details like "frayed threads in patterns." Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional pressure. Dialogue (prince's "Did I win?") is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("amber of stopped time") is consistent and clear. Sentences advance character and plot; peak beats avoid muddle. Read-aloud ear test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess, time magic, and redemption feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific detail—platinum labyrinth, tapestry decoding. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
