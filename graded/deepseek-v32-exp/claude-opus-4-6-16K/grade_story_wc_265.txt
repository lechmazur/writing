<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent; interiority concrete (weeping, laughing). Micro-choice to place gear under tongue shows alignment. No internal conflict or contradictory impulses, but final choice earned by prior openness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: Maren in new cradle, humming with forest. Accumulative lens holds. Orientation clear early. Cost legible in surrender and translocation. Persistent constraint (forest's will) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific and integral; mechanical rainforest and gear constrain choices and charge final image. Sensory detail selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding forest's thinking) escalates via deepening perception. Agency in attention and gear use. Cost is conceptual surrender, felt in final translocation. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift reweights stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wild frontier emerges through images and events, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: humming back opens frontier. Gear and wind-sound motifs reweight prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable, voice distinct and lyrical. Perceptual signature strong (philosopher's filter). No dialogue. Rhythmic control under pressure, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose dense, poetic, with zero loops or scaffold. High information density, clear propulsion. Figurative language consistent and vivid. No overwriting or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mechanical rainforest, sixth sense, and philosophical quest feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, non-obvious angle.</comment>
