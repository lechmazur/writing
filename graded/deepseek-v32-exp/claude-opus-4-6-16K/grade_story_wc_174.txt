<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete and contradictory, moving from performed serenity to a recognition of his own detachment. His final choice—to hand the stage over—is earned by Petra’s accusation and his reflection on the story stick’s "reversal," foreclosing his prior artistic path with the visible cost of terror. The emotional progression is credible, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: Petra’s argument (inciting incident) triggers Marcus’s reflection, leading to his epiphany and decisive on-page choice. Closure is a decisive change (he will reverse his method) with felt cost ("That terrifies you," he said. "Yes."). The final image of the "broken receiver" serves as a resonant conceptual repricing, deepening the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is economically vivid and purposefully integrated. The cracked radar dome ("halved skull") and its blade of starlight establish tone, mirror Marcus’s fractured work, and crucially charge the final image. The environment constrains choice (the isolated hush prompts reflection) and the object (story stick) is handled to tilt his decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical integrity of storytelling) is signaled early via Petra’s accusation. Escalation is driven by Marcus’s agency under the causal lens: his internal reversal tightens options, forcing a concrete proposal to Petra. Cost is legible in his admission of terror and the reconfiguration of their collaboration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of exploitation vs. empowerment emerges organically from character conflict and the central metaphor of reversal. Subtext operates through image (the dome as broken receiver, the half-lit epiphany). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Marcus’s calligraphic perception. Voice has a distinct texture ("meteor-hush glow"). Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying subtext and goal pursuit (Petra’s "That's where the real story starts"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor potential for a template cadence in a few reflective sentences, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle that obscures the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of urbane calligrapher, subversive puppetry, and ethical reckoning is fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
