<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's synesthetic ghost is vividly realized with embodied emotion and consistent motivation; her choice to sing and give the coin flows from her encore-seeking nature. Darla's brief presence adds secondary pressure. Lacks internal contradiction in peak beats, but micro-choices reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held: closure is a Charged Poise where Marguerite's encore reconfigures possibility for Darla and herself, cost legible in Darla's "warm certainty" and Marguerite's "nostalgia like sap." Fractured timeline taught early and pays off in layered echoes; orientation clear, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard and maze are indispensable, constraining access and enabling the coin's passage; sensory detail filtered through synesthesia charges every beat. The silver-barked trees and humming fruit shape the final image, making setting actively pressure the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is density increase: Marguerite's song echoes multiply, intertwining with Darla's breath to force a cadence shift. Agency drives the turn (singing, giving coin), cost visible in Darla's vertigo shift and Marguerite's nostalgic peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of performance, memory, and solace emerges through particulars—tarot coin, fractured echoes, synesthetic tastes—without statement. Final image of Marguerite beginning another song offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights encores as enduring kindness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, anchored in Marguerite's synesthetic perception; clean shift to Darla's POV at section break. Rhythmic control under pressure, with patterned elision (fractured timeline) taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "time fractured like transparencies") is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentence propulsion varies naturally, climax beats clear, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost, synesthesia, fractured timeline, and tarot coin feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in detail (e.g., "applause tasted of warm bread") avoids template plots.</comment>
