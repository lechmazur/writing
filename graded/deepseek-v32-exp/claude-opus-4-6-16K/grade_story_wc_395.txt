<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is precise and compelling; her "brightly attentive" nature is embodied through concrete actions like feeling "the texture of data." Her final choice to leak information is earned by prior causality—the discovery of the hidden profiles and her director's lie—and carries a clear, felt cost of personal and professional risk. The only minor slip is a slight diagnostic label in "she knew it the way she knew corrupted data by its smell," but the embodied instinct immediately follows, mitigating the issue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot operates on a tight causal chain under a clear Causal lens: the 7-22 pattern leads to the hidden partition, which reveals the conspiracy, forcing Lena's decisive act. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise ("The archive hummed on, but the silence inside it had changed") where cost is legible in the expectant, ghost-filled silence and the irrevocable act of sending the data. The structure is a seamless two-shard sequence (discovery/investigation → final act) with one transition, perfectly scaled to the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The social network archive is not just backdrop; it is the story's crucible, a "liminal" space that pressures Lena's choices and supplies the key evidence. It constrains and enables the entire plot. Sensory detail is expertly filtered through Lena's professional POV ("hummed in frequencies," "feel the texture of data"). The final image of the archive's changed silence is charged by this established environment, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are cleanly signaled (uncovering a corporate secret) and escalate through Lena's agency under the Causal lens: each discovery narrows her options and raises the personal cost. The key tightening is Desmond Harke's lie, which transforms the conflict from a technical puzzle to a personal danger, forcing her to go outside the system. The cost is legible in the final, irreversible act of pressing send and the reconfigured silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, data, and corporate erasure emerge organically from the concrete particulars of Lena's work and the 43 hidden profiles. Subtext is rich in the recurring numbers as a "count" and the "sensed absence." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the archive's charged silence and the "ghosts" drawing breath, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person filtered through Lena's technical, poetic perception. Voice has a distinct texture blending corporate jargon and lyrical metaphor ("data lingered like furniture in an abandoned house"). The perceptual signature—noticing through data patterns and almost-remembered songs—is consistent and deepens character. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually free of line-level artifacts. Sentences do multiple jobs ("Data never truly disappeared; it just became harder to hear, like the echo of forgotten songs..."). There is no synonym churn, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines are powerfully mirrored, and the rhythm supports the story's mounting pressure and eerie resolve.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a fresh, memorable synthesis of corporate thriller, digital mystery, and subtle sci-fi. The concept of a "Memory Keeper" in a data archive uncovering a conspiracy through metadata patterns feels original and specific. The risk of a quiet, technologically-mediated climax pays off with a resonant, charged poise. The core elements feel organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven.</comment>
