<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction ("never" vs. amnesty) is concretely embodied; her final choice to play is earned by prior causality (the flake, map, her trade) with visible cost—the release of old selves. Micro-choices (studying map, lifting fiddle) reveal a hierarchy of values. The hitchhiker applies secondary pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where music makes forgiveness "load-bearing"; cost is legible in the flake warming and face gaining definition. Two shards (past/present) are taught early and transition smoothly. Orientation is anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the gorge and guardrail constrain choice (she plays the rail, not a bridge) and charge the final image of "returned sound." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("clouds settled... like cotton packed into a wound"). Spatial choreography with listeners is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness vs. internalized "never") is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: her choice to play reweights the stake, foreclosing despair. Cost is visible in the transformation of the photograph and map. Agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented amnesty emerges wholly from particulars (collodion flake, map's pixels, bridge-song). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—forgiveness "whole in aggregate" through music. No moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication ("a pardon assembled dot by dot").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her trade ("reading the micro-expressions of strangers"). Lyrical compression is pattern-taught and legible. Diction and rhythm heighten pressure without obscurity ("pixelated amnesty... Forgiveness rendered in fragments"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the music. Information density is high; every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of bridge-song fiddler, wet-plate photography, and "pixelated amnesty" is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail and a non-obvious emotional calculus.</comment>
