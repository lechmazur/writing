<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her shift from clairvoyant reliance to present acceptance is earned through micro-choices under pressure, with visible cost in her laughter. Sable provides sufficient secondary pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the laughter became part of the song." Orientation clear early, and the cave's constraint shapes the entire progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable—crystal cave's properties silence Maren's gift and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, POV-filtered, and directly constrain choice and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeing vs. being present) escalates through density increase under Accumulative lens; Maren's agency in attention and admission drives the tightening, with cost unmistakable in her realized loss and gain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—future vs. present, prediction vs. experience—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the cave's song and Sable's line, "Nobody does."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maren; voice has a distinct lyrical perceptual signature that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of clairvoyance and sensory presence; specific details (cave pearl, shadows) feel inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
