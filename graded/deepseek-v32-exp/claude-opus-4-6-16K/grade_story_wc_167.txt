<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her profession and worldview. Her final choice—to listen and read between the lines—is earned by the preceding reflections on ripples and glass, with visible cost in accepting her daughter's return on different terms. The closure is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren crystallizes her stance to meet Lise, with cost legible in the final image of the stone's rings. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, pattern is taught early, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Maren's glazier perception and charges the final image. Pearl Bay, the prism atrium, and the rippling water are essential to the story's logic and atmosphere, constraining choice by providing the concrete stimuli for her reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's relational and internal conflict) tightens through her reflective agency under the Accumulative lens. A single meaningful deepening occurs as she moves from memory to decision, with cost visible in her renunciation of asking Lise to stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of glass, light, and ripples, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how small gestures disturb the world, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Maren's professional attention to light and fracture. The voice is consistently poetic and reflective, modulated by emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and theme with concision. The final paragraph lands with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of glazier craft, ripple patterns, and a quiet parental reckoning feels fresh and organic. The story takes lyrical risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, and the perspective is memorably specific.</comment>
