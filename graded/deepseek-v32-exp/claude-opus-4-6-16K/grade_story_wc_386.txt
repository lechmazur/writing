<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied; her final choice to deliver evidence is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the flickering candles and smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a charged poise with cost (candles flicker as if in relief); orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of dream analysis shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; the melted snow globe as a recurring object charges the final image and constrains choice as key evidence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maren's agency in piecing together clues; cost is legible in the final image of relief and connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of restoring voice emerges through concrete images (windows, snow globe); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice remains consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, dense, and artifact-free; figurative language is purposeful and clear; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and investigative mystery; specific details (dream cameos, glacier shrine) create a unique, inevitable-feeling narrative.</comment>
