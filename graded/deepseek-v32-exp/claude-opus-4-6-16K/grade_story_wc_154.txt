<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply specific: her translator's eye, her trauma, and her determination to help Ratu are rendered through concrete interiority and micro-choices. The final act of writing—fighting anesthesia to graft new meaning—is earned by her history and the decoding beat, with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (weakness vs. resolve) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the coral-as-porous-heart image, reweighting translation and healing with undeniable cost (her struggle against the anesthetic). Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure with anchored reflection supports a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the brain coral fragment are not just atmospheric—they pressure choice (she chooses the garden over recovery) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Lena's POV, with the coral acting as a micro-setting that constrains and reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (grafting new meaning onto old wounds) tighten through Lena's decoding of Ratu's cast, a deepening driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in her fight against the anesthetic to write; the escalation forecloses the option of passive recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of translation, trauma, and the coral object. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the porous heart—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person close POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Lena's translator mind—noticing tremors of meaning, language patterns. Voice modulates with anesthetic haze but remains coherent; no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language ("lotus-hearted ache") is purposeful and consistent. The final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of war-translator, medical recovery, and a child's cast is fresh and specific. The coral as central image transforms a familiar healing trope through grounded, irreducible particulars. Risk-taking in the quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
