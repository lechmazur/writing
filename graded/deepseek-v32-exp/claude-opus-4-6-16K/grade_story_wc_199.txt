<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lirren's orderly nature is concretely embodied through precise sorting actions; her motivation to decode the leaves intensifies credibly, compelling her to build monuments. The final transformation into "the translator" is earned by her prior, patient cataloging and the active choice to construct, with the cost of her old purpose foreclosed. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, showing emotion through trembling fingers and whispered dialogue with the arbor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: patterned leaf-fall deepens into a message, leading to monument-building and a decisive change (becoming the translator). Closure lands on the page with the moth image and the "fresh symbols" returning, a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost—her purpose is permanently reconfigured. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "ashen skyborne arbor" is a micro-setting that actively pressures and enables the plot: the platform, the falling leaves, and the petrified wood constrain Lirren's actions and supply the key symbols. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her expertise ("wan light," "moss-covered railing"). The environment charges the final image, with the arbor shuddering and leaves erupting upward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the message) is signaled early and escalates through a clear, agency-driven sequence: observing patterned leaves, assembling symbols, and choosing to build monuments. This meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens forces a trade-off (her old orderly life) and culminates in a transformation where cost is legible in her new, endless cycle of sorting "fresh seeds of meaning."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory, transformation, and finding purpose through attentive care) emerges organically from concrete particulars—sorting seeds, building tiny cairns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Lirren becomes the bridge between remembering and forgetting, a conceptual repricing achieved through image (the dissolving moth) rather than statement. Subtext operates richly in the leaves' symbols and the moonstone's refraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to botanical and folkloric detail ("pale branches spread like veins"). The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional beats, from methodical sorting to "moss-green delight." No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., the folklore page's tale) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax ("the arbor shuddered"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor overwriting in early description ("sky the color of spent hearths") is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of orderly cataloging, arboreal prophecy, and monumental grief-transformed-into-celebration feels fresh, inevitable, and fully committed. Tropes (the chosen decoder) are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is uniquely resonant.</comment>
