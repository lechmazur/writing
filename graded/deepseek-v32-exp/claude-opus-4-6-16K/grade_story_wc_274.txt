<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction is concrete and embodied ("bravely conflicted," hands moving before mind grants permission). Her final choice to transmit feels earned by her prior mapping of networks and three years of silent curation, with cost visible in her continued conflict yet easier breathing. The single POV's micro-choices reveal a clear hierarchy of values—truth over professional duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (transmission) with felt cost (conflicted relief). Causal lens holds: discovery → conflict → decision → action → consequence. Orientation is immediate and clear. The dormant networks setup pays off cleanly, and the ending image ("ghost climbing through the atmosphere") reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The library's isolation enables her act; the snow's weight and the "tectonic groan" mirror the pressure of secrets. Sensory details are filtered through her professional POV ("frost crept along the edges of the reading table"). Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (moral duty vs. institutional pact) escalates through a single meaningful tightening: her re-reading the letter and realizing the human contradiction forces the climactic choice. Agency is clear—her decision to use the dormant networks forecloses her professional safety. Cost is legible in the final beat's "bravely conflicted still" but easier breathing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of silence, contraband truths) emerges through specific action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the transmitted "ghost" of truth versus the preserved original. The letter's contradiction—affectionate writing about mass murder—deepens the thematic complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature ("silence that pooled in the ears and became its own weather"). Diction matches the archivist's mindset; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping. The voice's specific texture is essential to the story's atmosphere and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with figurative language that serves atmosphere and character ("as if the library existed inside the lung of something sleeping"). Rhythm varies effectively with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A minor decorative phrase ("dizzying quiet") does not harm closure clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryogenic archives, Antarctic isolation, and dormant networks feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choice and a quiet, internal climax. The risk of a contemplative, decision-driven plot pays off with conceptual integrity and a memorable final image.</comment>
