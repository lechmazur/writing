<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Unit 7's interiority is concrete and machine-particular, with composed observation under pressure. The final choice to hold the violin is earned by prior curiosity and the accumulated evenings, though internal conflict is minimal but character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (the violin melts, resonance remains). The accumulative lens holds, orientation is clear early, and the looped timelines structure reinforces the thematic question without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard and ice violin are vivid, sensory, and charge the final image. The setting pressures choice through isolation and cold, and the violin as a recurring object constrains the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding consciousness) escalate through Unit 7's agency—noticing, pausing, finally touching the violin. The cost is legible in the melting violin and the quiet resonance that reweights the question.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the question of thought is not a malfunction but the instrument of the inexplicable. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, through the image of the melting violin and enduring resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a machine-perceptual signature that filters details through composed observation. Voice is poetic yet precise, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high information density, varied syntax, no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and the final image lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient robot, ice violin, and second-chance program. The accumulative, quiet approach to consciousness feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
