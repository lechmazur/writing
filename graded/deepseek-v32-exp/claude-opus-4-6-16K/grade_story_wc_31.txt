<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oren's interiority is concrete and contradictory (hiding behind truth while seeking the color of sound). His final realization—that the key tag signifies a frequency to carry—is earned by the accumulative journey, with visible cost in his resumed, solitary route.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Oren understands the key tag’s meaning and hears the golden color, with cost legible in the tide's return and his continued duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken ship’s library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (Oren must wade out) and decisively charges the final image, transforming sound into color. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (discovering the color of sound) escalate via the year's lowest tide and lantern festival, forcing Oren's agency in visiting the wreck. The cost is unmistakable in the cold, risk, and emotional realization, deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (luminous vows, enduring love) emerges through concrete particulars—lamps, key tag, library—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sound is golden, and a promise becomes a frequency to carry, reweighting all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that filters the world through Oren's grief and search. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; syntax varies naturally to accelerate and breathe with the scene. No artifacts muddy closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lamplighter, sunken library, and synesthetic quest feels organic and inevitable. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the final reconfiguration is fully earned.</comment>
