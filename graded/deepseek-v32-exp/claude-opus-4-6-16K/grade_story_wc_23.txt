<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's grief and patchwork expertise are embodied through concrete actions (the censer foot, soldering) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance—listening night after night—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitary persistence. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and contradictory impulses (hope versus loss) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren attains "raw solace" and reconfigures her stance toward an ongoing search. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with cost legible in the final image of her turning slowly. Orientation is clear early; causality from calls to building to listening is tight. The moon-phase constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The signal station and censer foot are indispensable: the frozen dishes constrain action, the remote starlit atmosphere presses on choice, and the bronze foot charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding trace of Lila) escalates through Maren's agency—building the receiver, climbing the gantry, listening—under the Accumulative lens. A meaningful tightening occurs when the signal proves the distance is navigable; cost is felt in her endurance and the "raw solace."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss and trace emerges from particulars (censer foot, signal, coordinates) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the signal maps "the geography of loss," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, blending lyrical precision with scientific detachment, mirroring Maren's patchwork expertise. POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect her state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("stars pressed down like a weight"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio astronomy, grief, and supernatural mystery feels inevitable. The censer foot and reverse migration concept are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
