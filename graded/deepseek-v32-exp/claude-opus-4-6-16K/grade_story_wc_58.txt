<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with Eli's loneliness and Maren's purpose rendered through specific gestures and micro-choices. The final endurance (Eli remaining, Maren writing) is earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible in the thread image and impending departure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as Eli's duty versus his loss, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost in the "fraying thread" and explained absence of spring departure. Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, oriented early. The persistent constraint of the thread shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective, with the garden and thread constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details (bruised light, brittle leaves) reflect POV bias and mirror internal states. The thread as micro-setting reweights the closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency: Maren's obituary writing and Eli's endurance deepen the stake of absence. Cost is legible in the final line and image of the fraying thread. One meaningful tightening (the intimate conversations) forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence and healing emerges organically from particulars like the thread and obituaries. Subtext operates in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final obituary line without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Maren's) is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (obituaries for the living) is fresh and synthesized through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, with non-obvious transformation of tropes.</comment>
