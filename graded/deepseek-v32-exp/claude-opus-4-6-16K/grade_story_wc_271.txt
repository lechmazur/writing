<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Noor's characterization is concrete and embodied; her trauma manifests as somatic freezing, and her gardening reflects a quiet competence. The final choice to pin the photograph is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing simple recovery with visible cost (shaking hands, crooked planting). The brief therapy-speak ("somatic markers") is a minor diagnostic intrusion but is quickly anchored in practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Noor pins the photo, reweighting her relationship to memory. Cost is legible in the crooked lavender and her trembling. Orientation is immediate; structure (present-backstory-present) is taut and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting is indispensable, constraining choice (practice at the edge, salvaged greenhouse) and charging the final image. Sensory details (salt wind, thyme, copper light) are selective, vivid, and fully filtered through Noor's perception. The environment actively pressures her healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal peace vs. traumatic memory) escalates cleanly under the accumulative lens via the pneumatic drill trigger. Noor's agency in finding the "pearl of stillness" is a decisive internal turn. Cost is unmistakable on the page (shaking for an hour, replanting crooked).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of growth amidst devastation emerges organically through the photograph, the pearl, and the act of tending trees. The final image (pinning the photo, watering pines) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Noor's perceptual signature (botanical, trauma-attuned). The lyrical, meditative voice modulates with emotional pressure without losing coherence. No dialogue, but the internal voice is distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with purpose. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs ("The pearl. Small, imperfect, luminous."). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The minor clinical tinge of "somatic markers" is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD recovery with arboretum stewardship is fresh and specific. The "pearl of stillness" concept transforms a therapeutic idea into a lyrical, earned image. The story commits fully to its premise, avoiding cliché through grounded, particular detail.</comment>
