<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is vividly embodied through physical sensations like anxious elation and pulsing scars; her root-bound nature and purposeful curiosity drive every choice, culminating in an earned unbounding with visible cost in her trembling step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage from hedge-reshaping to scar-discovery to key-activation is seamless; closure lands with a decisive change as Sable steps into the convergence, the cost legible in her scars and the sky folding shut like a book.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and labyrinth are micro-settings that pressure choice; the boxwood clipping and scars function as tactile objects that constrain action and charge the final image with transformative weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the maze's convergence of dreams, forcing Sable's agency in using the scar-map; the cost of her years of service and the terror of arrival are felt in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the maze as map of unconscious; the ending reconfigures the intersection as a moment where dreamer and dream merge, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and filtered through Sable's perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping, supports the accumulative density of dream imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes labyrinth keeper with dream cartography in a fresh, inevitable way; risk-taking in abstract concept is grounded by specific details like the scar-pattern and boxwood key.</comment>
