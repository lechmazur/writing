<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation and interiority are concrete, and her final stance as translator is earned by the discovery, but the character is more observer than conflicted agent, with no visible cost or contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (Maren as translator, the cave's gratitude) with clear conceptual cost; orientation is immediate and pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory; the elm leaf fossil as micro-setting charges the final image, and the cave network is essential to the emotional architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (documenting the unknown) escalates through deepening discovery under the accumulative lens; agency is present but cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (translation, gratitude) without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic registers; voice is consistent and controls rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense without loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion matches the accumulative cadence, and figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping, planetary hibernation, and transitional object concept; risk-taking in quiet, contemplative plot feels inevitable and specific.</comment>
