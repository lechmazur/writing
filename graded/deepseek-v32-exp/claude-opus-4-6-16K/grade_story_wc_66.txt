<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied, her copyist skills essential to the resistance, but the scene lacks interior contradiction or contradictory impulses under pressure, which caps the score below the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration of silence and dust, with legible cost in the risk and the final image; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and the constraint of the story famine shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember alcove, radio glow, and dust motif are sensory and specific, charging the final image; the setting functions as a micro-environment that reweights meaning, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Maren's active decoding; her agency drives a meaningful tightening, and the cost of resistance is felt in the altered silence at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of preservation; the final image of dust listening offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with a copyist's perceptual signature and rhythmic control; the prose maintains a consistent, lyrical distance that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with high information density and varied rhythm, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes dystopia, art, and resistance with specificity; the quiet, accumulative design feels inevitable in hindsight and commits fully to its conceptual risks.</comment>
