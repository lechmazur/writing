<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and particular, with her temporal displacement embodied in her perception ("stars moved at a pace imperceptible... she could see them breathing"). Her motivation to transform confusion into exploration is dramatized through sketching, and her final choice to sketch again is earned by the letter's arrival. A minor deduction for a moment of summarized interiority ("She had not known where true north was for a long time") which, while functional, slightly abstracts a peak emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren begins sketching again, redefining "true north" through her daughter's act, with the cost of eleven years' separation legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building through patterns of sketches and the compass rose. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constraining: the observation deck's "faint hum" and the viewport create a micro-setting that embodies her displacement. The recurring compass rose object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her stretched perception (e.g., stars "crawl like slow rivers"), all serving the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (reconnection with her daughter) are signaled early and tighten meaningfully with the arrival of Lise's letter and the returned compass rose. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift—the object's return reweights her isolation with possibility. The cost (lost time) is felt, though the agency in the final beat is more receptive than active, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully through particulars: the compass rose and sketches transform "true north" from a direction to a person waiting "on the other side of silence." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material without statement. Subtext operates in the returned object and Lise's handwritten line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature ("constellations crawl like slow rivers"). Voice is controlled and consistent under pressure, with rhythmic syntax that supports the accumulative, reflective tone. No head-hopping; all elision (e.g., the rescue) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("time pooled and thickened") is precise and voice-motivated. One minor paraphrase loop ("Blessed because... Pariah because...") exists but does not touch the closure beat or obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard SF time dilation with an intimate family tradition is fresh and inevitable. The emotional truth of displacement and the compass rose as a tangible thread are organically integrated. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflective payoff heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
