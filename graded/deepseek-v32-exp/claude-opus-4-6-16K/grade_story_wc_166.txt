<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seraphane's motivation is clear, rooted in her past, and intensifies to the decisive act of tattooing; her interiority is concrete (feeling the garden's "pulse, slow and planetary"). Dorin provides secondary pressure, though his internal conflict is less dramatized. The final stance—"anchoring" from drifting exile to founding—is earned by her agency and carries the cost of ongoing risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear orientation, two-shard structure (past exile, present scene) with a legible transition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she moves from provisional exile to being "spontaneously anchored," founding a resistance. The accumulative/textural lens (patterns of gaps, stars) holds, and cost is legible in the final image of preparing for more arrivals, implying sustained risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the "twilight garden" exists in a surveillance "gap," directly enabling the central action. Micro-settings (the vial, ink, needle) constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Seraphane's professional perception ("tidal patterns").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against erasure) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the act of tattooing is a meaningful tightening that forecloses her anonymity and commits her to a path of resistance. The cost is visible in the use of the last moonstone remnant and the implied ongoing danger as "others were coming."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory as embodied, cosmic resistance emerges organically from concrete actions and imagery (stars, gaps, ink). No moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—exile becomes foundation, memory becomes flesh. Subtext operates powerfully in the celestial inscription as a language beyond erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, distinct single POV with a strong perceptual signature (noticing "gaps," thinking in "tidal patterns"). Lyric compression is taught and legible. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the prose rhythm modulates effectively with the scene's pressure, from meditative to charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and supports the closure. One minor risk: a phrase like "obsidian grace made liquid" borders on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffolding, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory politics, celestial tattooing, and exile. The core concept ("elective exile") is transformed through specific, grounded details (moonstone dust, tide-dancer skills). The turn feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking (lyric compression, quiet climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
