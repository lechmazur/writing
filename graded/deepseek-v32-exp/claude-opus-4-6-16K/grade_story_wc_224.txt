<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vael's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her internal conflict between buried talents and search for home is embodied in concrete actions. The final choice to accept reality is earned by the accidental triggering of her seer gift, with visible cost in the weeping that shakes "foundations no one else could see."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds through descriptive density to a Conceptual Repricing closure where home becomes "finally legible." Cost is legible on-page in the "not restored" realization, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains Vael's search and mirrors her internal state; the stone and feather as micro-settings charge the final image. Sensory details like "air tasted of iron" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) escalates through Vael's agency in finding and activating the stone; cost is unmistakable in the "hidden thunder" of weeping and the foreclosed path of substituted reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of home as syntax emerges through the stone's language seeding into grief-hollowed spaces; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, e.g., "mercury in her eyes stirred," and compression of backstory is interleaved with present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "buried talents returned through the slightest, most accidental touch" is coherent and advances the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of seer, bookstore, and linguistic archaeology feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
