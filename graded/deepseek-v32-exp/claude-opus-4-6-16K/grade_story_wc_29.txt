<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; micro-choices like bribing the guard and transmitting back reveal her values; final endurance of hatred is earned with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is an Earned Stasis with legible cost in "they hated her for it" and the sky's empty silence; orientation is immediate and persistent constraints (charts, frequencies) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like burnt coffee and ionized dust are selective and purposeful; the radio station and astronomical charts constrain choices and charge the final image of the silent sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of humanity's safety escalates through Maren's agency; her interference triggers a decisive change with cost in degraded formulas and social backlash, all under causal linkage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deception and human divisiveness emerges implicitly from events; the ending's resonant image of the sky reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific observation and personal urgency; voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic deception and institutional power plays; specific details like subsonic frequencies and astronomical charts make the premise feel inevitable and organic to character conflict.</comment>
