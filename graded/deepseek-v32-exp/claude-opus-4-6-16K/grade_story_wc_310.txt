<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction (quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt) acts in scene, and her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the line "Stellar doubt pressed against her ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise that lands with cost ("someone had to choose what came next"), the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the contracting universe shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and the coins function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the lens: the change in static bursts forces a tightening, and the cost of doubt is legible on the page, foreclosing the option of surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose in a dying universe, reweighting prior material through the final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, contemplative perceptual signature; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, rhythmic control, and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of backwards prophecy, cast-lots decision-making, and a contracting universe feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in speculative concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
