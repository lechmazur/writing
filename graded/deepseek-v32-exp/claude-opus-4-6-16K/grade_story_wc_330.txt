<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his shift from silence to song is earned, but contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene; the final choice is credible but the visible cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the revaluation of silence; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (the train, the silence); the halo fragment and wind bells charge the final image with tangible atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (silence vs. expression) escalate through protagonist agency; the discovery of the fragment and decision to sing deepen pressure with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action, but the final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("silence, properly attended...") slightly undermines earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; perceptual signature is strong and elision (backstory) is purposeful and anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (isolated artisan, magical object) through specific, grounded details and a risk-taking lyrical mode that heightens stakes.</comment>
