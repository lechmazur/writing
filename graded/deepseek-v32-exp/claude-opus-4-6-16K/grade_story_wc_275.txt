<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's pacifism is embodied through consistent micro-choices (burying the sandbag, redirecting the militia man) and her "marrow-deep" motivation to weave continuity is clear. The young man's shift from aggression to weeping applies secondary pressure, revealing her influence. Interiority is concrete and particular, though her flawlessness edges toward idealization, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds across mosaic shards (tower fall, backstory, burial, survivors, militia man), building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with cost felt in Sera's root-by-root building against violence. Transitions are legible, orientation is immediate, and the pattern is taught by the first shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed rose farm is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice (isolation, fragility, resource). It charges the final image as a "lantern." Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Sera's perception (roses "like living coals," sand, amber light). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving continuity vs. chaos) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens through the arrival of survivors and the militia man's challenge. Sera's agency—her renunciation of violence and steadfast ritual—escalates the conflict and forecloses a path of retaliation with a visible, quiet cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (quiet persistence as defiance) emerges organically through action, image, and subtext (e.g., sheathing the knife). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of "engraved quiet" is integrated into events, and the roses shift from foretellers to the "thread" of continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that reflects Sera's sensibility. Diction and syntax ("senselessly perceptive," "engraved quiet") create a coherent perceptual signature. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext in the exchange with the militia man.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and precise, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("a basin of amber light," "weeping was its own kind of grafting") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with the contemplative mood and brief moments of action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic decay, pacifist philosophy, and plant-based ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept—incultating values in roses—is a specific, non-obvious angle executed with full commitment. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
