<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices like saving coordinates privately reveal her values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with palpable cost in the bleak exhilaration and the geode's reprise; the accumulative lens holds tightly, with time constraint and reflection building to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored and purposefully selective; the geode and observatory constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Nadia's expertise and grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Nadia's agency in the hunt, tightening through discovery and realization; cost is legible in the "bleak exhilaration" that changes nothing about her loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—geode, pools, perturbation theory—with subtext in imagery; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, blending scientific precision with poetic trauma; POV is stable and perceptual signature consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, and clarity remains high even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astrophysics and personal trauma feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
