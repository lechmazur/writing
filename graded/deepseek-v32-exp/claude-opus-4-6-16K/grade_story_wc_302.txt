<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and motivated; Mirenne's cautious exuberance and embodied emotion lead to an earned final choice—removing the veil to write—with visible cost rooted in prior causality and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise (Resonant Reconfiguration) with felt cost in veil removal and letter writing; Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation clear early; persistent constraint of delays shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting glows with sensory specificity; library as micro-setting constrains choice via cipher cycles and charges the final image with brighter glow and mist carrying words, integral to stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens via density of transcription and revelation; protagonist agency with watch and journal leads to stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in veil removal and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words emerges through particulars like veil, watch, and cyclic reversal; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via letter without moralizing; mother's words earn epiphany through scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Mirenne's mindset; rhythm controls pressure; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear with high information density; figurative language precise and purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of library, watch, and veil transforms tropes; concept integrated with character-driven stakes; risk in abstract concepts heightens coherence without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
