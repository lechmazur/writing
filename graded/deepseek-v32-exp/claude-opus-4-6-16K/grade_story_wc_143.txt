<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren is vividly characterized with clear motivation and embodied emotion; her final intervention is earned by prior causality, though lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the lichen's fading and her whispered vigil; orientation is early and clear, structure tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is essential, constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency to intervene chemically, tightening stakes with visible cost; under accumulative lens, density increase reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and ephemerality emerges through particulars without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-impact ecology and human stewardship feels inevitable; specific details like chemical messages and sand grain elevate without gimmickry.</comment>
