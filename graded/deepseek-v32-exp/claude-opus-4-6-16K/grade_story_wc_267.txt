<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deeply embodied, with nerve regeneration mirroring moral awakening. Her final choice to stay, bearing witness, is earned through discovered bloodstains and letters, showing contradictory impulses between safety and duty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details to a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands with cost in the final image of "frostbitten hope" and the weight of letters as "a kind of speaking." Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality tight from injury to discovery to decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress is vividly rendered, with micro-settings like the staircase and piano bench constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's heightened perception. Environment actively pressures tactics and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren's internal conflict between leaving and remembering, escalated through her agency in discovering hidden truths. Cost is legible in her "burning" side and "frostbitten hope," foreclosing escape. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as violence emerges through particulars like bloodstains and letters, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "silence... must answer for what it hides." Subtext operates in gesture and image; epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Maren's interiority. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic modulation. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is effective and coherent, e.g., "silence... something with teeth." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build; clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of a silent order hiding violence is transformed through specific details like nerve regeneration and discovered letters. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
