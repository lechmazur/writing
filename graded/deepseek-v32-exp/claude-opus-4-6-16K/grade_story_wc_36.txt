<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., flute "warm even through the hide"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as building markers and stepping through, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to answer the caller is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtle for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost ("waited for her return"). Causal lens holds tightly: each crossing teaches her, leading to the decisive step. Orientation is anchored early; structure is a single scene with one meaningful tightening. Persistent constraint (silence, markers) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the "avalanchingly quiet" range pressures action; driftwood markers and flute are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "air tasting of copper and rain"). Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting insights from failure) escalates through protagonist agency: eleven crossings culminate in answering the caller. Cost is legible in the final image of waiting silence. Under causal lens, escalation tightens options via accumulated knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—failure as an open door, silence as weight—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hush and the crossing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maret's step and the range's waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and perceptually signature (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet"). Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; purposeful elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high information density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and effective ("silence... like packed snow before the break"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; peak beats are clear and uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific synthesis: relic keeper, world-weaving, and atmospheric silence. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
