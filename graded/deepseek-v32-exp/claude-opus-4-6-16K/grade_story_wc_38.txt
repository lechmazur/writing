<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure; her final decision to delete files is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (the dice pressing like punctuation); causal lens holds tightly from discovery to liberation, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains choice via dance-responsive locks and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from decoding to deletion; cost is legible in the console's hiss and the dice's weight, foreclosing options with defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from encryption as vulnerability-turned-strength; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the completed mother-daughter dance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature (e.g., "reading the Braille of decay") and rhythmic control under pressure are consistent and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("like a hymn holds a congregation") is coherent and serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of a lyrical code breaker dancing through a sunken lab is fresh and specific; synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in tone and structure heightening stakes.</comment>
