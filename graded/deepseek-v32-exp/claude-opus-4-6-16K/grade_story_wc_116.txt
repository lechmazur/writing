<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character is vividly embodied with concrete interiority and consistent micro-choices, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, capping at 8.8 per 9+ quick test. Final renunciation (writing nothing) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost ("peace was already crumbling"). Orientation clear early, persistent constraint (swan/silence) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and sensory; the obsidian refuge charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Environment functions as micro-setting that reweights silence and regeneration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens via density increase; protagonist's agency (using swan, sitting in silence) drives deepening. Cost is legible in crumbling peace and foreclosed path of recording.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through particulars without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer (memory as enough) that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistently lyrical and filtered through keeper's consciousness. No head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear; sentence-level rhythm supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable; chronicle keeper and origami swan are fresh inflections on familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
