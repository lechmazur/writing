<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in history, with embodied emotion in her stitching and listening. However, internal conflict is more told than shown in scene, limiting peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise: the signal sent and needle resumed, cost legible in mother's erasure. Accumulative lens holds tightly, with observatory architecture as persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: cobalt observatory's sound channels and eternal candle constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maren's agency—listening, stitching, synchronizing—with visible cost in the impending coup and her silent documentation. One meaningful tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges through concrete particulars: embroidery as conspiracy map, mother's erasure. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with lyrical precision reflecting Maren's perception. POV is stable and purposefully compressed, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of embroidery, conspiracy, and observatory feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
