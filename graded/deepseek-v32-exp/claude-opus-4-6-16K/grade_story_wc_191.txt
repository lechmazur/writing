<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Senna's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her trait "wisely adventurous" is demonstrated through planning and action. Interiority is concrete (e.g., feeling the paint texture shift). However, internal contradiction is minimal—she is steadfast, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate the score to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat logically follows the last, driven by Senna's goal and the sunrise deadline. Closure is a decisive change (sitting on the throne) with clear cost (the orchard sealing behind her). The time constraint persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting—orchard, waterfall, throne chamber—is vividly specific and critically constrains choice (the sealing entrance, the map in the bark). It charges the final image and is seamlessly woven into action and perception, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claiming the throne) escalates cleanly under the causal lens via the time pressure and discovery beats. Senna's agency drives each turn; cost is legible as the orchard seals at dawn. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of power, legacy, and responsibility emerges organically from the quest and the warning "The throne does not want you." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Some complexity but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Senna's professional, observant consciousness. Voice is distinct and consistent, with a rhythmic, slightly archaic texture that suits the speculative setting. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with strong rhythmic control and no scaffolding loops. Figurative language ("vanished like signal static") is purposeful. Minor purple tinge in a few phrases prevents a perfect score, but clarity and propulsion are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic quest with high-tech ruins feels fresh and specific. Details like the prismatic waterfall and data-glass ruby flake are imaginative and integral. While the structure is classic, the worldbuilding and execution transform it.</comment>
