<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's contradictory impulses (elusiveness vs. latent desire for connection) are embodied in micro-choices like laughing at the moon rock then writing back. Her final stance—allowing the web of reciprocities—is earned by the causal chain of exchanges and visits, with the cost of vulnerability legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; the moon rock's arrival triggers a series of voluntary exchanges that reconfigure Marta's isolation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the "lighthouse" image, which reweights the station and the rock's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ivy‑swallowed station functions as both refuge and crucible, constraining Marta's initial hiding and later enabling communal gathering. The moon rock, a micro‑setting object, charges the final image decisively, its borrowed light reconfiguring the space’s purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness vs. connection) escalates through Marta’s agency: writing the first reply, continuing exchanges, welcoming visitors. Each step tightens her commitment to reciprocity, with the cost of openness legible when she places the rock on the windowsill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete exchanges and the ivy/moon‑rock motifs, but the explicit realization about “the cure for loneliness” slightly moralizes. The final image, however, offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights the preceding material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and filtered through Marta’s logistical, jocular voice. Perceptual signature is distinct (noticing “line items,” “spreadsheet”), and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, even in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“tendril by tendril,” “lighthouse made of borrowed light”) is sharp and purposeful, accelerating toward the closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of disaster‑relief precision with cosmic absurdity feels inevitable in hindsight. The moon‑rock catalyst and the station’s transformation are specific, irreplaceable risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
