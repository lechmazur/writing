<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Edwin's "mournfully eager" desperation is embodied in specific actions like the taped pull cords, and his decision to keep singing when Bea appears reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown through his grief-driven yet hopeful conduct, and the final laugh is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concretely filtered through sound and touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Bea's laugh) with felt cost in the fading resonance; causal lens holds tightly from Edwin's actions to outcome. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tunnel's persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending lands on-page with an exact image of cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tunnel as echo chamber constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail like "granular sound" and "cold concrete" filtered through Edwin's priorities. Micro-setting (leaf blowers, concrete) is indispensable for the climax. Atmosphere mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring laughter) escalates via Edwin's agency under the causal lens: deadline urgency, performance, and his choice to keep singing. A single meaningful tightening occurs when Bea appears, forcing a stance crystallization with cost legible in her "harder-won" laugh. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken grief engineered into sound emerges from particulars like the father's notebooks and macerated lullabies, without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and echo; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the laugh's echo. No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on acoustics and grief. Voice is lyrical yet controlled ("sound macerated her careful composure"); rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("chewing melody into particles") is precise and heightens clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the leaf blowers' roar and decelerates at closure. No artifacts touch the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes leaf blowers, acoustic engineering, and grief into a non-obvious, organic whole. Risk-taking in method heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to its conceit.</comment>
