<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's skepticism and eventual emotional rupture are embodied through concrete micro-choices (the lie, the notebook entry) with visible cost. Sera's grounded mysticism is shown, not told, via jacket, boots, and prism. The sudden flood of borrowed grief feels earned by the frost's movement and the prism's established weight, though the narrator's internal shift is rapid—a hairline slip that does not break closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density until the "shifted hush" and frost reorganization trigger a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost—the unbearable conclusion that "everything we have ever touched remembers." Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and mist create a charged atmosphere, but the micro-setting—the frost on the car window—is indispensable. It constrains the action (the communion method) and directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the narrator's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belief vs. evidence) escalates through the accumulative pressure of the experiment. The protagonist's agency—the decision to lie and write "inconclusive"—forecloses acceptance with a felt cost. The climax, though supernatural, is prepared by Sera's established research and the narrator's mounting unease.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely from particulars—the prism, the frost patterns, the transmitted grief—without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise: the world is saturated with unlistened-to emotion. Subtext operates through the "truthful lie" and the final, charged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends skepticism and lyrical observation. Voice modulates under pressure ("the sorrow... was not mine") without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven. Purposeful compression (the backstory block) is anchored in the present prism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("mist clung like grief") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Information density is high; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise—objects literally absorbing emotions—is fresh and executed with rigorous specificity. The synthesis of quartz arbor, frost patterns, and grief-transmission feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric intensity, supernatural climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
