<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in defiance; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "Defiance worked better"). Micro-choices under pressure, like cleaning the mosaic and copying the formula, reveal her values. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene, and the cost, while implied, is not starkly visible, keeping it below the 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; drive lens (Hybrid, Accumulative dominant) holds through closure with a Charged Poise. The closure lands on-page with felt cost in Maren's determination and future struggles ("she would build the formula wrong three times"). Persistent constraint of hopelessness shapes tactics, and the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Maren's POV, with sensory detail (wisteria, jasmine, mineral tang) that charges the final image. The fortress and mosaic constrain her search, and the kerosene rag knot functions as a micro-setting that enables key actions. Environment actively shapes choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Maren's agency in searching and finding the mosaic, tightening options. Cost is legible in her projected failures and persistence, but not heavily on-page. One meaningful pressure point suffices for this length under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of creating light against darkness emerges organically from events and images (fireworks, starless night). Subtext operates through gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of carrying her own light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and rhythmic, reflecting Maren's profession and mindset. No head-hopping; diction and syntax are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., chanting as sonar) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("petals drifting down like soft ammunition") is effective and consistent. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wandering fireworks designer, mosaic formula, and starless night feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical focus heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Details are specific and organic, transforming familiar tropes through character and setting.</comment>
