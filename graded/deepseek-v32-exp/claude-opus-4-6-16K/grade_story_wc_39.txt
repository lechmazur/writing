<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and rooted in poignant backstory, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the scene lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his determination is single-minded, which limits the interior complexity required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Milo steps out carrying the composite sound as a lantern between generations. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of scavenged technology shapes his tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The feral loft, dunes, and jars are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Milo's poetic perception, fully integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving and bridging voices) escalate through Milo's agency: finding the music box, recording the composite sound at dawn, and deciding to share it. A meaningful tightening occurs with the creation of the composite jar, and cost is legible in his trembling hands and the weight of the offering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges organically through concrete particulars—jars, music box, dawn recording—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Slight explicit statement in the "gleaned redemption" paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, voice distinctively poetic and reflective, with a consistent perceptual signature. Lyrical compression is taught and pays off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats, without obscuring clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of vagrant poet, sound-jarring, and redemptive mosaic. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative plot that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
