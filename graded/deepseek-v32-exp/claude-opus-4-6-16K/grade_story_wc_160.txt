<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her trembling hands and throat tightening show emotion under pressure. The final choice to follow Elias's path is earned by the causal discovery of encoded compassion, with visible cost in her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage from envelope to chain to adhesive analysis drives the plot; closure lands with Maren's decision to adjust the gates, cost legible in her shaking hands. The lens holds, and persistent constraints (chain, envelope) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the breathing amphitheater and workshop filter through Maren's perception. The surveyor's chain constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency: each discovery narrows options toward her decision. The stake between consortium and villages tightens, with cost clear in the risk she undertakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of engineered compassion emerges from particulars without moralizing. The final image of tools and envelope offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice has a perceptual signature tuned to Maren's profession and inner state. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no artifacts. Figurative language like "cracks widened and narrowed like the lines on an old face" is precise and enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of technical precision and moral compassion feels inevitable. The quiet risk of encoded mercy transforms a familiar trope into a fresh, specific story.</comment>
