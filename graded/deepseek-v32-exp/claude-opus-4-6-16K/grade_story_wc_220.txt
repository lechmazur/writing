<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion (weeping at “come”) and micro-choices (borrowing a lens, mapping grooves) that reveal her desperation. The final choice to leave is earned by her decoding process and her longing, with visible cost in leaving Grieve. Her contradictory impulses—terror of the dead versus longing for the living—are dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise (she walks east) with felt cost (leaving safety for the wasteland). Orientation is clear early. The decoding process builds causally to the decision; the persistent constraint of no phonograph shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (scrapyard Grieve, cracked wasteland) is vivid, sensory, and pressures choices (no phonograph, copper dust). The environment constrains her decoding and charges the final image of walking east. Micro-setting (cylinder, leaf) functions as terrain and emotional anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnecting with Ada) escalates through Maren’s agency in decoding; each fragment tightens her resolve. Cost is legible in her departure into the wasteland. Under the accumulative lens, density increases as she decodes, reweighting the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (translation of distance into closeness) emerges through concrete particulars (grooves as terrain, leaf as preserved memory). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shifting from finding bodies to finding a living voice. Subtext operates in image and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (tracker’s eye for terrain applied to grooves). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. No dialogue; prose reflects Maren’s professional bias and longing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“grooves were a terrain”) is purposeful and consistent. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: post-apocalyptic tracker decoding a phonograph cylinder as terrain. The concept feels inevitable, grounded in character-specific detail. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through specific lived detail.</comment>
