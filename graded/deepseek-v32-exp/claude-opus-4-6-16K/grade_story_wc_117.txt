<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—professional patience tasting like helplessness—acts in scene, and Wren's cautious reconnection is earned through the eclipse's sensory pressure. The final choice to play again emerges from Wren's embodied micro-choice of linking pulse to music, with visible cost in the rough whisper. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific, concrete perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pressure builds through sensory thinning and the eclipse's arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Wren whispers and requests song. Cost is legible on-page in "the word came out rough and unused." Orientation is immediate and pattern-taught; closure unit lands with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the ridge, sage, and "dreaming roots" constrain the choice of location and charge the final image where roots "held the ridge steady." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (light "pewter and ancient," temperature drop "as if the mountain had inhaled"). Micro-setting (the guitar, the locket) actively shapes the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive intensification via the eclipse's totality, which forces Wren's stance crystallization. Agency is Elara's choice to bring Wren and play; Wren's active linking of pulse to music deepens the stake. Cost is felt in the rough whisper and the "cautious and exuberant" face—a trade-off between wonder and vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges entirely through particulars—the locket, the open-tuned guitar, the eclipse—and is reweighted at the end without statement. The final image (the girl singing along, the door left open) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture (Wren pressing ear to forearm) and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—lyric but controlled, with a professional therapist's observational specificity ("softly adaptive," "silence decided to hum back"). POV is stable third-person close to Elara; psychic distance tightens at peak beats. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven ("Play again?"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor overwriting in a few phrases ("the world still smelled like milk and possibility" edges toward decorative). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere. A single decorative flourish prevents a 9+ but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of music therapy, eclipse, and selective mutism feels fresh and specific. Tropes (healing through nature) are transformed through grounded, sensory particulars and a non-obvious moral calculus—the resolution is tentative, not miraculous. The closure image is earned and inevitable in hindsight, though the core premise is familiar elevated by execution.</comment>
