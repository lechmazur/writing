<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her professional expertise and recent inspiration. Her decision to stay in the flood is a micro-choice that reveals her values, and the final act of playing and carrying the opera out is earned by prior causality. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the emotional cost, while present, is not deeply embodied under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren completes the opera and receives the thank-you; cost is legible in the fading image and her memorization. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern of hidden score and architectural echo tightening to a cadence shift. Orientation is immediate, and the water damage mechanic is plausibly integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the flooded pit forces wading, lantern light guides discovery, and the architecture itself resonates with the music. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image of the wordless conversation. The environment constrains tactics and shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling the ghost's code) is signaled early and escalates through Maren's agency as she finds the program and plays. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases with the water-revealed score, leading to a decisive cadence shift. Cost is visible in her endurance and the transient thank-you, but the price lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of artistic legacy across time emerges organically through concrete particulars: the water-damaged program, the architectural echoes, the final thank-you. Subtext operates in image and implication, with no moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior fragments without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Maren's musical perception; voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the accumulating silence and sound. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct in noticing acoustic geometry and hidden traces. Elision (e.g., "in between spaces") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative language ("masts of drowned ships") is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or overwriting; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Line-level craft supports the closure image without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes architectural ghost, water-reactive ink, and musical resonance into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Details are specific and irreplaceable (Karelian Opera House, Elara Voss). Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
