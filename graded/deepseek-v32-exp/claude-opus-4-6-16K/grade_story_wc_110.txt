<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's internal conflict between institutional suspicion and personal curiosity is embodied in micro-choices; her final decision to record Jonah's testimony is earned by the lens examination and carries visible professional cost. The slight explicit realization in the final paragraph ("freed by honesty") is a minor tell but does not undercut the embodied choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (Maren's ledger entry) with resonant reconfiguration (the hushed mutual belief), and cost is legible in her act of signing. The tickets and lens form a coherent causal chain without gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The forecourt’s crystalline hum and rain-soaked details charge the final image and mirror the thematic clarity; the projector lens as a key object constrains choice by being the tangible proof Maren must evaluate. Sensory selection is filtered through Maren’s registrar precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust vs. institutional truth) escalates through Maren’s agency: she decodes the doodles, meets Jonah, tests the lens, and commits to the record. The tightening forecloses her earlier suspicion with a visible cost—her professional endorsement of his testimony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and transparency emerges through concrete actions (doodles, lens, ledger) rather than statement, though the final paragraph’s explicit summary (“freed by honesty”) slightly dilutes the subtext. The ending image of the whispering crystals offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, observant voice that reflects Maren’s registrar mindset. Dialogue is spare but natural; psychic distance shifts intentionally to deepen intimacy during Jonah’s confession. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with no scaffold or loops. Figurative language (“a day that had exhausted all its arguments”) is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance character and atmosphere without ornament; peak beats remain uncluttered by mixed metaphors or filter verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a bureaucratic mystery with a crystalline, almost magical setting; the doodle code and projector lens transform a familiar theme of trust into a specific, inevitable arc. Risk-taking in the hushed, atmospheric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
