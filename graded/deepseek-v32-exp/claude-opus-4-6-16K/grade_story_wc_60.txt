<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's "luminous skepticism" is a consistent, character-particular trait that fuels her investigation and final nuanced stance. Micro-choices (mapping tiles, patiently unsticking the box) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance (turning to map the next fountain) is a credible Earned Stasis, though the felt cost of her transformed doubt is more conceptual than viscerally embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as doubt and reverence crystallize. Causality is tight from geese's pause to box's opening. Cost is legible in the final reconfiguration of her stance: "the willingness to look without flinching." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The city's "defiant hush" and dry fountains create coherent atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's POV ("smelled of rust and dried moss"). The stained glass box functions as a crucial micro-setting object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive deepening: following the breadcrumb path culminates in the act of unsticking the box, which reweights the dominant stake (doubt vs. truth) with cost. Agency is clear; the price is the conceptual reconfiguration of her skepticism into reverence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (doubt as a form of reverence, patience as a method of discovery) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the breadcrumbs, the box, the released memories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of her continued mapping, "the patience of stars." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature ("a Tuesday that smelled of rust") that remains controlled under pressure. The prose's rhythmic, accumulative quality perfectly serves the Textural drive lens. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. One minor strain: "something between acoustics and mineral chemistry" leans slightly toward explanatory summary in a peak beat, but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a luminous skeptic methodically navigating a mythic city via astronomical breadcrumbs—is fresh, specific, and non-obvious. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded character choice. The lyrical risk heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky.</comment>
