<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and embodied; her determination to weave despite uncertainty is earned, and the final reunion carries the cost of years of silent work. Her grief and purpose act simultaneously, and her micro-choices (collecting beads, fitting jigsaw pieces) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Sable weaves and sends out tapestry pieces, Lien receives one and returns. Closure is a decisive change (reunion) with felt cost (years of separation and weaving). Orientation is clear within 120 words; mosaic structure with shards is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the bamboo forest supplies materials and isolation, the orchard provides amber beads. The environment charges the final image (bamboo knocking its hollow music) and shapes Sable's tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching Lien) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Sable's agency (shifting from letters to weaving). The cost—years of daily expenditure on a task with no guarantee of success—is unmistakable on the page and tightens the emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and communication emerges through images (raveling silence, amber beads, jigsaw tapestry) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the silence becomes complete through reunion, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Sable's lyrical, specific voice. The narrative stance remains consistent, with rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., bamboo language she almost understands).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; sentences vary in rhythm and length, accelerating or breathing with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (jigsaw weaving, amber beads, raveling silence) feels organic and inevitable. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
