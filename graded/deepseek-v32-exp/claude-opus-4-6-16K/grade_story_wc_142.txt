<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's dual allegiance and motivation are clear, rooted in concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and her final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, the internal conflict is more summarized than simultaneously acting in scene, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the Flotilla deciding what it wants to be, with cost legible in the gentrification threat and the unsteady, alive rocking. Causal lens holds tightly from reorganization efforts to the counteroffer, and the 60-day deadline provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Flotilla is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail that pressures choices and charges the final image. The foundation stone chip, as a recurring object, constrains action and seals the mural, integrating setting and object into the narrative's core conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the Flotilla's soul vs. privatization) is signaled early and tightens via Maren's agency: the charter gains signatories, narrowing options. Cost is visible in the encroaching gentrification and the uncertain future, though the escalation is a step forward rather than a major reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of community vs. commercialization emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the Flotilla "deciding what it wanted to be," reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature filtered through Maren's consciousness. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., the graffiti codes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and consistent, enhancing clarity and atmosphere. Sentence-level craft supports the story's momentum and closure image seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating city, gentrification, and encoded graffiti art feels organic and fresh. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and character-driven stakes, resulting in a story that is both original and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
