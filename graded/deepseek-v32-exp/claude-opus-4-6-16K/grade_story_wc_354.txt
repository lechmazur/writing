<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s characterization is precise and consistent; her chess-tutor past informs her methodical attention, and her final choice to stay as listener is earned by prior causality. The exile and loneliness carry cost, though the realization moment lacks internal contradiction, slightly smoothing the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens. The cost is legible in the transformed exile and the warm stone. Orientation is immediate; the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and worry stone are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through Maren’s perception, elevating stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew covenant before lunar phase) tightens via Maren’s agency—her intentional declaration escalates pressure. Cost is felt in her exile and the quiet transformation of her purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence, absence, and attention; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the gaps and the worry stone’s evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third‑person limited with a distinct lyrical, precise voice that mirrors Maren’s perception. No head‑hopping; rhythm and diction control heighten the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmic without artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence variety supports momentum. No loops or scaffold obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of covenant, chess strategy, and language of absence. The quiet, internal climax is a risk that pays off, transforming familiar tropes through specific character and setting.</comment>
