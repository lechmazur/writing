<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her memory-tasting ability and quiet rebellion. Interiority is concrete (e.g., trembling hands, tasting memories). Micro-choices under pressure (pruning, harvesting) reveal her values. The final certainty is earned by prior cultivation, but interior contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (risk, effort). The once-in-12-millennia alignment tightens pressure. Orientation is clear early. The ending reconfigures meaning with "beauty was the one language power could never fully outlaw."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly specific and constrains choice (light through broken panels). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maren's perception. The setting charges the final image of the skeleton against the sky, essential to the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring hunger for knowledge) escalates through celestial timing and pruning decisions. Agency drives the ripening and harvest. Cost is legible in the secret cultivation and the risk of Ministry discovery. Tightening is meaningful under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gentle rebellion and beauty in ruins emerges through concrete images (fruit, soup, greenhouse). Subtext operates in memory tastes and quiet acts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Integration is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, sensory voice tied to Maren's memory-tasting. Perceptual signature is strong. No head-hopping. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and peak beats are sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting, dystopian botany, and celestial event feels organic and inevitable. The gentle rebellion angle transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical closure pays off with originality and specificity.</comment>
