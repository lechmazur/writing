<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Adaeze's internal contradiction—diaspora hollowness versus warmly curious engagement—drives every micro-choice; her final offering of kola nut and broken Igbo is earned by prior discoveries and carries the cost of years lost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the image of "the first green thread of a root," reweighting her journey with the undeniable conceptual cost of interruption and return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, not backdrop: roots and bones constrain movement, supply the sundial base, and charge the final image with the persistent tension between decay and growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes of lost faith escalate via accumulative density—each discovery of interrupted journeys deepens her understanding; her agency in rebuilding and offering the kola nut carries a felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges entirely through concrete particulars (sundial symbols, half-anointed bones, root geometry) and resolves in a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV maintains a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, archaeologically attentive—with no head-hopping; diction and rhythm modulate with her emotional intensity, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; the final paragraph's "first green thread" image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of archaeology, diaspora return, and cultural memory; specific details (Nsibidi symbols, kola nut, root-wrapped bones) ground the concept, and the quiet, introspective risk heightens stakes.</comment>
