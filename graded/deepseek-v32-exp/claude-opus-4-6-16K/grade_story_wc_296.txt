<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's guarded nature and motivation are concretely embodied; her internal shift from clenched to unbent is earned through the journey, with visible cost in the final image of her staff held loosely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages are tight from failed magic to vortex navigation; closure lands with a decisive change as confessions dissolve and Maren finds permission to stop searching, cost legible in the unbending of her "fist she had mistaken for her spine."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard vortex is visceral and constraining, shaping Maren's tactics via the flesh-eating vine; its evolution from "warlike serenity" to stilled lake charges the final reflection image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what mirrors don't show) escalates through Maren's agency—seed throw, circle navigation, confrontation with mother's voice—culminating in the cost of unbending and the vortex's calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of searching and release emerges through frozen confessions and the mother's secret; the ending's "permission to stop searching" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a lyrical, perceptual signature; Maren's guarded observation colors every image, and the mother's voice carries subtext without disrupting focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with no scaffolds or loops; figurative language ("snapping tendons," "pupil of some vast, patient eye") is consistent and heightens pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic magic, frozen confessions, and psychological quest; the concept of a vortex archive of guilt transforms familiar tropes through specific, inevitable choices.</comment>
