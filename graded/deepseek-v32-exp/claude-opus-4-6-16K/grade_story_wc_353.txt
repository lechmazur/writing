<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied and specific (e.g., "symphonies blooming in her mind"). Final choice to strum is earned by prior causality—analysis, instrument crafting—with visible cost in her perseverance. Contradictory impulses (inner sound vs. outer silence) drive the arc, though the internal conflict is more sustained than scene-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost: sound gradually returns, siskins sing, and the world is "reclaiming" through fragile effort. Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building density through sensory patterns. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight from discovery to anti-frequency instrument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice (the Quiet forces inventive tactics) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—e.g., "tiny throats pulsed with song that produced nothing." The alder grove and porcelain insulator are micro-settings that shape the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (create music) escalates through Maren's agency: finding sculpture, analyzing cracks, crafting instrument, strumming. Cost is legible in her sustained effort and the gradual, fragile return of sound. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—silence, art, empathy—without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "crack by crack reclaiming a world that had forgotten what it meant to listen." Subtext operates in images like the siskin tilting its head.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptual signature (e.g., "stress cracks... trained her eyes to see"). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and vivid ("sound... thin as spider silk"). No artifacts to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific—silent world, tree-song sculptor, stress-crack acoustics—synthesized into an inevitable arc. Risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation through lived detail avoids derivative templates.</comment>
