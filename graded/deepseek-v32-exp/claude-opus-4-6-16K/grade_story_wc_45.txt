<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction (skepticism/yearning) is embodied in concrete action; her final choice to follow the child is earned by the prior cleft in certainty and her bone-setter's desire to mend, with cost legible in the reconfigured path home. The changeling child's shrewd innocence provides a secondary pressure that tests Maren's forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the maze rearranges and the path home becomes "something new." Causal linkages (tooth→yearn→maze→child→decision) are tight under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Maren's professional perception; the garden's "nostalgic innovation" and the maze that "rearranged itself" charge the final image. The tooth and bone-setting details act as micro-settings that constrain choice and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/healing) escalates from discovery to yearning to active pursuit; the child's condition ("forgive what you find") tightens options. Maren's agency in following the child forecloses her old certainty with a felt cost under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending between worlds emerges through specific metaphor (bone-setting, constellations) without statement. The final image of "oldest mistakes grew into light" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness and belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct: a bone-setter's tactile, precise perception governs syntax and imagery. Dialogue is sparse but natural; the child's speech carries subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity; figurative language ("calcified grief," "slow breathing" moss) is purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm varies with emotional pressure, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling myth with bone-setting and a skeptic's arc feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression and a quiet, charged poise ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in detail (enamel tooth, elderwood) anchors originality.</comment>
