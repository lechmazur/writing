<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interior contradiction (fear vs. action) is embodied, and her final choice to write her own words is earned with visible cost, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands on-page with cost in "It mattered." Orientation is anchored early, and the magnetic grotto installation acts as a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vivid, purpose-driven settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Maren's rebellion escalates from individual displays to the grotto installation, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in her personal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words and second thoughts emerges through concrete events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the grotto scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organically synthesized; the humble rebellion concept and specific details (e.g., window displays, magnetic grotto) heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
