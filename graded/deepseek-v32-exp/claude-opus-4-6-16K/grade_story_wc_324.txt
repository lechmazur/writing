<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lenora's curiosity is embodied through specific actions and micro-choices; her final decision to hold on is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost. Internal contradiction between duty and curiosity drives the scene without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkage; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost of incidental heroism is legible in "did not let go until the woman's breathing steadied." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (mist-clad atrium) and tool (hearing aid) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "fog pooled between marble columns" are selective and filtered through Lenora's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) escalates under causal lens via Lenora's agency to assure the woman; cost is unmistakable in the woman's sobbing and Lenora's sustained presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism emerges organically from concrete actions and the final image; subtext operates in gesture and silence, with a resonant, non-literal answer in "protecting this one vulnerable voice was enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "like breath held too long." Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("bled copper through suspended water droplets") is precise and supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is transformed through specific, grounded details; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
