<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's amoral calculus and vestigial sentiment are concretely embodied; her final choice to leave the egg and speaker is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the emotional sting and lasting echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the call following her and the erased map, all anchored by early orientation and persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The salt flat and cracks function as micro-setting that directly constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from drought to release; cost is unmistakable in displaced suffering and her emotional trade-off at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the egg and cracks; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the call following her, reweighting morality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, precise voice modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., drought mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero loops; figurative language ("cartography of thirst") enhances without muddling peak beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in moral calculus heightens stakes, and the transformation feels inevitable through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
