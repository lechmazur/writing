<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s defiance is concrete and consistent, driving her prepared action and final stance. Her interiority is vivid but lacks contradictory impulses, which prevents the highest band. The final choice (waiting unafraid) is earned by prior causality with visible cost (memory loss).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Lira’s goal (preserve truth) leads to her echo tactic, which reconfigures the stakes. Closure is a charged poise with legible cost (she will forget, but the canyon remembers). The persistent constraint of the canyon’s acoustics shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bone towers and echoing canyon are indispensable, constraining Lira’s method and charging the final image. Sensory details (mist, sound) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her artistic perception. Setting is fully integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth’s survival) escalates through Lira’s agency: she uses the canyon to refract her testimony. The confrontation tightens options, and the cost (her memory) is unmistakable on the page. Pressure coheres and deepens under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as amputation emerges through concrete events and images. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: the canyon remembers, making truth plural and unerasable. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third‑person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, perceptive voice that matches Lira’s artistry. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; dialogue (brief) is natural and goal‑driven. No head‑hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with zero scaffolding or loops. Sentence‑level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (defiant artist, memory erasure) through specific, irreplaceable details (bone‑canyon acoustics, impromptu poetry). The core premise is transformed, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
