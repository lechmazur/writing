<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and embodied; her proprioceptive enhancement transforms suffering into geometry, and her motivation to invert the algorithm is rooted in consistent trauma-response mechanics. The final endurance—writing through the night—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise: "She braced her hand against the earth and kept writing," reconfiguring mercy as a theorem with conceptual cost. Causal-hybrid lens holds; orientation is anchored within 120 words (anesthesia, violet forest, surgical site). One meaningful tightening from waking to active equation-writing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is vividly sensory and charges the final image like a "cathedral of penance." Micro-setting (the earth where equations are written) and recurring object (pewter strap) constrain choice and amplify theme. Details are filtered through Maren's enhanced perception, avoiding exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the mathematics of mercy) is signaled early and escalates via Maren's agency: using trauma responses to extract coordinates. Pressure tightens as memories surface; cost is legible in "converting every wound into a coordinate." One meaningful deepening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: suffering transformed into irrefutable knowledge. Subtext in the pewter strap and ultraviolet bruise-like beauty; no moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—mercy as a theorem belonging to the oppressed—reweighting prior pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature: enhanced proprioception filters description into geometric precision. Voice is controlled and lyrical ("pain wore off in layers"); no head-hopping. Elision (trauma responses as doorway) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("color born from damage") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, especially in peak beats like the final equation-writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of enhanced interrogation, proprioceptive geometry, and mathematical inversion of mercy. Tropes are transformed through specific lived detail (pewter strap, ultraviolet forest). Feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
