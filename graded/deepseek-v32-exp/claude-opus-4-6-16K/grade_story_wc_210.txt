<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her rejection of false comfort; her final choice to begin rebuilding is earned by her discovery and use of the bottle. The cost of forgoing easy miracles is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise with clear cost; the accumulative lens holds as details of loss and memory build to her decision. The sealed bottle as a constraint shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reimagination from old bones emerges through concrete images; the ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; third-person limited POV filters the world through Maren's alchemical perspective with rhythmic control.</comment>
