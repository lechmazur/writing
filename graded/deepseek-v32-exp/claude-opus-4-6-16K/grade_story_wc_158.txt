<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren is vividly realized with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; her centuries of insomnia and poetic compulsion are consistent, and her final choice to sleep is earned by the postcard's news, with visible cost in her longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accumulative lens builds to a resonant reconfiguration; the postcard arrival incites a decisive change, and the closure (sleep) lands with felt cost; structure is tight and causality clear, with the shell’s constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is rendered with sensory specificity and functions as both constraint and comfort; it charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (longing vs. peace) escalates through the postcard's message; Maren's agency in writing "bloom" and sleeping forecloses her prior path with a cost that is legible and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges through particulars (postcard, shell, poems); the ending offers a non‑literal, resonant answer without moralizing, and subtext about peace and blooming is richly layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third‑person limited POV with a distinct poetic perceptual signature; the lyrical voice is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, and there is no head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally controlled prose with high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of an insomniac poet in a shell and the blossom armistice is fresh and organic; the synthesis of mythical and lyrical elements feels inevitable, and risk‑taking enhances stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
