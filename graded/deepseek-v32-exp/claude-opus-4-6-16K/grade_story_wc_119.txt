<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation is clear and rooted in her prophetic gift; her endurance at the lighthouse feels earned with visible cost of isolation, and her internal conflict between hiding and writing is embodied throughout without diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; accumulative/textural lens builds through resonant patterns of fortunes and light; closure reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost legible in the final image of waiting fortunes and the pulsing beam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the lighthouse and island imposing isolation; the beam and fortunes act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the closure with resonant specificity, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; pressure escalates through investigations and her enduring compulsion, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in her isolated existence and the unease her fortunes propagate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and accidental prophecy is woven through concrete particulars; subtext operates in the beam-fortune parallel; closure reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is tightly focused on Mei Lin; voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual bias toward patterns and implications; prose rhythm supports the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional; sentences are precise and evocative with high information density; rhythm varies naturally; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized; the fusion of mundane prophecy and remote guardianship feels inevitable and rich; specific details anchor universal themes without gimmickry, heightening stakes.</comment>
