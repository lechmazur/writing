<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harsk's grief and motivation are embodied in concrete, particular interiority (e.g., "His mind at night was a clean, dark room"). The final micro-choice—holding still to preserve an echo—is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The dreamless state and daughter's loss create a credible, flawed endurance that forecloses a path with felt emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Harsk's preservation of an "almost-moment" reweights the stakes with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The pattern of reflective shards is taught early and pays off in the final image, making the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, sensory, and filtered through Harsk's POV. The glowing dune and chess clock charge the final image and constrain choice (the clock's frozen state dictates his method of "holding still"). Micro-setting (the dune's flowers) supplies the resonant "fractured lullaby" that enables the archive access.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift as Harsk listens and successfully captures an echo. The dominant stake (preserving lost possibilities) tightens through his agency—the renunciation of "reaching" forecloses a path with visible cost. The pressure coheres and deepens to the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: loss, memory, and the preservation of "almosts." The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the preserved echo and the ongoing search for sparks. Subtext is rich in the chess clock and archive concept, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical and elegiac voice. Perceptual signature is strong—Harsk’s noticing is selective and character‑specific. Syntax and rhythm reflect his state; purposeful compression (e.g., "He did not reach for it. Reaching collapsed the wrong things.") heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "The echo settled into the sand like rain into dry earth"). Line‑level craft supports the closure image without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post‑apocalyptic setting, quantum‑like archive work, and intimate grief is fresh and non‑obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity are fully realized.</comment>
