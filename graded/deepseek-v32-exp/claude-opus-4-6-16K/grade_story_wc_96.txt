<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is rich with interior contradiction (monthly selves, fury/weeping/couplets), embodied emotion, and micro-choices under pressure (hiding poems, starting readings). Her final stance—awaiting the next self—is an earned endurance, a "rebuild" reframed through Jonah's influence, with visible cost in perpetual fracture. No diagnostic label-speak; motivation (forging beauty from anarchy) intensifies credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: pattern of molting and resistance deepens via shards (library discovery, prison meeting, public readings). Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren awaits August's self "already blooming, already fractured"—reconfiguring meaning with felt cost of ongoing transformation. Orientation is clear early; transitions are legible; the mosaic structure (Track B) is taught and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rusted library is a vivid, pressure-inducing setting that constrains choice (home, stage). The coffee tin as micro-setting charges the final image and climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("skeletal beams that framed constellations like iron verses"). POV filters all description; spatial choreography is clean. The object-as-setting qualifies for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in disorder) escalates under the accumulative lens via density increase: from private documentation to public sharing to opening the archive. Agency is clear in Maren's choice to read every self, a deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the vulnerability and acceptance of perpetual fracture. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges seamlessly from events: disorder as wildest meaning, resistance as blooming. Subtext operates in gesture and image (coffee tin's false bottom, "cathedral out of broken windows"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of awaiting the next self. No moralizing; thematic resonance arises from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("vagrant penny poet whose currency was language"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains coherent. Dialogue (with Jonah) is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and legible. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control ("already composing the poem she would write in a stranger's handwriting, already blooming, already fractured, already luminous"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs. Read-aloud ear test passes; clarity and concision are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transformation, resistance, and beauty in disorder feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded choices (monthly molting, coffee tin archive, prison library friendship) avoid template plots. Risk-taking in mosaic structure and lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Authentic vision coheres.</comment>
