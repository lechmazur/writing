<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and character-particular, blending engineering mindset with poetic hope ("equations for hope"). Her motivation intensifies under pressure, culminating in the proposal. The final Charged Poise is earned by prior causality, though the cost—while felt—is somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in a micro-choice at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative), dominant at closure is Causal. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a valid Charged Poise with felt cost in the waiting ("an open corridor in the maze"). The sextant's constraint and the feasibility study outcome shape tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is not merely backdrop; it directly pressures Sable's choices and supplies the key discovery (redirected flows). The sextant piece, a micro-setting object, charges the final image and constrains her reflection. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (terminal's fate) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Sable's agency: her survey leads to intensive proposal work, culminating in the board's conditional approval—a meaningful tightening that forecloses immediate demolition and opens a new path. Cost is legible in her "stoic intensity" and the unresolved wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of repurposing, intention, and hope emerge organically from particulars (carnival rigging, sextant inscription, hydraulic calculations). Subtext operates through image and implication; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material through the convergence of "hope and mathematics."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, tightly focalized through Sable. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature—thoughtful, precise, with a blend of technical and lyrical diction that reflects her mindset. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the proposal drafting) is purposeful and taught. Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance character, plot, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Line-level craft supports the closure effect without obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</comment>The premise—repurposing an abandoned spaceport via carnival improvisations—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The integration of engineering detail, symbolic object (sextant), and thematic depth feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, hopeful stance heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
