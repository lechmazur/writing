<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (pragmatic measurement vs. wistful risk) are embodied in concrete micro-choices, and her final act of planting the jasmine is earned by the prior loss, with the cost of uncertainty legible in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the closure is a Charged Poise that reconfigures the stakes of tending light. The cost of the rose's death and the jasmine's precarious future is felt in the final image, and the fire escape's constraint shapes the entire action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and fire escape are not just backdrop but actively pressure and enable Maren's gardening; the gauge tooth functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final planting beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, the death of the rose tightens the dominant stake (beauty vs. risk) and forces Maren's agentic choice to plant anew; the cost of vulnerable faith is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (the gauge tooth, mirrors, white flowers) and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—tending light without guarantee—that reweights all prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (locksmith's daughter's precision meets gardener's lyricism) and rhythmic control that modulates with the scene's meditative tempo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("mercury and glass," "balcony stolen from a cathedral") is consistently vivid and does not muddle clarity, even at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing and gardening feels inevitable and fresh; the quiet, internal risk—embracing vulnerability within routine—heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is fully earned.</comment>
