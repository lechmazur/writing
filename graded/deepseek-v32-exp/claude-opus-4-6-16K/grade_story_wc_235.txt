<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory (jealousy of past selves, jaded wonder), with embodied emotion ("feral thing in her chest howl"). Her final choice to keep writing is an earned endurance, foreclosing escape into despair with visible cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: she writes down the "beautiful, inconsolable howl," crystallizing acceptance of mortality and attention. Cost is legible in that final image; the accumulative lens holds, with the grave and scroll as persistent constraints that shape the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cabin, mountains, and birch bark scroll are filtered through Maren’s perception and actively constrain choice (solitude loosens memory, scroll is the tool of record). The scroll charges the final beat, and the setting’s brutality and beauty mirror her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making sense of life before death) tightens through the gravestone’s discovery and the dream of soaring, culminating in her decision to transcribe despite chaos. Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in the “inconsolable howl.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (time, memory, attention) emerges through specific images (grave, scroll, soaring) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: she keeps the dreams, not the dates, reweighting prior material through the final act of writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited voice is consistently embedded in Maren’s consciousness, with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. No head‑hopping; all description and reflection are filtered through her biased, memory‑loosened perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffolding. Figurative language (“nostalgia hit her like weather”) is precise and voice‑motivated. Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates and breathes with emotional beats, and the final image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, personal mortality, and mountain isolation feels organic and inevitable. Emotional specificity (feral nostalgia, jaded wonder) avoids generic templates, and the premise is transformed through grounded, character‑driven particulars.</comment>
