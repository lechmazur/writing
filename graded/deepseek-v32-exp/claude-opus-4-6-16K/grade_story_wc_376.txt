<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lien’s characterization is concrete and driven by a coherent, contradictory trait (wilts near dishonesty yet seeks truth). Interiority is embodied in physical reactions and micro-choices; her final act of transcribing and posting letters is earned by prior causality, with the cost of loneliness and effort visible. Minor deduction for some told-backstory (mother’s words) that doesn’t fully anchor in present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear causal linkages under a Causal lens; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Decisive Change (from passive sufferer to active disseminator of candor) with cost legible in the contrast between the toxic sky/dry oasis and the “flowing” honesty. The vault discovery feels slightly convenient but is motivated by earlier beats; the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (toxic sky, dried oasis, decaying post office). Micro-setting (gold leaf, bone folder, postal tubes) constrains actions and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lien’s professional POV. Minor deduction for a few decorative phrases (“fungal bloom”) that could be more tightly woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding/liberating lost truths) escalates through Lien’s agency: seeking the plate, piecing the map, retrieving letters. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, steady hands in vault, act of posting). One meaningful tightening—her decision to transcribe and display the letters—forecloses her earlier isolation and reweights the city’s emotional economy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of candor versus dishonesty emerges organically from events and images (unsent letters, gold leaf adherence). Subtext operates through gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of honesty “flowing” like an aquifer. The line “Candor in small moments was not small at all” verges on statement but is integrated into the realization beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable and apt. Voice has a distinct lyrical texture (“crackling off the page like dead skin”) that reflects Lien’s sensitivity. Perceptual signature is consistent; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Capped at 8.8 because Q2 is 8.8 (global 9+ gate requires Q2 ≥9.0).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong information density and varied syntax. Minor figurative muddle (“hoarding… roots” slightly anthropomorphic) and a cliché (“steady as a pulse”) in the closure beat, but these do not obscure causality. No loops, scaffolds, or momentum drag. Rhythm supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific (calligrapher wilts near dishonesty, vault of unsent letters). Tropes are transformed through grounded details and character-driven stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in magical realism pays off with coherent closure. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0 (global 9+ gate).</comment>
