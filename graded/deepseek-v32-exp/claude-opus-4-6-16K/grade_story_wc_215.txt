<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her motivation (fleeing attention) is clear, rooted in her "astonished recluse" trait. Her final choice (Earned Stasis to stay and carry the silence) is earned by her perceptive nature and the pressure of the ghosts' expectation. The cost is visible: "the weight of all those words pressing against her ribs." The closure choice feels inevitable from her established character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with on-page cost in the final paragraphs. The "tangled covenant" pattern is taught and pays off cleanly at the climax when she reads the papers, reconfiguring Maren's purpose from flight to stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, a character in itself that pressures choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Maren's perception ("desiccated husks... like dark confetti"). The oasis and the stained glass box constrain action and are central to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of understanding. The dominant stake (Maren's need to find a way to bear witness) tightens as she deciphers clues and faces the ghosts' silent plea. Her agency in opening the box and reading is the key turn, foreclosing her path of escape with the cost of accepting a burdensome purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of silence, witness, and carrying unspoken truth emerge organically from concrete particulars. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext in the ghosts' silent pleading and the box's contents is powerfully implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to Maren's perceptive, solitary nature. Rhythmic control is exceptional, modulating with emotional beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and vivid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is flawless at the line level. Sentences are varied and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("like light through stained glass"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm supports the accumulative, contemplative tone beautifully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic decay, ghostly regret, and a recluse's journey of witness feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail (beekeeping, stained glass covenant). The emotional truth and final reconfiguration are earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
