<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied, with a clear motivation rooted in aesthetic drive; her micro-choices under pressure, such as paraphrasing, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final realization of belonging is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; orientation anchored early; closure is a resonant reconfiguration ("she was the membrane itself, vibrating") with felt cost in the dissolution of boundaries, shaping tactics via quartz constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposefully filtered through Maren's POV; the quartz colonnade and frozen lake constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stride through boundaries) escalates via Maren's agency in paraphrasing, leading to a deepening that reweights options with cost legible in her vibrational transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries and beauty emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Every frozen thing still holds the memory of motion") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature as a cloud-shadow poet; voice is consistent and lyrical, modulating with emotional intensity, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is clear and purposeful, propelling momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poetic exile and resonant magic; specific details like cloud-shadow reading and humming quartz transform tropes, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes.</comment>
