<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's guilt and regret are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her final act of imperfect release is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the residue. Contradictory impulses—pride versus apology—act in scene, and the renunciation (accepting imperfection) carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost: the perfume bottle's lavender scent and the "imperfect grace" reconfigure meaning. Orientation is immediate; the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the archive's demolition deadline persistently tightens tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is indispensable, constraining choice (impending demolition) and charging the final image (orchard hush). Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Maren's professional perception, elevating atmosphere to narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect before demolition) escalates through Maren's agency—confession and ritual—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final residue (lavender scent) and the "imperfect grace" carried.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges from particulars (cold spots, lavender residue) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grace arrives too late yet is "enough," reweighting prior material through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature that filters the archive through musical metaphor. POV is stable; dialogue with Elsbeth carries subtext and advances plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("dust motes like eighth notes") is purposeful and coherent; sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of "gossip-column exorcist," sheet-music archive, and imperfect miracles feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
