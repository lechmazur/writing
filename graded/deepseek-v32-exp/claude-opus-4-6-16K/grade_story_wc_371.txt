<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her noticing is embodied; the final choice to garden is earned by her established affliction and the cost of the lost world. However, her internal conflict is under-dramatized, and the decision arrives with minimal friction, keeping it below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Maren's commitment to garden) under an accumulative lens, with cost legible in the stale bread and silent sky. The persistent constraint of forgetting shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposefully selective; the overgrown palace and guerrilla garden constrain choice and charge the final image of sacred ordinary resistance, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs. forgetting) escalate through Sable's revelation, deepening Maren's understanding; cost is felt in the bread as evidence, but agency is more reactive than proactive in the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (bread, garden, birds); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that mirrors Maren's noticing; rhythmic control and purposeful elision (e.g., "creeping normality") are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final beat lands with clarity and charged rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of forgetting via flour is fresh and synthesized with guerrilla gardening; the quiet, observant perspective feels organic and specific, with risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
