<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; internal contradiction between certainty and inaction earns her final confession with visible cost in the stone metaphor and margin writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the smudged illustration and written confession, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and the botanical illustration charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the station and objects constraining choice and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density increase; protagonist agency drives the confession turn, foreclosing silence with a felt cost tied to the swallowed truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on certainty and guilt without moralizing, via the margin writing and carried stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a perceptual signature tied to Sable's profession; POV is stable and lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of meteorological precision and personal guilt; specific details like margin writing and illustration transform tropes, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
