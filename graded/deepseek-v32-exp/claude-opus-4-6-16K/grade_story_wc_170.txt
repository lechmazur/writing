<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The painter's calm endurance and the revelation of her own possible future are earned through her interaction with Lisha; the cost of borrowed heartbeats is embodied, and her final choice to stay and teach is a credible endurance that forecloses her solitary path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the painter sees a future of distributed cost. The cost is legible in the narrowing silence between her heartbeats, and the persistent constraint of borrowed heartbeats shapes her tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prism parapet, echoing terrace, and belltower mirrors are essential, constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and woven into action, with the setting actively enabling the mirages and the story's turning point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artist's survival vs. mission) escalates through the painter's diminishing heartbeats; the turn is her agency in teaching Lisha and deciding to stay, which reweights the cost and offers a credible deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of art, sacrifice, and legacy emerges from concrete images (borrowed heartbeats, prism light) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the painter's vision and the narrowed silence between her heartbeats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature; the voice modulates with emotional intensity, and the patterned elision (e.g., the coded lullabies) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and the final image ("a rest resolving at last into the note") heightens clarity and propulsion without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirage painting, borrowed heartbeats, and prism parapet is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; the risk of a quiet, accumulative closure pays off with a fresh angle on artistic legacy and distributed cost.</comment>
