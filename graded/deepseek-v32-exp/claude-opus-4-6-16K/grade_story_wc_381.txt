<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as the last summoner; interiority is concrete via embodied actions (kneeling, setting the wing afloat) and exhaustion. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or internal conflict during the ritual limits depth, though her final choice to let the wing go is earned and carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the prophecy is hushed, the wing completes itself, and the world chooses peace with felt cost ("exhausted in the way that emptying oneself always exhausts"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; its flow carries the silences and the wing, while sensory details (moonlight, water, starlight) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception. The origami wing as a recurring object is indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing war by hushing the prophecy) is signaled early; escalation occurs through Elara's accumulative layering of silences, driven by her agency. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the wing's transformation, though the conflict remains internalized, limiting visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions: silence as power, incompleteness as completion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—peace through hushing, the wing finding purpose in silence—without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the mother's gift and the brook's patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("moonlight pooled in eddies of silver"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and the accumulative rhythm supports the tranquil tone. No dialogue, but internal focalization is precise and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot. No artifacts obscure closure; the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a solitary summoner, encoded prophecy, and silence-mapping feels fresh and inevitable. The origami wing and "smoothed hush" concept are specific and integral; risk-taking in a quiet, lyrical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
