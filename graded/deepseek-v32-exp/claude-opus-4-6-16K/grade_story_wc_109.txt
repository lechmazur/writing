<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's obsession is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices; final endurance earned with visible cost in shaking hands and silent acceptance, though contradictory impulses are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds tightly; closure is a charged poise with legible cost in the image of the universe "learning how to go quiet"; orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (ridge fort, towers) constrains choice and charges final image; sensory detail selective and woven through POV, with the booklet as micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via accumulating absence of stars; protagonist's agency in recording silence escalates to final entry with cost unmistakable in the "terrible gentleness" of the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mapping absence emerges through particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the image of the completed map and the last star, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV stable, voice distinct with perceptual signature focused on silence and observation; rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope with concept of documenting silence; risk in accumulative design pays off in inevitable closure, with specific details like the gold leaf booklet elevating originality.</comment>
