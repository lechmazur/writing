<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sael's jittery nature and internal conflict are concretely embodied; her final choice to plant the pendant is earned by prior causality with visible cost (lost fee, personal transformation). No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Sael planting the pendant and her hands stilling, a decisive change with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is immediate, and structure tightens meaningfully from her lingering to germination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (aurora, ridgeway) filtered through POV; the pendant as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image of germination, essential to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivery vs. preservation) escalates through the pendant's germination, driven by Sael's agency; cost is legible in her renunciation of fee and courier habit, foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. routine emerges organically from particulars like the pendant's hum and Oram's lessons; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through planting, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (Oram's absence) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, especially in peak beats like the pendant's germination, maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy relic courier with living artifact; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
