<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory; her desire to belong drives the search and the final carving. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though internal contradiction is more told than dramatized in scene. The final choice (carving names) is earned by the shared search and discovery of Cael, with visible cost in the emotional release and communal hand-press.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: Sable's want leads to Ren's offer, the search, finding Cael, and the carving. Closure is a decisive change (dedicating names on the arbor) with felt cost in the communal act and the shift from longing to belonging. Orientation is anchored early; the two-shard structure (arrival then search) is seamless and tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly specific and integral to choice: the orchard hosts the search, the arbor is the site of closure. Sensory details (light, glass-like branches) are filtered through Sable's perception and charge the final image. Setting constrains tactics (the community's rituals) and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) is signaled early and tightens through the shared search, which narrows options and leads to Cael. Escalation is driven by Sable and Ren's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the carving and the emotional weight of the hand-press, foreclosing solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (belonging, grafting, reconstruction) emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement. The final carving and hand-press offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV (Sable) is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature tied to her craft. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; elision (time during search) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; diction is precise and voice-motivated. The final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (search for belonging) through unique setting (crystalline orchard) and specific craft (marsh-reed sculptor). The grafting metaphor and obsidian arbor are fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
