<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope), with embodied interiority (e.g., touching the glass eyes "reverently, seeking certainty"). Her earned stasis—continuing the search after the conjuring reveals iteration, not resolution—is foreclosed with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a charged poise: the spell's outcome ("the formula had shifted... moved one decimal place closer") reconfigures options with felt cost (enduring unresolved loss), and the persistent constraint of ambiguous loss shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the cavern orchard and mosaic stepping stone constrain Maren's conjuring choices and charge the final image ("the pale trees went on growing toward a light"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving ambiguous loss) escalates under the accumulative lens via Maren's agency in the conjuring ritual. Cost is legible in her realization that emotion iterates, not resolves, and her decision to continue searching, narrowing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and emotional mathematics emerges through particulars (conjuring, mosaic, glass eyes). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the asymptote image and shifted formula, avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, mathematical lexicon reflecting Maren's mind). Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., spell rise and quiet aftermath) and purposeful elision (e.g., Elda's backstory interwoven) enhance coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("fruit glowed... like small predictions") is consistent and clear, and sentence-level propulsion varies naturally to support momentum, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conjuring, taxidermy, and mathematical emotion feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (glass eyes, mosaic) and emotional complexity avoid template plots.</comment>
