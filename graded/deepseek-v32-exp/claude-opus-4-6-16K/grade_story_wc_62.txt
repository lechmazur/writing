<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover collective grief is clear and intensifies through embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her fierce meditation enables spectral guidance, and her final endurance—carrying the dead forward—is earned with visible cost. However, the characterization leans slightly toward serene consistency, with minimal internal contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as Elara completes the memorial and feels her grandmother's presence settle, with cost legible in "sediment settles after a river floods." The accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, and orientation is anchored early. The ribbon roll and migration timeframe provide persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Elara's POV; the greenhouse and monarch migration constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment integral to action and theme. No ornamental description; everything serves pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase (ribbon use, carving, migration progression). Agency is clear in Elara's active carving guided by heritage, with cost visible in the finished stone and ongoing mentorship. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief as architecture, inheritance as luminous mentorship. Subtext operates through image and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the final stone and forward carry. No moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, meditative, and poetically controlled. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., spectral guidance) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; narrative distance remains apt throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously; closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize freshly: gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, and ribbon roll create a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off with emotional specificity and authentic vision. No derivative echoes; transformation is thorough.</comment>
