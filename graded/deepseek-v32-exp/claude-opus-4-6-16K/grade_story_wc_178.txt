<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's frugality and devotion are consistently embodied, with micro-choices like tracing stars revealing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation to keep watching is earned by prior causality, cost visible in her acceptance of the void's indifference.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "She found this sufficient." Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; pattern discovery drives escalation via density increase, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through Miriam's astronomer POV with vivid sensory detail (e.g., "light turned the color of old bronze"). The palace schematics and tile constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Miriam's quest to understand encrypted devotion, escalating through her active discovery of the uncloaked stars. Agency under Accumulative lens drives meaningful tightening, with cost unmistakable in her whispered covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of covenant and encrypted devotion emerges through concrete events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Miriam's whisper, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature as an astronomer; voice is controlled and rhythmic, reflecting Miriam's mindset. No head-hopping or elision issues, and diction remains within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise (e.g., "hummed faintly under starlight") and supports pressure without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of encrypted devotion in star maps is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific character detail and Babylonian cosmology. Quiet ending risks heighten stakes, and turns feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
