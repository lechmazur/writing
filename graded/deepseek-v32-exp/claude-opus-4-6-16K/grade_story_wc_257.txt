<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied and specific, her micro-choices (tracing, observing, creating) reveal a gradual, credible re-engagement. The final act of making a brooch for herself is an earned renunciation of passivity, though her agency remains more receptive than decisive, slightly capping the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she leaves a coordinate for the next person and descends, having reconfigured her relationship to grief. The origami mechanism’s ambiguous origin is a patterned elision that does not harm causality or cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory as a "perpetual dusk" is a micro-setting that directly constrains choice and perception. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through her professional eye ("genuine artifice"). The environment actively supplies the tools (telescope, copper, glass) that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (moving through paralyzing grief). Escalation is accumulative, driven by her agency in following coordinates and returning to craft. A single meaningful tightening occurs: her decision to make the brooch for herself, which forecloses the path of pure withdrawal with visible cost (accepting loss without erasing it).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief through "genuine artifice" emerges organically from the juxtaposition of mourning jewelry and telescopic ghosts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the brooch casting a constellation. No moralizing; subtext is rich in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deep. Voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature shaped by her trade ("genuine artifice"). Prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (origami origin) is taught and pays off in closure's open-handed gesture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, rhythmic control, and figurative language that coheres ("curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. A single minor overwriting moment ("shadow-Loss... light-bloom") is hairline and doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, astronomy, and a healing retreat feels inevitable and fresh. The central conceit—celestial observation as a mirror for grief-work—is executed with full commitment and specificity. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
