<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia and professional defiance are embodied in concrete micro-choices (counting steps, using the compass) under pressure; the final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her fear is never abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage is tight (because/therefore from tunnel shift to organ resonance to compass guidance); closure lands with a decisive change (key retrieved, ascent begun) and felt cost in her counted steps; orientation is immediate and lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting—ruined church, shifting tunnels, organ pipes—pressures choices at every turn; the compass as micro-setting constrains tactics and charges the final image with starlight; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key retrieval vs. claustrophobia) escalates through spatial mutiny and organ counterpoint; protagonist agency (using compass as tuning fork) drives the turn; cost is legible in her hammering pulse and stubborn breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “wistful rebellion” emerges through image and action, not statement; the final wind “like gratitude” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights defiance as tender endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (cartographer’s attention, claustrophobic narrowing); lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure; purposeful elision (organ mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language (“spatial mutiny,” “tuning fork”) is coherent and heightens clarity; sentence rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobic explorer, spatial mutiny, and acoustic architecture feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric description heightens stakes without obscuring causality; transformation of familiar tropes through specific, lived detail.</comment>
