<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation is clear and rooted in her belief in small moments. Interiority is concrete (e.g., "haunted euphoria") and emotions are embodied. The final endurance is earned with cost (aching knees, full heart). Minor: could show more contradictory impulses in scene, but overall strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a charged poise with cost legible in the final paragraph. The covenant's regeneration is the decisive change, and the engineered destruction shapes tactics. Orientation is immediate, and causality is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory detail and charges the final image. The blooming jetty and twilight atmosphere are integrated into action and reflect internal state. However, the setting does not heavily constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the covenant) escalates through the discovery of engineered destruction and the act of restoration. Cost is felt in her physical and emotional state. Agency drives the escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserving small moments against grand narratives emerges organically from particulars. The final image of the covenant breathing offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (archivist's attention to detail) and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical yet precise, matching character. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting. Sentences vary in rhythm and advance story; information density is high. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Craft is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of an archivist regenerating a covenant is fresh and specific. Synthesis of historical research, personal motivation, and quiet action feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet plot heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
