<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's grief-driven motivation is concrete and embodied; her final subdued awakening earns its cost through prior causality, with no diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the acknowledgment line; the accumulative lens holds, and the 12-minute window persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station and magnetic nexus constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, tightening via the experiment's pulse and data; cost is legible in her trembling hands and frost-like awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—sideways time, holographic proof, velith migrations—with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final acknowledgment; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and lyricism; voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("frost forming on glass") is purposeful and clear in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and theoretical physics feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual repricing of time heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
