<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selin's characterization is concrete and embodied; her retrocognitive condition and purpose "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" drive micro-choices under pressure, with the final act of speaking the name earned by prior causality and visible cost (the loosening of the pull). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and contradictory impulses are shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation anchored early, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as speaking "Dahra" reconfigures meaning with legible cost ("felt the retrocognitive pull release, just slightly"). Persistent constraint (retrocognition) shapes tactics; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective ("fractured dome of ash and light") and constrains choice: the mosaic tessera functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and shaping Selin's action. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV, with no generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Selin's work of empathetic revolution) escalates through her agency under the Accumulative lens: tracing the tile leads to understanding Oren's story and the decisive act of speaking the name, with cost legible in the release and the "aching" heart. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as structured revolution, mercy with cost) emerges organically from particulars like Oren's embedded grief and Selin's renaming; subtext operates through image and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, diction consistent, and rhythmic modulation supports pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the retrocognitive trap) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no overwriting in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates the accumulative pattern, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes retrocognition with empathetic revolution in a fresh, non-obvious way; turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, avoiding template plots.</comment>
