<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and particular; her curiosity is a consistent trait that compels higher-stakes choices (taking the diary, using the goggles). Interiority is embodied, not labeled (breath catching, wiping eyes with sleeve). The final realization about ascent is earned by prior causality, though the emotional progression is smooth verging on tidy. A hairline slip prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren reconceives her ascent, with cost legible in the final image of her placing the goggles over her eyes. Structure is clean, using the elevator's ascent to frame revelations. The decryption method is slightly convenient but integrated into the taught pattern of light and perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and the elevator's crystalline walls are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's POV (light quality, groaning cables). The recurring object (goggles) transforms the environment, directly shaping the climax and its meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's internal search for meaning/recognition) is signaled early and tightens through the accumulative discovery of Halse's entries. Escalation is driven by her agency in using the goggles and reading, deepening emotional stakes. A clear, felt cost is registered in her wiped eyes and the reconfigured final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding "the joy beneath anguish" and the meaning of ascent emerges organically from particulars (diary, goggles, elevator). Subtext operates powerfully in Halse's encrypted confessions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the final paragraph's "less like burden and more like being chosen" leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature ("light fracturing through the spire's icy walls"). Diction and syntax remain within Maren's plausible lexicon while achieving poetic precision. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly controlled, with sentences doing multiple jobs (advancing plot, deepening character, enriching atmosphere). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. One minor hitch: the phrase "less like burden and more like being chosen" has a slight tell-quality. Otherwise, exemplary line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar elements (isolated tower, encrypted diary, forgotten servant). The specific mechanics of decryption (amber lenses + scattered light) are inventive and integral. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in a quiet, internal climax heighten stakes without gimmickry. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
