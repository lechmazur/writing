<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her erased identity and desire to discover the texture of memories. Interiority is concrete through specific possessions and actions (the poison label, layering fragments). Micro-choices under pressure are evident (collecting stories, moving with tides, taking the certificate). The final endurance (continuing to map) is earned, with cost felt in her unchanged legal status but reconfigured purpose. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in her perceptual filter and tactile interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where finding the death certificates reweights erasure with the cost of making the dead visible. Orientation is clear early (Maren, port city, containers). Pattern of collecting fragments is taught by ~25% and pays off at closure. The final image ("The map grows... makes the dead visible") lands with undeniable conceptual cost, and the lens remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the labyrinth of shipping containers pressures choices (tides force movement, reveal new containers) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's POV (port as "library of vanished lives"). The environment constrains tactics and supplies the climax (filing cabinets found at low tide). Micro-setting (poison label, container wall) recurs with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering texture of memories) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative density: her map grows, culminating in finding the death certificates. Agency drives escalation (she chooses to listen, collect, and add the certificate). Cost is legible on page: her map "does not restore her" but "makes the dead visible," a trade-off that forecloses reinstatement with a conceptual price. Pressure tightens under the accumulative lens via pattern break (the certificate discovery).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (erasure, memory, bureaucracy) emerges organically from concrete particulars (poison label, fragments, tides). Subtext operates in images and silences; no moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: visibility becomes a form of naming for the erased. The poison label's integrity and the map's growth reweight prior material without statement. Earned wisdom arises from Maren's specific, layered experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Maren) is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, reflective, with a focus on fragments and erasure. No dialogue, but narration's rhythm and diction reflect her consciousness (e.g., "digested her identity and excreted nothing useful"). Purposeful compression (the three-year backstory) is anchored in present cues. No head-hopping; distance is consistent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "She filters reality differently now..."). No loops, scaffold, or overwriting. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated ("the bureaucracy had already digested her identity"). Closure image is clear and uncluttered by artifacts. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on identity erasure, synthesized with specific setting (shipping container labyrinth) and accumulative structure. Emotional truth emerges through particular details (poison label, Soviet-era clocks). Risk-taking in quiet, conceptual closure pays off. Transformation of the "erased person" trope through grounded world-building and Maren's specific motivation feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
