<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her deafness and loss; interiority is embodied through vibrations and the "filament of hush"; her final change—weeping and setting aside the needle—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with cost (weeping, needle abandoned) and reconfigures the hush; orientation early; persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern and needle constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "audibly muted pulses" are selective and purposeful; setting actively shapes resonance and emotional breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake is emotional connection to music; escalation through repeated experiments culminates in frost-night breakthrough; agency drives the turn, cost legible in silent weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. sound emerges through backward songs and the "filament of hush"; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer—hush as space for feeling—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature filtered through deafness; voice is lyrical and consistent; internal rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and no loops; figurative language like "filament of hush" is coherent; rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a deaf music teacher using backward songs to feel music; concept feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in focus on silence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
