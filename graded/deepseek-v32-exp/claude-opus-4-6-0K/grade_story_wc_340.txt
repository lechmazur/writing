<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lenne's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interiority is concrete and embodied. The final choice—stepping out with calm exterior and inner warmth—is earned by the causal chain of reading the diary and understanding her mother's message, with visible cost in the reconfiguration of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (Lenne reconfigures her understanding of her mother's disappearance) with felt cost in the final image. The elevator climb and diary reading provide a coherent, escalating structure; orientation is immediate and anchors the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and prismatic light are essential, constraining the diary's decryption and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lenne's perception; the setting pressures choices and deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about her mother) escalates through Lenne's active reading of the diary, driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in her emotional reconfiguration and the resolve to carry joy, foreclosing her prior grief without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically from diary entries and the final image; subtext operates through implication and resonant closure. The ending offers a non-literal answer—carrying joy like a lantern—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Lenne's voice is lyrical and precise, modulating with emotional intensity. The prose rhythm supports pressure; no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level craft heightens atmosphere and momentum; information density is high without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elevator ascent, encrypted diary, and icebound setting feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional specificity and risk-taking (e.g., the precise decryption method) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
