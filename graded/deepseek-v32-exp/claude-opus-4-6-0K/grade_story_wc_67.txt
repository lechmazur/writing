<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion; her final realization—that she preserves disappearance, not her mother—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with cost legible in the final image of her holding the mask; orientation is clear early and the pattern teaches itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery and objects (mask, rocking chair, charcoal) constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallizing the emotion of safety's mirage) is signaled early; escalation occurs through density increase and a final deepening that reweights the stake with felt cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about truth and disappearance without moralizing, reweighting prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical, precise, and consistently filtered through Elara's perception; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or artifacts; every sentence advances atmosphere or character; figurative language is purposeful and clarity is maintained even at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of art, grief, and perception; the vanishing point gallery and kintsugi mask are fresh, specific, and fully integrated; the story commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
