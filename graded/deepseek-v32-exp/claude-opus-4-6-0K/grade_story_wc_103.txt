<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's obsession is concretely embodied through her photographs and journal; her contradictory impulse to return despite the danger drives the plot. The final renunciation (setting down the camera) is earned by her prior causality and carries the visible cost of surrendering her present identity. Interiority is specific, not stock, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held cleanly: pattern of fading photographs and spatial warping deepens into a temporal reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she recognizes and accepts the garden's design for her, with cost legible in "The photographs would keep fading, and she would keep remembering..." Causality is tight; the halo fragment discovery leads inevitably to the final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, not backdrop: it actively consumes memory, warps geometry, and supplies the halo fragment. Environment constrains every choice and charges the final image of "walking deeper into a time that had no edges, only roots." Sensory detail ("root-woven spans," "gauze-white shapes") is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. being consumed by time) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative deepening: the photographs fade, her retrocognition grows, the halo fragment reveals the garden's intent. Escalation is driven by her agency in pursuing the mystery. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of her present/past as recorded proof, exchanged for a timeless, root-threaded existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time, memory, acceptance of being part of a larger design) emerges organically from concrete particulars—fading photos, hyperbolic bridges, the halo fragment. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of walking into fibrous time, reweighting her life's work of designing labyrinths. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person filtered through Elara's analytical, perceptive mind. Voice has a distinct lyrical precision suited to her profession ("hyperbolic geometry," "pleated with it"). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. The prose's rhythmic control heightens pressure, especially in the revelatory paragraph beginning "Elara understood then."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and varied, purposeful rhythm. Sentences do multiple jobs ("The garden was feeding her its past while draining her present..."). Zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("pigment lifting from paper like breath leaving a body") is precise and enhances clarity. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a living garden, temporal consumption, hyperbolic geometry, and a protagonist whose expertise mirrors the trap. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative. Bold risk-taking in the abstract, lyrical treatment of time pays off with emotional and conceptual resonance. Specificity of detail (ficus and rubber tree, 1953 rain weight) grounds the fantastic.</comment>
