<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mordecai’s interiority is concrete and his motivation to archive emotion is clear, but contradictory impulses under pressure are not fully dramatized in scene; the final choice to transcribe the warning is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Mordecai shifts to archiving a warning—under a causal lens that holds; orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the “velvet disquiet” and hope that “someone alive would think to read it.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard garden atop a skyscraper charges the final image with fog and untouched apples, reinforcing impermanence; sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, though it does not tightly constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency: transcription leads to accidental prophecy, forcing Mordecai’s decision to warn; cost is felt in the disquiet and weight of future sorrows, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—language, emotion, prophecy—with subtext in the rosemary memory; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and scholar-filtered; POV is stable and single, with a clear perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line-level craft accelerates toward closure without obstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archiving emotion, dead languages, and accidental prophecy feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
