<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concretely embodied through tactile perception; her motivation to find stillpoint is clear, and the release at climax is earned by prior causality with visible cost in shedding absorbed languages.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Maren's release and self-discovery; accumulative lens holds via sensory density; cost is legible in "poured out of her palms" and the ring pointing inward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice via ultrasonic vibrations and musical trail; forest and stillpoint charge the final image with "burning quietly like a star."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through melody mapping her interior; agency in dowsing and release drives escalation; cost is unmistakable in relinquishing languages for self-tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-reclamation emerges through particulars like the melody charting her geography; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV stable with distinct perceptual signature of blindness and touch; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "blazing quiet of her own unmediated existence."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density without loops; figurative language like "grief older than her own" is purposeful; sentences advance story and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking, blindness, ultrasonic forest; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
