<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her blindness and skill shown through tactile action. Her final intuitive calibration ("You feel it") is a credible earned endurance rooted in her established traits. Minor deduction for a slight summary feel in the backstory paragraph, but interiority remains anchored in present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal (repair needed to enable departure). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara returns to her shop, the mist closes, reconfiguring the departure as part of a cycle of mending. Cost is legible in the final image's quiet endurance. Structure is a single, taut scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and fountain are not just atmosphere; they are the essential testbed for the drone's calibration, constraining Elara's method. The setting pressures the choice (repair must use the fountain's refraction). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her non-visual POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ship's safe departure hinges on repair) is signaled early and tightens via the live clock ("in less than an hour"). Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens—her diagnostic and repair sequence. The cost of potential failure is felt, though the success is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (perception beyond sight, repair as cyclical departure) emerges seamlessly from concrete action and the central metaphor of the fountain. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the mist and the shop as elements of a understood cycle. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's blindness, creating a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "throwing vibrations through her fingertips"). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density. Minor deduction for a touch of overwriting in the opening paragraph ("magnetic calm") that slightly stalls momentum. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character; rhythm is excellent; no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, artisan repair, and navigational technology feels fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded detail. The final image is a non-obvious, inevitable-seeming synthesis of the story's elements.</comment>
