<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction (coming to die yet volunteering) is embodied in concrete perception and micro-choices. Her final charged poise—not answering the clinic—is earned by the accumulative pressure of the parasol find and the work, with visible cost in the foreclosed euthanasia path. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensory detail (shimmer, cold as second skeleton).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where Maren shifts from scheduled death to open endurance. Cost is legible in the final image: “the ice shifted beneath the pier, and she shifted with it, loosely, the way the living grip what remains.” Orientation is anchored early; transitions between shards are legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is indispensable, constraining choice (volunteer work, trawling) and charging the final image. Micro-setting (parasol tip) recurs with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Maren’s urgency and perception (cold as a second skeleton, frost on lace). No generic placeholder; environment actively pressures and transforms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to die or to endure) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative density—parasol discovery, changed mornings, shared thermoses—culminating in her refusal to answer the clinic. Agency is clear: her decision forecloses the euthanasia path with felt cost. One meaningful tightening (the fold in patience deepening) reweights options under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (endings as plural, lived sounds) emerges through particulars—parasol tip, wind, grapple drag—without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “Endings, she understood now, had no single sound.” Subtext operates in gesture and silence; earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, not platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maren’s perceptual signature (shimmer, halo). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation that heightens pressure without obscurity. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“the tumor behind her left eye made the world shimmer at its edges”) is consistent and character‑specific. Sentence‑level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. No overwriting or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise (euthanasia tourist finding solace in Arctic volunteer work) is fresh and transformed through specific, grounded detail. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk‑taking (quiet, accumulative ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template plots or near‑echoes; originality lies in emotional specificity and singular vision.</comment>
