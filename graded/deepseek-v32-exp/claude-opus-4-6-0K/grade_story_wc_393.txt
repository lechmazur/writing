<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elda's contradictory impulses—resistance versus duty—are rendered in concrete micro-choices (the sharp look, the deliberate winding). Her final decision is earned by the pressure of the chaplain's witness and the broken heart, with visible cost when she presses her knuckles to her lips. Tomás serves as a stable observer, but his interiority remains somewhat passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elda's decision to deliver the heart crystallizes under situational pressure, with cost legible in her reaction and the final blazing light. The lens (Situational) holds, and orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The repair shop is a micro-setting that constrains choice (tools, atmosphere) and charges the final image with the storm-light motif. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV, creating a "vibrant hush" that supports the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the situational lens, pressure coheres around Elda's hesitation and tightens through the repair act. The dominant stake (will she commit?) escalates via her agency in winding the spring, with cost unmistakable in the lullaby's emergence and her knuckles pressed to her lips.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (apology as repair, words versus action) emerges through the clockwork heart's concrete particulars and the final image of light and song. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited primarily through Tomás is stable and apt; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "fractured bands" of light). Dialogue is sparse, natural, and carries subtext. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language ("the room were holding its breath") is purposeful and clear. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The clockwork heart premise is a fresh synthesis of mechanical and emotional repair, grounded in specific, lived detail. Risk-taking in the quiet, situational escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry; the ending feels inevitable.</comment>
