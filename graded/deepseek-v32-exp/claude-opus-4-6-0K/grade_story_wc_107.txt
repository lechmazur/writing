<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction (solitude vs. connection) acts in scene; her final choice to open the learning house is earned by the thaw metaphor and prior causality with visible cost (leaving safe isolation). No label-speak; embodied emotion in gestures like the dramatic narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (abandoning solitude). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thaw and glassblowing deepens to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear early; bookmark and river ice constrain the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (studio, annealing oven) and charges the final image (thawing river parallels her decision). Sensory detail (meltwater drumming, taste of iron) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will she remain isolated?) escalates under Accumulative lens via layered reflection and external thaw; protagonist agency drives the decisive tightening (resolve to open learning house). Cost is legible in her foreclosed solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (thawing, inquiry, silence) emerges through concrete particulars (glass orbs, bookmark, river ice). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of shaping glass while the season works on the frozen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single PVO stable; voice distinct via theatrical narration modulating to quieter truth. Perceptual signature selective (dead instrument panels, cracked window). No head-hopping; elision (father's backstory) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose dense without loops; figurative language consistent ("ice was still a locked jaw"). Rhythm varies with scene needs; information density high (glassblowing steps carry thematic weight). No artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing, dam setting, and thaw metaphor feels inevitable. Risk-taking (internal focus, quiet climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (bookmark, control room) are irreplaceable.</comment>
