<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's perceptive interiority is concretely embodied (breath catching, sinking to knees), and her final commitment—to spend her life carrying echoes—is earned by the cascading revelations. The choice forecloses a normal path with a felt cost of "reed-blown melancholy," satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren takes up her role, with cost legible in the image of her walking deeper, "the stone remembered." Orientation is immediate, causality seamless through progressive disclosure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is not just vivid backdrop but actively constrains choice (branching corridors dictate her path) and charges the final image. Sensory detail (starlight pooling, shell's hum) is filtered through Maren's professional perception, achieving indispensability.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (learn why some echo) tighten through accumulative deepening as each layer of voices is disclosed. Maren's agency drives escalation—choosing the left corridor, singing into the shell—culminating in a decision that forecloses other paths with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and connection emerges through concrete particulars (the web of voices, the shell) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: voices exceed the moment, and the listener's duty is to carry them forward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maren's perceptive signature. Lyrical, rhythmic prose reflects her consciousness without head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "The remainder lodges in stone") teaches its pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet lucid, with varied syntax and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a river that had forgotten how to flow") is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with the revelation beats, never obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of echo singers and a canyon that remembers is a fresh, specific synthesis. Emotional truth arises from grounded particulars, and the quiet, lyrical resolution takes bold risks that heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
