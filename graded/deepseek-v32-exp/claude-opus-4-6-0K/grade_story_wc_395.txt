<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's obsessive attention and micro-choices under pressure are concretely embodied; her final decision to call the journalist is earned by prior causality and carries visible risk, though the trait "brightly attentive" is somewhat told rather than fully shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (calling the journalist) with felt cost (corporate retaliation risk) and a resonant reconfiguration of the archive's hum; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive as setting constrains and enables investigation; the singed patch recurs and charges the final image with tangible loss; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through Maren's agency—each discovery narrows options and raises cost; the final choice to expose the lie forecloses her safety with unmistakable on-page risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, deletion, and corporate silence emerge through specific details (patch, number, log) without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth can be recovered even when a person cannot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, slightly poetic voice that matches Maren's attentiveness; the single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmically varied, and free of loops or scaffold; information density is high without overwriting; figurative language ("like a held breath finally released") serves closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate archive, cold case, and digital archaeology; the recurring number and patch transform familiar whistleblower tropes through specific, grounded details; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
