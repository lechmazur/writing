<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's sharp-eyed observation and "softly deliberate" tenderness ground her motivation; her internal conflict between archival purity and preserving hope is concretely embodied in the decision to metamorphose the archive, earned by prior causality with visible cost (the grief of impurity).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren begins re-binding shadows at dusk, a threshold moment that reconfigures meaning with felt cost (acceptance of impurity, library's withering branches).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library's stratospheric bloom, petal-pages, and pollen-scented air are vivid and purposeful; the river stone as a recurring object constrains choice (used to regather shadows) and charges the final image, fully integrated with pressure and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) escalates through Maren's discovery of unbound shadows and her decisive choice to metamorphose the archive, foreclosing purity with legible cost (the scholar's grief, accepted impurity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope, loss, and transformation emerges through image and action, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—dusk as threshold, restoration through "softly deliberate" work—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("dusk noticer"); lyrical, precise prose reflects Maren's attentive nature; patterned elision (archive materializing objects) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences vary naturally, advancing story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, organic synthesis of dream archive, unbound shadows as hope's architecture, and metamorphosis; risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
