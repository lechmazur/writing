<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sael's motivation (resenting erasure, not revelation) is clear, consistent, and drives her micro-choices. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene. The final stance (satisfaction in coexistence) is earned by her on-page labor, with cost felt in her sustained effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Sael observing the preserved balance; cost is legible in her labor and the tension between old and new. The prophet's arrival provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and desert setting are vividly specific and integral to the plot. The environment constrains Sael's choices (walking lines, sensing seams) and charges the final image of nested clearings beneath the noise. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving old whispers) is signaled early and escalates through Sael's agency—her 19 clearings are a direct response to the prophet's disruption. Cost is visible in her all-night labor and the satisfied but peripheral stance at closure. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom as space for multiple voices) emerges organically from action and image. The final line articulates it explicitly but is earned by prior particulars. Subtext operates in Sael's honesty and the clearings' silent preservation. Minor deduction for thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters through Sael's professional attention. No head-hopping. Dialogue (one exchange) is natural and character-revealing. Purposeful compression supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("columns of woven air," "whispers drifted like pollen") is consistent and vivid. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar themes (preservation vs. new revelation) through a unique, fully realized concept (murmuring pavilion, line walkers, kinetic parapet). The world-building feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the poetic, meditative tone that heightens stakes.</comment>
