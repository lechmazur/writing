<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's "mournfully eager" interiority is embodied and contradictory, driving micro-choices; her final weeping is earned by seven years of causality, with visible cost as she must learn to live in the laughter again.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands on-page with Rosie's laugh and Maren's wept cost, anchored by the hourglass constraint; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel and leaf blowers are indispensable, constraining tactics and charging the final image; sensory detail ("concrete throat," warped sound) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring laughter) escalates via Maren's agency in the final performance; cost is legible in her knees-buckling weep and the reconfiguration of her purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tending the unspoken emerges through action and image, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—laughter returned but with the cost of relearning how to live.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("a concrete throat," "fossil of a laugh"); voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("emotional pulp," "off-key wind") is coherent and advances pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of leaf-blower symphony and emotional healing feels inevitable; risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, grounded in specific lived detail.</comment>
