<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her micro-choices under pressure, like dubbing tones and following a chord branch, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning her transformation from passive prophet to active composer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise with Sable composing the future; accumulative/textural lens holds consistently; orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the vibrating orchard and her decisive shift from prediction to creation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the floating orchard functions as an instrument, charging the final image with sensory detail filtered through Sable's POV, elevating atmosphere to integral stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Sable's agency as she generates fractals and responds to cloud patterns; cost is visible in her refusal to let loss be final, leading to a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of turning obstacles into instruments emerges organically from actions and images; subtext in music and clouds; ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with consistent single POV; perceptual signature through Sable's interpretations; rhythmic control under pressure, and no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear, though minor richness borders on overwriting without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality is high with fresh synthesis of prophet, music, and survival; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
