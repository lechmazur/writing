<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and contradictory; her wistfulness and aromatic caution are embodied in micro-choices (uncapping the vial) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to sleep with the vial uncapped is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tears as fidelity). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, embodied perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's realization reweights her relationship with memory and loss. Cost is legible in the line "the tears were not malfunction but fidelity." One meaningful tightening (collision of scents) leads to the decisive emotional shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; its "crystal shadows" and extinct plants mirror internal states. Sensory detail (olfactory, visual) is selective and filtered through Elara's professional POV. The UV lamp and perfume vial are objects-as-setting that actively shape revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative density—the silphium's scent and the vial's uncapping deepen emotional pressure. Agency is clear: Elara's choice to uncap the vial triggers the climax. Cost is felt in her grieving and the reconfigured stance toward memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (memory, extinction, fidelity) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the lantern broker trading in light, the extinct plant, the perfume vial. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief as the body's insistence on remembering. No moralizing; subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("like watching a ghost remember its own heartbeat"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, maintaining clarity under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (the mother's backstory) is anchored in present stimuli and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; sentences vary rhythmically and advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density is high. The final image ("crystal shadows followed her like faithful, transparent ghosts") recharges earlier motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (lantern broker of bioluminescent flora, olfactory memory, extinct plant revival) is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; the combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
