<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her motivation—seeking absolution through witnessing—is clear and consistent. Her final decision to uncloak the tea house arises from a credible internal conflict and is earned by prior reflection, with the cost of losing secrecy felt in the closing image. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in actions like eating the bread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguration as Maren decides to gently share her sanctuary. Orientation is immediate, and the cost of tenuous absolution is legible on-page in the final paragraph's image of mint growing and her quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and deeply integrated: the overgrown courtyard and secret tea house constrain Maren's choices and charge the final decision to uncloak. Sensory details (chamomile scent, bread's taste) are filtered through her POV and serve thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (absolution vs. erasure) escalate accumulatively through Maren's reflections, culminating in her active decision to uncloak, which forecloses her private sanctuary with a visible, felt cost. Agency drives the tightening under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinary and witnessing emerges organically from concrete particulars (bread score marks, guerrilla gardening). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maren's decision and the final image, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is rich and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to Maren's perceptive POV. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Prose rhythm modulates with reflective pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., flashback shards) is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and peak beats (e.g., the decision paragraph) are clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar themes (loss, memory) through specific, grounded elements (creeping normality, guerrilla gardening). The perspective feels singular and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative template.</comment>
