<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luma's grief and artistic sensibility are embodied in specific actions and memories; her change from stopped to painting again is earned by the fragment-triggered network of joy, with cost felt in "pensive mirth."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative texture builds to a decisive change—her laugh and decision to paint—with cost legible in "pensive mirth"; closure is a resonant reconfiguration that holds the lens without flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog are memory made visible, constraining choice and charging the final image of fog as gallery; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and inseparable from the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of light in fog and art as memory emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV with a poetic, textured voice that mirrors Luma's perception; diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure, and no elision obscures clarity.</comment>
