<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (wreck-diver, ghost whisperer). Interiority is concrete, and her final choice to expose the truth carefully is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic label-speak (“she weaves truth carefully”) but it is anchored in embodied action and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Clear because/therefore linkages from investigation to shrine visit to dream revelations. Orientation is anchored early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost: Maren resolves to expose the truth, carrying "forty-three whispered names." The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is essential and vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (candle flames, blue-white ice, warped dome). The shrine and the melted snow globe function as micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image. Spatial choreography and POV filter are flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the truth) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens: each dream revelation narrows options and deepens knowledge. The cost is legible in her resolve to proceed with precision, foreclosing a reckless path. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (salvaging truth from wreckage, the cost of listening) emerges organically through specific images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of “borrowed starlight” and “whispered names.” No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional priorities. No head-hopping. The elision of dream mechanics is taught early and pays off at closure. Prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, polished, and propulsive. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and supports the story’s cadence. Minor overwriting in a phrase or two does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, specific synthesis: ghost-whispering via dream analysis in an Arctic investigative frame. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail. The risk of a quiet, interior climax pays off with a Charged Poise that feels inevitable in hindsight. Authentic vision and conceptual integrity.</comment>
