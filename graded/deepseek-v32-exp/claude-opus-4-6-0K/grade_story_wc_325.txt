<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia and mission are concrete and drive micro-choices under tidal pressure. The final endurance is earned, with embodied cost in the tightening lungs and the weight on her back. No diagnostic label-speak; interior contradiction is shown in the counting against the walls' press.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the weight of the unremembered and the ocean's whisper reconfigure the mission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, tightening via the ticking tide and codex discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the final image makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the tide-breathing facility constrains choice (the 18-minute clock) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's urgency and profession. The codex as micro-setting evolves meaning and is tactilely handled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the unremembered) escalates via the codex discovery and the tidal clock. Maren's agency—photographing, taking the codex—forecloses other options with visible cost (the constriction overcome, the weight carried). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erased labor emerges through particulars: the gold flecks, the tidal signals, the list of names. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—carrying the proof while the ocean whispers—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the facility’s breath and the phase transitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice (“the facility breathed with the tide”). Syntax modulates with pressure (short bursts during constriction). No head‑hopping; all perception is filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (“altars to an abandoned faith”). No overwriting or register drift. The final sentence lands with resonant cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobic spelunker, Cold War listening post, and tidal-phase signals. The perspective is specific and emotionally grounded. Risk‑taking in the accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
