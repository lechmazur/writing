<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's insomnia and painterly perception are concrete and drive her choices; the exchange of the brooch is a micro-choice that reveals values, and her final shift to vigil is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. driven observation) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as wakefulness becomes vigil. Orientation is clear early; the tidal constraint and insomnia shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal island is indispensable, constraining choice via tide timing and charging the final image of its disappearance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's painterly POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) escalates through Maren's agency—painting, exchanging the brooch—with cost legible in the brooch's surrender and the repriced wakefulness. Time pressure from the tide tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from convergence of preservation, war, and insomnia without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of vigil and the painting's "wry earnestness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, painterly perceptual signature. Dialogue (fisherman) is natural and goal-driven; voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and cohesive. Sentences advance story and character simultaneously; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, psychological, and artistic elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (amber brooch, tidal island) are irreplaceable.</comment>
