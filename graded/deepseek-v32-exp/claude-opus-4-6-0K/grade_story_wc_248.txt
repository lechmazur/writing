<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (grief/rage) are embodied in scene; her final choice to catalog and open the archive is earned by the mother's message with visible cost—the sacrifice of the self-portrait and her emotional release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (from arsonist to curator) with felt cost on-page in the decoded message and her kneeling; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive environment constrains choice and charges the final image—the tapestry fragment and stone shelves pressure Maren's discovery and reconfiguration of purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maren's agency following the artistic trail; stakes tighten to a personal reckoning with cost legible in her "shaking hands" and the portrait's sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief/tenderness emerges through particulars (fires, archive, message); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, via the image of opening the locked door.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive"); poetic prose reflects Maren's consciousness without head-hopping; elision (the cipher) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("volcanic tenderness") is consistent and heightens closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist and hidden archive tropes through specific, grounded choices; emotional truth and risk-taking in lyric prose yield inevitable transformation.</comment>
