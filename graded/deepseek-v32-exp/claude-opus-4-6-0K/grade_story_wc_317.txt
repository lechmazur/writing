<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's receptivity and suspicion are concretely embodied; her final choice to call is earned by prior clues and her professional ethos, with visible cost in risking trust. The internal contradiction between curiosity and isolation is subtle but legible, though the emotional progression remains quiet, holding back the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (opening to collaboration) with felt cost in the risk undertaken. The corpse flower seed realization provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options and propels the call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and charges the final image (the brook’s flow mirrors continuity), but it does not constrain choice, capping below 9.0. Sensory details ("sky scrubbed raw," "storm-born silence") are filtered through Lena's contemplative state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation vs. suspicion) escalates through Lena's agency as she deciphers clues; the corpse flower seed forces a decisive choice with cost legible in "the weight of a possibility just born." One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patient innovation emerges through concrete particulars (seeds, notes, brook) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the call and flowing water, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in Lena's mindset. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high-density, with rhythmic control and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("storm-born silence") is purposeful and clear; sentences advance character, plot, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise (escape room designer receives botanical puzzle) is a fresh synthesis; details (corpse flower seed, pop-up rooms) are specific and organic. Risk-taking in quiet, contemplative closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
