<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unit-7's interiority is concretely rendered through machine-like perception and philosophical yearning; the final shift from obsessive question to resonant acceptance is earned by the violin-playing action and carries visible cost in the melting instrument and continued sweeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (loop ends) via a causal chain (violin playing amalgamates ghost-data) with felt cost (loss of the violin, quiet continuation); orientation is immediate, and the lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard is both constraint and resource, generating the ice violin that charges the climax; sensory detail (crackling rime, luminous note) is selective and purposeful, filtered through Unit-7’s analytical yet poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integration/answer) escalates through Unit-7’s agency in picking up and playing the violin, which narrows options and culminates in a legible cost (the violin’s dissolution) that reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (origin of thought as thought itself) emerges through the recursive loop and the violin’s resonance; the ending offers a non‑literal, earned answer via the concrete image of sweeping water, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a voice that blends mechanical precision and lyrical observation; no dialogue, but the perceptual signature (noticing temperature, density, then pull) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero scaffold or loops; figurative language (“sound of a freezer humming in an empty kitchen”) is precise and enhances closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of robot consciousness, time‑loop pressure, and mundane mysticism; the ice violin as key feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its premise without gimmickry.</comment>
