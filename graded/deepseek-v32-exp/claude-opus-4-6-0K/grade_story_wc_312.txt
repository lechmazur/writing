<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cael's interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his lukewarm magic and earnest naivety drive the resolution with visible cost in the bell's scar and his relieved weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal plot tight, orientation immediate, closure lands with cost as the bell mends imperfectly but effectively, steadying the world; lens holds and constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct and dripping rates are not just backdrop but constrain choice and charge the final image, integrated through POV perception; environment essential to outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of cosmic imbalance escalate through Cael's agency; cost legible in the scarred bell and his relieved weeping; one meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragility and devotion emerges through specifics like the bell's crack; ending reweights without moralizing, leaving resonant plausibility in "the impossible had been plausible."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable, voice poetic yet grounded in Cael's perception, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure; no head-hopping, distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of lukewarm mage saving world through patience is fresh; synthesis of elements feels inevitable, risk in quiet resolution pays off with emotional specificity.</comment>
