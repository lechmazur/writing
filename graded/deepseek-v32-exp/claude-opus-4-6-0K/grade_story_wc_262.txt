<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Maren's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to project the film and add her own letter. The final choice is earned by prior causality, though the visible cost is subtle—more implied than dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the final image reweights the premise with undeniable cost ("a ghost of light that refused to fully disappear"). Orientation is immediate, causality clean, and the pattern of discovery tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. The projection booth's sensory details (cellulose, dust, heat) are filtered through POV and constrain action—the projector and film strip are indispensable to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) is signaled early and escalates through Maren's agency—reading letters, discovering film, projecting it. Cost is legible in the final realization and the faint glow on the screen, reweighting options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—love unexpressed migrates into objects and places. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the glowing screen and Maren's letter, avoiding moralizing while recharging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity; purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "hushed thunder") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, accelerating toward closure. Information density is high, and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes psychometry, vintage cinema, and metaphysical love into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in lyrical, quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. The story commits fully to its concept, making the ending feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
