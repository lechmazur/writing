<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure; her final choice to stay is earned by prior causality as a translator, with visible cost in her commitment to Suki.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise as Lena stays, reconfiguring meaning under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the image of reef on plaster, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric; the brain coral and cast function as micro-settings that charge the final image, constraining choice and deepening resonance without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency in decrypting the cast, tightening stakes under the accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in her emotional response and decision to stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from concrete actions and images; subtext in the smudged notes and final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a consistent perceptual signature; POV is stable, and lyrical compression supports pressure without head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and enhances closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes translation, trauma, and healing through specific details like brain coral and dialect notes; risk-taking in quiet lyricism pays off with inevitable closure.</comment>
