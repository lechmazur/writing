<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's interior contradiction (fury vs. love) is embodied in scene; her final choice of the angriest letter is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The "fierce tenderness" realization is character-particular and drives a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (vulnerability of sending the raw letter). Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (find shard, read messages, send letter) links because/therefore. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth constrains navigation and choice; the gargoyle shard as a micro-setting object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Lira's urgent, haunted perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) escalates via agency: the shard's messages force Lira's response. The tightening—choosing the earliest, angriest letter—forecloses the option of continued silence with a clear, on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (healing through vulnerable acknowledgment) emerges organically from images (shard healing in moonlight, unsent letters). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of the moon "healing every shadow it touched."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, metaphor-rich but controlled. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "fierce tenderness that almost buckled her knees") and maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and information density is high without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical elements (singing spirits, healing shard) with emotional realism (unsent letters). The premise feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
