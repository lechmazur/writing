<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; her motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is dramatized through actions like humming and adjusting speed. Passengers' emotional shifts are embodied without label-speak. No contradictions or unearned epiphanies; final understanding earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure with Charged Poise as silence teaches Sable; cost legible in the final image. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with persistent constraints (storm glass vial, noise monitoring) shaping tactics. Orientation clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (drifting prism terrace) is integral, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "slow-moving rainbows" are selective and purposeful. The vial and noise levels function as micro-settings that pressure Sable's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are emotional transformation; escalation driven by Sable's agency in catalyzing silence through adjustments and humming. Cost unmistakable in the clearing of the vial and passenger shifts. Fits accumulative lens with meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through passage emerges naturally from particulars like the vial and crossing; subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; conceptual cost in Sable's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV stable third-person limited to Sable; voice distinct with lyrical prose and perceptual signature in her monitoring of frequencies. No head-hopping; diction consistent and rhythm controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "silver nerves") is clear and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of emotional catalysis via gondola crossing is fresh and specific; synthesis of elements feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; originality in detail and perspective.</comment>
