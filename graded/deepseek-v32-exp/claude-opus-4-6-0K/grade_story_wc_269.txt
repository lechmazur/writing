<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied interiority and clear motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test. Maren's endurance and revelation are earned with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost on-page ("tethered to a wound"). Orientation is anchored early, and causality from data assembly to revelation is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the atlas page and tapping ritual function as micro-settings that constrain attention and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in data, leading to a revelation driven by Maren's agency with unmistakable cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the atlas page and bleaching witness; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise, reflecting Maren's scientific mindset, and rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate change through specific, grounded details like tide data and tapping ritual; turns feel earned, and risk-taking in quiet internal focus heightens stakes.</comment>
