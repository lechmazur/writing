<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority concrete with embodied emotion; final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost in weeping. Her guilt and redemption are dramatized without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with charged poise as names echo and she weeps, cost legible in melt and grief; orientation clear early; single scene with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice sanctum and aurora constrain choice (light as tuning guide) and charge final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful, woven through action with POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) escalates via her agency under accumulative lens; cost felt in weeping and melt; one meaningful tightening as she rebraids with light feedback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of destruction/creation and memory emerges through particulars like rope and scrap; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in punched card analogy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice poetic but controlled; no head-hopping; elision taught (punched card logic) and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and clear; rhythm varies naturally; no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lost wax casting, transcribed memory, and ice sanctum feels organic; specific detail avoids tropes; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
