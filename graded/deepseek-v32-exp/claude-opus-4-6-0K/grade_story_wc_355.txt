<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire to understand) acting simultaneously. Her final choice to open the diary is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in her weeping. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Maren reconfigures her mother's silence as love, and the final image of weeping fireworks makes the cost undeniable. The Accumulative lens holds, with pattern of silence cataloging tightening to the diary opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The open-roof workshop and the diary are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "constellations pulsed," "shadows pooled"). Spatial choreography is coherent and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her mother's silence) is signaled early and escalates via Maren's agency in using tuning forks and opening the diary. The cost is legible in the final catalog entry and weeping. One meaningful tightening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence, listening, and unspoken love emerges through particulars (notebook entries, diary excerpts). The final realization—"the silence of being loved without knowing it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the mother's entries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Maren's perceptual signature. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., the scaffold of tuning forks). No dialogue, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is flawlessly crafted: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "ribs of some gentle beast"). No artifacts; clarity and propulsion are maintained through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cataloging silence, tuning forks, and fireworks hush feels inevitable. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking (quiet climax, lyrical intensity) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
