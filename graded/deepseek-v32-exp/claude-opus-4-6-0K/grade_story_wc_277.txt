<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marguerite's characterization is precise: her "devotedly observant" trait and internal conflict between legacy and truth are embodied in her handling of the pen nib and reading the logbooks. The final choice to publish everything is earned by the causality of her discoveries and her father's recorded regrets, with the cost felt as the pen nib presses "like a small, insistent question" against her heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she chooses to "let the truth complete its long, elliptical path home," reframing the legacy with visible cost (the final valley/image and the press bearing the Bellwood name). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of orbits/regret taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting is atmospheric and functionally pressures choice (the isolation, the logbooks). The rosewood pen nib and the logbooks act as micro-settings that constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marguerite's POV (e.g., "silence echoed against stone walls, making her breathing sound liturgical").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. family reputation) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through Crane's arrival and the documents. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to "run it all" is a decisive tightening that forecloses the option of suppression, with cost legible in the final image of the clouds closing over the valley and the printing plant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of elliptical truth and regret emerges organically from the logbooks and the astronomical metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marguerite's reframing ("Let people see the whole orbit"), integrating the core concept without moralizing. The father's proof by contradiction is earned as a specific, character- particular method of reckoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature ("silence echoed... making her breathing sound liturgical"). Dialogue is economical and goal-driven (Crane's revelation). The voice's solemn playfulness is consistent, though a slight register elevation in descriptive passages ("liturgical") is voice-motivated and does not break clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with vivid imagery ("like a cathedral abandoned by its god"). Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene needs. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph achieves high information density and a clear, resonant cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical observation with journalistic legacy and personal regret feels fresh and inevitable. The "orbits of regret" concept transforms a familiar corruption plot through specific, grounded choices in character and motif. Risk-taking in structure (interleaving logbook entries) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
