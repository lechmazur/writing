<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her blithe exterior contrasts with her secret, weighty work, creating credible interiority. The final choice to take the tapestry to the archivist is earned by prior decoding actions with visible cost in the realization of her grandmother's silencing. Emotions are embodied (e.g., "feeling the cold seep through her wool coat like an old friend"), and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: finding the case leads to decoding, which escalates to the climactic discovery and decision. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (chess clock, cobalt silo, Marguerite). Closure is a decisive change—she will act on the evidence—with cost legible in the sentence "Celia had been silenced and buried without a marker." The tapestry as a persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful: the cobalt silo, open roof framing stars, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective (starlight "falling in a pale column that touched nothing warmly") and filtered through Marguerite's POV, integrating with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth about Celia) escalates through Marguerite's agency in decoding the tapestry, culminating in a tightening discovery that forecloses ignorance. Cost is felt in the velveteen gloom and the realization of silencing. Under the causal lens, the escalation is driven by protagonist choice, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth, memory, and making "something gentle grow in a place shaped by loss." Subtext operates through imagery (tapestry as encoded ledger, roses over graves). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Marguerite's hummed tune and the uncharted echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, precise prose reflecting Marguerite's mindset. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., from cold seep to velveteen gloom). Elision (like the chess clock ritual) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "The velveteen gloom of the silo pressed close, soft and suffocating"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific: a tapestry as a stitched ledger of dispossession, decoded through color-coded threads. Tropes are transformed through grounded details (sovereign case, silo, cemetery setting). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
