<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, her interiority embodied through specific actions and perceptions. The final choice to sing is earned by the buildup, though internal contradiction is underplayed, slightly limiting the peak. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concretely filtered through the setting and her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the ghost's smile and the "silence that felt full." The lightning-thunder interval acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard, lightning, and bolt plate are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through Lira's POV. The setting is not backdrop but an active participant that shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of articulation and connection escalate via the lightning-triggered message and Lira's agency in singing. Under the accumulative lens, a decisive cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with unmistakable cost: the ghost's desperation resolves into peaceful stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken need and artistic connection emerges entirely through concrete images and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—shared language as a "lantern holds its flame"—without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the encoded graffiti and the ghost's plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice that modulates beautifully under pressure. The poetic rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, enhancing the accumulative texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and flawlessly controlled. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, advancing story and atmosphere with zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, and line-level propulsion matches the story's cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-in-code, balladeer, and encoded graffiti feels organic and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with specific, lived detail that transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
