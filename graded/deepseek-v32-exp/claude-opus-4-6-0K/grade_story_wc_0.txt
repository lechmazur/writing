<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of preprocessing is earned by prior causality (butterfly, dust patterns) with visible cost—accepting humility and gradual change. Contradictory impulses (efficiency vs. presence) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: humility as willingness to be a pattern in the dust. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint (dust, greenhouse) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (storm-damaged greenhouse) and micro-setting (dust, butterfly wing) pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through POV bias (scientific to poetic). Environment constrains tactics and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: observations of dust patterns and butterfly decay deepen stakes, leading to a decision to stop preprocessing. Cost is legible in the final image (humility, carrying the greenhouse). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (gradual change, decay as revelation) emerges through particulars (neutron star, marriage, butterfly) without moralizing. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific lexicon and poetic observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (preprocessing) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pace. Closure image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and flood-damaged greenhouse feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, non-obvious angle transforms familiar material (healing, decay) through grounded detail. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
