<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and driven by a credible, layered motivation: her bone-setter's need for certainty and her unresolved grief for her daughter. Her final choice—to believe in the sound beneath the roots—is earned by the preceding accumulation of sensory detail and personal revelation. The micro-choice to pocket the tooth and "listen" demonstrates a hierarchy of values where faith becomes a tool for mending. A slight deduction for a moment of near-diagnostic clarity ("permission to forgive herself") though it is quickly anchored back in embodied metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is strong and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren chooses to believe, crystallizing her new stance that "some fractures ask to be set with faith." The cost is legible in the final image—her kneeling, listening for an unverifiable sound, foreclosing her old path of pure skepticism. Orientation is immediate, pattern taught early, and the final reconfiguration reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is essential and constrains choice: the impossible garden forces Maren's epistemic shift. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional POV (feeling the tooth "the way she felt bones"). The garden is not a postcard but a crucible that charges the final image, its roses turning as she listens. Spatial choreography is clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal: restoring wholeness after loss) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening: the discovery of the tooth reweights her understanding of certainty and grants "permission." Her agency—to choose belief—forecloses her former skeptical path with a visible cost of accepting the unverifiable. No coincidental resolution; the turn is driven by her confrontation with the garden's reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (certainty vs. faith, fracture vs. healing) emerges organically from concrete particulars—bone setting, the tooth, the garden. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: faith as a method of setting fractures. Subtext is rich in image and gesture (the tooth as a "word misspelled"). No moralizing; the thematic reconfiguration is earned through Maren's specific struggle and final charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, deeply embedded in Maren's perception. Voice has a distinct, measured, tactile texture fitting her profession. Diction remains within her lexicon ("cleft in her certainty," "navigate by constellations"). No head-hopping. The lyric compression in the garden sequence is purposeful and pattern-taught, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high; most sentences advance character and atmosphere. Minor artifact: a slight register elevation in "permission to forgive herself" feels momentarily summary-like, but it is quickly re-anchored. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling folklore with the deeply personal metaphor of bone-setting is fresh and feels inevitable. The core concept ("a cleft in certainty") is transformed through specific, grounded character work. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
