<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (pressing mica, swaddling, singing). The final endurance—she will forget but her throat remembers—is earned and carries cost. Interior contradiction is minimal but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: dawn woven, but Maren's memory will reset. The song's contagion and root-network payoff are taught and land cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and pressures choices: the mica window splits light/sound, the orchard's decay forces action. The greenhouse and its objects constrain tactics and charge the final image of unspooled dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (rekindling realm) escalate via Maren's agency—singing unlocks the dawn. Under accumulative lens, density intensifies through song refraction and community response. Cost is legible: cyclical forgetting despite renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, community, and cyclical renewal emerge through concrete images (dawn-child, song in throat). Ending offers a non-literal answer: renewal via embodied memory, not conscious recall. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV, stable and distinct. Lyrical voice mirrors Maren's scattered memory; perceptual signature is selective ("memories arrived like scattered seeds"). Rhythm controls pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent. Read-aloud flow is smooth; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: woven dawns, memory keeper with scattered memory, song as contagion. Synthesis feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision, no template echoes.</comment>
