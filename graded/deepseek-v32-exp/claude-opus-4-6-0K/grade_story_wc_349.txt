<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in parole-wiped history; interiority is concrete via journal and stylus, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses in scene. Final endurance is earned by prior causality with cost in borrowed freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (search reconfigured as "one void closer") with cost legible in "freedom was borrowed light" and pulsed parole. Orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (glass orchard, clouds) is vivid and selective; micro-setting (journal, stylus) constrains choice and charges final image. Sensory detail purposeful, filtered through POV's analytical eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find origin of stories) deepens via accumulative density; agency in recording spiral and waiting forecloses path with cost in parole. One meaningful tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory, forgetting, and origin emerges through particulars like spiral voids and bottled moonlight; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice is lyrical and precise with distinct perceptual signature (quantifying absence). No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like dust on a sill") is consistent and clear, enhancing closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of clean-slate vendor and parole is fresh synthesis; risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Details feel inevitable and indispensable.</comment>
