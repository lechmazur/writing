<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, with interiority concrete via embodied perception (e.g., "burden of legacy like a stone sewn into her chest"). Her final choice—to continue deeper—is earned by prior causality and shows contradictory impulses on the page, with visible cost in isolation and obsession. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren's decision to follow the sound reconfigures stakes with cost felt on-page ("knowing it might brand her with the same obsession"). Causal lens holds tightly from entry to discovery to choice. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the persistent constraint of legacy shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-bearing: the ivy-veiled passage requires machete work, and the lecture hall's fireplace yields diaries that constrain choice. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "cold air that smelled of char and rain"). The tuning rod and film negative function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy vs. self-preservation) escalates through Maren's agency: finding the diaries deepens knowledge and forces the closure choice. Cost is legible in her acknowledgment of potential obsession. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and legacy emerges through concrete particulars—echoes, diaries, waveform patterns—without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "walls dreaming" and the final resonant image of following sound. Ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Maren's sensitivity. Voice is lyrical yet precise, e.g., "listening for what walls dream about." No head-hopping; rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and character-motivated ("vibrating at a frequency just below grief"). Information density high; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of echo cartography is fresh and transformed through specific, grounded details. Emotional truth in legacy burden avoids template plots. Risk-taking in speculative concept heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
