<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through concrete actions and patient interiority. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the cold and solitude. Minor deduction for a lack of sharp internal contradiction in scene, but micro-choices under pressure reveal a credible hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ancient methods "refuse to disappear," with cost legible in the silent, ongoing effort. The persistent constraint of fading knowledge shapes the entire tactile decoding, and the final image reweights the stake without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, filtered through Maren's professional perception. The golden dock, snow, fog, and rope are integrated into action and pressure. The rope as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, where the knots keep speaking beneath the covering snow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation) is signaled early and escalates through Maren's decoding agency under the Accumulative lens. The match of the herring-migration pattern deepens knowledge and raises urgency. Cost is visible in the cold, patience, and the race against silence, charging the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges organically from concrete particulars (seeds, knots, fulgurite). Subtext operates through image and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the methods' refusal to disappear—without moralizing, reweighting prior material through a quiet, costly persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical, philosophical voice. Perception is consistently filtered through Maren's expertise and patience. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure. Elision (e.g., the secret weavers' history) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsion is maintained through varied syntax and selective detail. High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed collector and knot decoder is fresh and organic. The concept of tactile language encoded in knots feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure effect remains legible and resonant.</comment>
