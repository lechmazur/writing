<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are vividly embodied; final burning earned by prior static and devotion, with visible cost in loss of physical proof.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure with charged poise as she burns fears, cost legible in "miniaturized by the act of letting go" and new north.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain action (UV lamps for burning) and charge final image; sensory detail selective and filtered through Maren's synthetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake is Maren's inner static; escalation through magnetic shift and memory surges leads to agency-driven burning with clear cost in forfeiture of tangible connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of love, memory, and containment emerges from particulars; ending image of "strangely whole, beautifully fragmented" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice poetic with distinct perceptual signature of synthetic caretaker; no head-hopping; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and advances story; high information density with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia, childhood fears, and magnetic shift; risk in quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
