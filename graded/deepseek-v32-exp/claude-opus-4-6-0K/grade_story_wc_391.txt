<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in witnessed trauma; her interior conflict between impatience and patience is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, culminating in an earned shift to deliberate slowness that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with on-page cost as she crosses the viaduct with sabotaged maps, the persistent constraint of lunar navigation shaping tactics, and the final image of ice formation reconfiguring the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are not merely backdrop but actively constrain her method and timing; the viaduct’s residual moisture and the ice’s reflection charge the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through her nightly labor and internal struggle; the dominant stake of liberating territory tightens as she completes the maps, with cost legible in her forged patience and the risk of return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges through the moon’s indifference and the ice metaphor; subtextual weight in mapping as power avoids moralizing, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through her cartographer’s precision; voice is distinct, lyrical yet controlled, with perceptual signature shaping every observation and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsionary without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("organ built for a god who preferred silence") is consistent and heightens atmosphere, and rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of cartographic sabotage is fresh and specific; synthesis of mapping, lunar navigation, and quiet revolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the slow-burn plot heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
