<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is concrete and specific, driving her to the Caldwell house. Her epiphany on the porch—that the house is alive because it remembers love—is earned by prior accumulation, and her decision to add her own prayer is a micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance (commitment to participate) is a credible endurance with felt cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the change is deeply motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens, taught early and held. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Maren reinterprets the house from haunted to loved, with cost legible in her pledge to return and contribute. The single scene builds through patterned detail to a decisive reconfiguration. No orientation debt; the pattern pays off at the end with a resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and filtered through Maren's perceptive bias; the Caldwell house and its porch function as micro-setting that charges the final image. The "shard of hush" and the daydreaming hour atmosphere are integral to the realization. Environment constrains choice (the porch is the site of epiphany) and shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the houses) escalates via accumulation of displacements and the orris root return, culminating in Maren's agency-driven epiphany. The cost is legible in her commitment to add her own object, foreclosing her prior passive observation. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens reweights the stake with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sanctification through repetition emerges organically from concrete images (doorknob, shoe, orris root) and the final realization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a living house was not haunted. It was loved"—without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence and gesture, and the conceptual repricing reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice that mirrors Maren's attentive perception. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and purposeful. The "shard of hush" elision is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: sentences are dense and rhythmic, advancing character and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like half-formed thoughts," "a shard of hush") is precise and consistent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; prose propulsion matches the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific—houses made alive by collected prayers of daily objects—transforming the haunted-house trope through grounded, lyrical detail. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in quiet, contemplative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Originality arises from character-specific perception and thematic resonance.</comment>
