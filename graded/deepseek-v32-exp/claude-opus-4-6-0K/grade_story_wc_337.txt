<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied ("silence ... a physical weight"), and her contradictory impulses—guarding her secret versus accepting help—act in scene. The final renunciation of her solitary burden is earned by Elin's steady presence and the shared work, with cost visible in her first audible exhale. Elin applies secondary pressure by asking the pivotal question, forcing a choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the silence becomes "a clearing" and Maren's hum signals a decisive shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as voices release and silence disperses. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight. Cost is legible in the "low, unsteady hum" and the reconfigured weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is integral, filtering starlight and transforming released voices into colored light, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (the net like "shed skin"). The setting constrains action through the crystal columns and stone floor, grounding the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren's burden of silence; escalation occurs when Elin arrives and Maren must share her secret, tightening options. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens with each unraveled knot. Agency drives the turn, and cost is felt in the dispersal of silence and Maren's regained voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Themes of silence, burden, and shared release emerge organically from concrete actions and images. Subtext operates in gesture (Elin's smile "its own kind of gift") and the final resonant image of the "clearing." No moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal, hopeful reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptual signature (noticing "pale rivers of color," the net's "hardened fibers"). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("silence ... like silt"). Sentence variety supports momentum; closure image is clear and resonant. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (mask restorer, interlaced hush, net of drowned voices) feels organic and inevitable. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and emotional specificity. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
