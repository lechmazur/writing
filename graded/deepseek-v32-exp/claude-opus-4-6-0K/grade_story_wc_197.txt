<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and earned change from invisibility to reappearance. However, internal contradiction is minimal, which slightly limits depth under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands on-page with cost as she broadcasts and reappears. Orientation is early and clear, and persistent constraint of invisibility shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details; puddles and lagoon constrain choices and charge the final image. Environment actively shapes her path and the climax's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by her agency after plans unravel; cost of reappearance is legible and tightens stakes. Dominant stake of resisting indifference coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resisting indifference emerges organically from events; ending offers resonant non-literal answer through transmission and reappearance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects her observant nature. No head-hopping, and voice remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Polished, high-density prose with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revised histories and counter-archive; phone booth network and puddle reflections are inventive and integral, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
