<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens; the magnetic grotto scene reconfigures the town's unspoken words with felt cost. Orientation is immediate, causality intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are not just vivid backdrops; they constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposefully filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
