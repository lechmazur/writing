<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Characters are deeply motivated; Maren's transformation from protector to builder is earned through concrete interactions with Caul, whose multifaceted personality adds complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot structure is tight; closure with Maren distributing poems reconfigures the stakes with visible cost—the lost bookshop versus the spread beauty—under a consistent causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library setting is not just vivid but essential, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "stars poured through the absent rafters" are filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal service to societal rebuilding; Maren's agency drives the escalation, and the cost is legible in the replacement of the bookshop with a parking garage adorned with poems.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "blooming resistance" emerges organically from character actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of poems on concrete, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with a lyrical, distinct voice; dialogue is natural and advances plot, and the perceptual signature is consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prison library, vagrant poet, and resistance themes; specific details and risk-taking in lyrical prose heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
