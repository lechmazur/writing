<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction (delicate woman in giant gear, migrating identities) is concrete and drives micro-choices; her final stance of staying and choosing wonder is earned by the causal build of acceptance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (endurance in timelessness). Orientation is clear early; the pattern of contradiction and wonder tightens to the final image of holding the folio in the rising tide, reconfiguring meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is indispensable: it constrains choices (tides, grates, submerged stacks) and charges the final image (water, light, floating folio). Sensory details are selective, filtered through Maren's perception, and woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder against sameness) escalate via the rising tide and her decision to stay; cost is legible in her acceptance of fluctuating self and timeless day. Under accumulative lens, density increases and final image reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (wonder through acceptance of contradiction) emerges from particulars (gear, creel, moon phases) without moralizing; the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature (noticing tidal rhythms, light, contradiction) is consistent. No head-hopping; elision (the condition's backstory) is anchored in present cues and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and artifact-free; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion matches the contemplative yet charged pace, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tidal library, stopped time, and migrating identities feels inevitable; risk-taking (quiet accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic and transformative.</comment>
