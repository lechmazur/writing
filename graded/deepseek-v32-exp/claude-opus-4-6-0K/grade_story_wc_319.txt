<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Guardian's feral intellect and dimensional homesickness are embodied in concrete, contradictory impulses (leaving vs. guarding). The final renunciation—placing the pendant back—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her continued, reconfigured waiting. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and pressurized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is an Earned Stasis (she stays, making waiting a home) with cost legible in the final image of the pendant on the frozen arc. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the pendant's discovery triggers a coherent internal turn that deepens without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail (frost, ink, cold breath) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action. The environment actively pressures her decision and becomes inseparable from her perimeter-guardian role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (leave/stay) is signaled early and tightens via the pendant's discovery. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of thematic conflict driven by her agency; cost is unmistakable in her foregone chance at a dimension with three light boundaries, reconfigured into a resonant endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (making friends with uncertainty, waiting as home) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the pendant, the light boundaries, the frozen garden. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the homesickness becomes "a room she could furnish," a conceptual repricing with felt cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical, philosophical, and perfectly matched to the feral guardian's perception. Diction and syntax ("feral the way a theorem is feral") create a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with varied sentence rhythms and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, advancing atmosphere and character. Information density is high; every sentence serves story, character, or atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a feral librarian, dimensional homesickness, and waiting as a technology feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and bold lyrical risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template reliance or derivative echoes.</comment>
