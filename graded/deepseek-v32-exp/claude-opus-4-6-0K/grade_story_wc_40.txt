<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation and endurance are earned, with contradictory impulses of grief and dedication shaping a resonant closure. No diagnostic label-speak; the final stasis is credible and cost-legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation immediate; accumulative lens holds tightly. Closure is a charged poise with felt cost (loss of language, years of study); the library's sonic reflectiveness persistently shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The library and crystal function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's scholarly POV with atmospheric precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density of pattern and Maren's attentive agency; cost is felt in the foreclosed path of the old world and the earned stasis of attention as enough. Agency drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action; the ending reweights prior material with a non-literal answer that values growth and attention without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence and light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical and controlled with a consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful; closure image is clear and uncluttered. High information density with zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesis feels inevitable; risk of a quiet, reflective story pays off with emotional specificity and conceptual integrity. The crystal and silence are transformed through grounded particulars.</comment>
