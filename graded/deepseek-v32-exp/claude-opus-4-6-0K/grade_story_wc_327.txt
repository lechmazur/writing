<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but internal conflict and contradictory impulses are absent, limiting depth. The change is earned, but cost is conceptual rather than emotionally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (language transformed, not lost). Persistent constraint (diamond's curse) shapes tactics, and the ending lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with bone towers and echoes essential to the translation process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving language) escalate through protagonist's agency; the translation succeeds at the cost of the language becoming a vibration encoded in her body, reweighting the initial loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of language transformation emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, inviting reflection on preservation and medium.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, third-person limited POV is stable and distinct; perceptual signature is strong, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and no loops or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (copper veins, cursed diamond, bone towers, birds) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design pays off with clarity and stakes heightened.</comment>
