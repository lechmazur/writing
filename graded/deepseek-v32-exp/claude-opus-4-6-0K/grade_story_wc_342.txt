<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren's prosopagnosia and pursuit of precision are concretely embodied; her internal conflict culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No contradictions or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in "It was enough to have tried." Orientation anchored early, structure tight, persistent constraint of time and limit shapes tactics.</comment>
