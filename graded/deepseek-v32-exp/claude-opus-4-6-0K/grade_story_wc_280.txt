<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as an encore-seeking ghost is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete through synesthetic perception, and her final bow is an earned endurance with visible cost—"that was encore enough." No contradictions or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the orchard's applause. Orientation is immediate, and the fractured timeline constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's synesthesia, with sensory details like "wind through the branches played in violet chords." The orchard actively constrains her performance and charges the final image with the standing ovation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (desire for an encore) escalate accumulatively via echoing and intertwining; agency is clear as Elara initiates the performance, leading to a legible cost in the reconfiguration of her despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from fractured time and artistic longing; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the orchard's applause, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with a perceptual signature ("sound as color") and rhythmic control that heightens pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, fractured timeline, and synesthesia feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
