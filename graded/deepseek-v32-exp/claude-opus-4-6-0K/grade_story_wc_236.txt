<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is concrete and particular, with her loss of smell and patient hands shaping her micro-choices. Her final acceptance is earned by the causality of the screw discovery and Sera's reaction, with visible cost in her lost sense. The emotional terrain mapping is an embodied, non-diagnostic skill that replaces her former language of scent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building to a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lena's realization that her new ability is "enough" lands with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the birthing screw discovery tightens the pattern and charges the closure image of the thinning fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The water clock shop and the fog are vivid, purposeful, and constrain choice—the clocks are the medium for Lena's mapping. The birthing clamp screw, seen through occluded light, charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lena's POV, with smell appropriately absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Lena's search for connection after loss. Escalation is driven by her agency in identifying the screw and interpreting its story, which deepens her realization. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's "trembling calm" and the foreclosed path of her aromatherapy career.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the screw, the fog, the water clocks. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that reading emotional terrain can substitute for lost scent—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the velvet pouch, Sera's weeping) and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Lena) is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, reflective perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (the frosted glass metaphor) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("like a living thing," "frosted glass") is purposeful and coherent. The final image achieves clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of aromatherapist losing smell and water clock repair feels organic and inevitable. The quiet, accumulative design is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept of reading emotional terrain in objects is fresh and specific.</comment>
