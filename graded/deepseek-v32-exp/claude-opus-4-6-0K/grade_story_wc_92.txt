<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s vigilance and inventive calm are consistently embodied through on-page micro-choices (reading the sundial by amber glow, adjusting locks). Motivation is clear and rooted in eleven years of guarded knowledge, compelling her higher-stakes action. However, no contradictory impulses act in scene; her determination is unwavering, which slightly limits interior complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout triggers coded message, which leads to lock adjustments that redirect the light. Closure is a decisive change (rewiring completed) with conceptual cost (risk and systemic shift) felt in the final image of the fort gleaming anew. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph, and the sundial dead-drop pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (phosphor-veined fort, courtyard, half-painted sundial) is vividly filtered through Maren’s professional attention and actively constrains choice—the blackout enables her move, and the sundial’s cipher directly shapes the plot. The final image of light forking downward charges the closure with tangible atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution to redirect light) is signaled early and tightens during the blackout. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she reads the code and adjusts locks, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual and implied rather than viscerally paid on the page, but the final reconfiguration of the light system carries undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet systemic rewiring emerges organically from concrete images (phosphor-veins, sundial cipher, “Cradle of Sparks”) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: the undercity waking to light. No moralizing; subtext operates through winking walls and unfinished art as patient resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and distinct, with a conspiratorial, lyrical voice that modulates with pressure (“the fort held its breath”). No head‑hopping; perceptual signature is selective and professional, and the prose’s rhythmic control heightens the hush of the revolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language (“walls threaded with phosphor‑veins,” “hush that felt almost conspiratorial”) is precise and integrated. Information density is high, each sentence advancing story, character, or atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of infrastructure‑based revolution, coded sundial dead drop, and lock‑sentinel protagonist feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is grounded in specific, lived‑in detail (fort, undercity, phosphor‑veins) and commits fully to its premise of quiet rewiring, avoiding generic tropes.</comment>
