<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in concrete, embodied interiority; her micro-choice to imprint the memory of her father’s broken promise is earned and carries visible cost. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost ("the future he'd described collapsing into a single point of quiet"), and the persistent constraint of the forge shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the sunken greenhouse and aurora-powered forge constrain Elara’s method and charge the final image of the aurora singing green, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing aid for the girl) escalates through Elara’s agency—the memory of her father’s unbuilt bridge—and cost is felt in that recollection; one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration and finding beauty in damage emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the body remaking itself") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a strong perceptual signature (hearing colors as sound). Lyrical compression is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language remains coherent even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of absences, memory, and regeneration feels organic; the sunken greenhouse and ashen forge are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
