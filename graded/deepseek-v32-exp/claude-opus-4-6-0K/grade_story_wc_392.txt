<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's interior contradiction (compliance vs. integrity) is embodied in micro-choices; her final renunciation of silence is earned by the lantern's entangled memories and documented violations, with visible cost in facing Hargrove's fury.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain anchored by paragraph two; closure is a Charged Poise (decision to send the unredacted report) with cost felt in her anticipation of consequences; Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel and lantern are tactile and constraining; the lantern's star-pattern charges the final image as a witness, and the setting's history directly pressures Miriam's choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. career safety) escalates through Miriam's agency; one meaningful tightening (writing the full report) forecloses compliance with legible cost under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges through particulars (lantern, drought, ignored reports); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tunnel's released breath, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (empirical observation filtered through emotional weight); prose rhythm and sensory control heighten pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, polished prose with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear; sentence variety supports momentum, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of modern investigative procedural and historical resonance; the lantern as witness transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
