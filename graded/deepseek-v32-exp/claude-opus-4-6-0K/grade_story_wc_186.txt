<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maret's retrocognition and dedication are concrete; her hope "like a weed through cracked stone" embodies contradictory resilience. The final choice to wait is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern of star tracking and prism alignment leads to a Charged Poise closure with felt cost (hope's stubborn spine). The inferred lens holds, orientation is clear early, and closure lands on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is a cathedral made of breath; its humming panes and the beacon tower constrain choice and charge the final image with spectral light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (search for meaning in an empty world) tighten through Maret's active decoding; the coordinate revelation reweights her waiting with costly hope. Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of meaningful coincidence emerges through Eda's belief and the star paths; final image of waiting offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and color.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV filters through Maret's perception; prose rhythm matches the humming glass, no head-hopping, distinct texture. Voice is stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense, lyrical sentences advance story and atmosphere; no loops or artifacts; figurative language ("shard of hush") is precise and resonant. Information density is high, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, mystical, and scientific elements; the glass humming pavilion and retrocognition feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
