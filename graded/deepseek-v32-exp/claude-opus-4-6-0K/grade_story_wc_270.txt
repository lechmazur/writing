<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maret's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as "keeper of what grows," driving her to evolve tradition. Her interiority is concrete, and her final choice is earned by prior causality, though the personal cost is more conceptual than visceral, with no strong internal contradiction on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the amber dissolves, spreading genetic wisdom to all. The causal lens holds tightly from motivation to action, and the cost of reconfiguring tradition is legible in the image of "futures branching like root systems." Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are integral, constraining the ritual and charging the final image with sensory detail. Specificity like "sulfur lilies" and "thermophilic lichen" enriches the atmosphere and supports the theme, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evolving tradition—escalates through Maret's agency in decoding and performing the true ceremony. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the shift from imposed destiny to shared potential, though no personal cost is emphasized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between control and sharing, culminating in the resonant image of "a seed offered to open ground." Subtext operates through plant telepathy and the decoded script without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates with emotional intensity, as in "the sulfur lilies sang." Perception is filtered through Maret's biases, and dialogue is minimal but natural, with clear rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and no artifacts. Sentences advance story and character, and figurative language is consistent, e.g., "genetic material spiraled outward in luminous threads," maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of plant telepathy, amber embryos, and insurgent grandmotherhood feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the poetic style and transformation of tradition tropes heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, demonstrating originality.</comment>
