<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and resistance are embodied through specific micro-choices (ignoring origami, then tracing the stencil). Her final decision to draw is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, with interior contradiction handled in scene, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise (the curtain parting as she draws) with cost legible in the dead star’s light and her steady hand. Orientation is clear early; pattern taught via recurring images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (observatory, stencil, dead star) actively pressures choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s professional bias, avoiding ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, density increases through motifs; protagonist agency (taking the stencil, asking for ink) drives a meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in the final image of the dead star and her hand’s steadiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (genuine artifice, grief transmuted) emerges through concrete particulars and the final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Sable’s thematic dialogue is integrated, not a final-paragraph echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; perceptual signature distinct (mourning jeweler’s lens). Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (origami coordinates) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion varies with emotional beats. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry, astronomy, and tattoo art feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids template.</comment>
