<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pell's motivation is crystal clear and embodied in ink-stained fingers and pockets of language; his final act of sealing the jar is earned by the music box discovery, with cost visible in his isolation and the loft's decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise as Pell seals the jar labeled for the future; the accumulative/textural lens holds, with cost legible in the contrast between the dunes' burial and his rescue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The feral loft and glass jars constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like salt-warped timber and dune grass are selective and purposeful, filtered through Pell's poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving sounds escalate through Pell's agency in waiting and sealing; cost is felt in the slow burial outside versus his slow rescue inside, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and hope emerges without moralizing through the music box and jars; the final image reweights prior material with a resonant, non-literal answer to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical and consistent, with poetic perceptual signature; POV is stable, and rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "gleaned redemption" is precise and supports closure, with high information density and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of capturing sounds in jars is fresh and fully committed; synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
