<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete and his serene demeanor under pressure enables a credible micro-choice—transcribing the argument—that leads to his proposal. His epiphany, while slightly abstract, is earned by the argument’s heat and his silent processing. Secondary characters are functional but thin, which is acceptable at this length; the final choice to hand over authority is motivated and carries visible risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing that reweights the ethical premise; the decision to reverse storytelling authority lands with cost (“It might be terrible”). Orientation is clear within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the epiphany tightening the stakes and the story stick serving as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The radar dome is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (“slashes of coastal moonlight,” “electromagnetic noise”) and charges the final image of emptiness and reception. While it doesn’t directly constrain choice, it mirrors the theme and atmospherically pressures the scene, meeting the high-band requirement for environmental resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical integrity of art) escalates through Marcus’s agency: his epiphany deepens the conflict, and his proposal forecloses the prior path. The cost is legible in the group’s wary acceptance and the acknowledged risk of failure, satisfying the accumulative lens’s need for a decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the argument and epiphany, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the decision to hand over the story stick, reinforced by the final image of burning debris that illuminates “shapes already there.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct—urbane, measured, lyrical—with perceptual signature filtering through Marcus’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; dialogue is sparse but natural and goal‑driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats (“air before a meteor burns through atmosphere”). Sentence‑level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—ethical storytelling among subversive puppeteers—is fresh and synthesized with specific, irreplaceable elements (radar dome, story stick). Risk‑taking in the quiet, conceptual ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
