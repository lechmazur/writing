<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s stubborn persistence and Fen’s shift from enforcer to ally are rooted in concrete traits and micro-choices; the final choice is earned by the tactile demonstration with the tuning fork and ribbon, with cost legible in Fen’s acceptance of the Compact’s fury.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Maren’s actions force Fen’s realization and decision. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Fen’s filed claim) with on-page cost (“make the Compact furious”) and the persistent constraint of the trees holding the roof shapes the entire stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard is not just vivid backdrop—its vertical growth and structural dependency directly pressure choices and charge the final image of “the cathedral held.” Sensory details (fog, blossoms, shattered windows) are filtered through Maren’s professional eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the orchard) escalates through Maren’s agency: she reveals the structural dependency, narrowing Fen’s options. Cost is unmistakable in Fen’s decision to defy the Compact, foreclosing the easy eviction path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of persistence vs. deciduous contracts emerges through particulars (ribbon, tuning fork, fallen blossoms) without moralizing; the final image reweights prior material. Slight explicitness in “accidental wisdom” nudges down from a 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV remains anchored in Maren’s perceptive, lyrical voice; dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Fen’s sharpness, Maren’s metaphors). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language (“arthritic fingers,” “soft as shed contracts”) that advances character and atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; sentence-level propulsion supports the causal escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of arboreal anomaly, crystalline mending, and structural dependency feels inevitable; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
