<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s paradoxical condition and patient teaching are embodied through concrete micro-choices (withholding, guiding the trance) that reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. Cael’s grief and shifting understanding are earned via on-page pressure, and the final realization carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (dominant Accumulative/Textural) holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights vanishing and grief with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the delayed revelation pattern is taught early and pays off at the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto, floating rock, and pond are not just vivid backdrop—they constrain choice (platform rotation, trance alignment) and decisively charge the final image with starlight and spirals, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Cael’s grief/Lira’s teaching) tightens through a single meaningful deepening: the interference pattern revelation, driven by Lira’s agency, reweights options and delivers unmistakable emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (vanishing as redistribution, grief as misdirected attention) emerges organically from the pond‑ring metaphor and Lira’s condition; the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited primarily on Lira, with clean access to Cael’s experience; voice is distinct, poetic, and stable (“sycamore hush”), and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; figurative language (“like a held breath”) is purposeful and coherent; sentence‑level propulsion matches the trance’s cadence without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of backward aging, wave‑interference metaphysics, and grief therapy feels inevitable; risk‑taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise commits fully.</comment>
