<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oren's guilt is embodied through specific actions (kneeling at discoloration); his final choice to sing is earned by the bench discovery, with cost visible in breaking "unpardonable silence." Interior contradiction sustained without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via Charged Poise as Oren sings, reconfiguring meaning with cost in "unbearable courage of continuing." Orientation clear within 120 words, causality intact through discovery beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fortress and piano bench constrain choice and charge final image; sensory detail selective ("frost-covered window," "ice-cold wood") and filtered through Oren's perception, integrating setting with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes in Oren's internal conflict escalate via his agency (following bolt mark to bench); one meaningful tightening leads to decisive act with cost legible on page ("silence had been the wrong memorial").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of survival guilt emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "frostbitten hope," reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("seraphically mundane"); lyrical voice modulates with emotional pressure, no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent ("mechanical prayers," "ghost sensations"), advancing story with high information density, especially in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of survivor guilt in unique setting (cobalt fortress, nerve regeneration); turns feel inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
