<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vaelen's immortality and boredom are embodied in marrow-like weariness; his final renunciation is earned by dimensional awareness of other lives, with contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. empathy) acting in scene. Micro-choice to set down the fragment reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis with felt cost in "letting the boredom... settle like dust." Causal lens holds tightly: storm builds, fragment screams, Vaelen's awareness of billions of lives forces a choice. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and cursed fragment are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail ("walls hummed," "light fractured") is filtered through Vaelen's POV and integrated with action, shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover what comes after goodbye vs. destroy worlds) escalates under causal lens via solar storm's urgency. Vaelen's agency in setting down the fragment forecloses the path with cost legible on page in the weight of carrying goodbye.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Vaelen's immortality and curiosity; final realization that goodbye is "a weight to carry" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the fragment's scream and his vertigo of choosing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, measured prose reflects Vaelen's ancient, weary awareness. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "hushed thunder") and supports closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("silence weighed like stone") is consistent and purposeful; no artifacts obscure causality or closure. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes immortality, dimensional mutiny, and philosophical inquiry with fresh specificity. Tropes (cursed artifact, eternal being) are transformed through character-driven choice and quiet risk-taking, leading to an inevitable, earned ending.</comment>
