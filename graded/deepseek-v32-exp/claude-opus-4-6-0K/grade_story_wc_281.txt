<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; Maren's "affectionate skepticism" drives micro-choices under pressure, and her final call to Jonah is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her fragile hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is clear early; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "fragile, translucent hope," and the somatic marker constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver function as micro-settings that constrain choice (enabling the method) and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her perception) escalates through Maren's agency in devising the method; the photograph and call to Jonah tighten options with legible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the final image of the "tuning fork" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material on body as map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet concrete, and elision (e.g., somatic markers) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story with clarity, even in peak beats like the photograph reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of telepathy withdrawal and art; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the integration feels inevitable.</comment>
