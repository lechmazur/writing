<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is consistent and motivated, with embodied emotions and earned resolution; Marguerite's trait of listening drives key choices, and her final act of displaying the locket without opening the mailbox is credible. Minor lack of pronounced internal contradiction, but for this length, execution is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is early, structure coherent with neighborhood fragments leading to a charged poise. The mailbox as persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the courtyard and mailbox charging the final image; sensory details like "bruised orange light" are selective and filtered through POV. The mailbox functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating neighborhood stories under the accumulative lens, with protagonist agency in listening forcing a tightening when the outside world intrudes. Cost is legible in the woman's emotional release and Marguerite's renunciation of prying open the mailbox.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening and forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like the locket and mailbox; subtext operates in silence and image, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final display reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, observant perceptual signature fitting the curator's POV; third-person limited is stable, and diction remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense with high information density; metaphors like "stillness like the eye of a sandstorm" are purposeful, and rhythm varies naturally without artifacts. No loops or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a locked mailbox mystery resolved through patience and listening; the risk of not opening the mailbox heightens stakes, and specific details like thrift-store curation ground the premise. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
