<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in the inherited curse; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., breath catching at the notebook); final change from crying wolf to silent proof is earned with visible cost in the grief-repose balance, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal plot with tight because/therefore linkage; closure lands decisively with Marcus holding the notebook, shifting approach; cost legible in "hovering between grief and something almost like repose"; orientation clear early, lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constraining (lighthouse prison, copperlight); the notebook as micro-setting object charges the final image; sensory details like brine and copper smell are selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start with Monday deadline; escalation through descent and discovery driven by Marcus's agency; cost is felt in the retrieval of the notebook and emotional weight; one meaningful tightening under causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and silence emerges organically from actions and images; subtext in hush and copperlight; ending offers resonant non-literal answer with dead speaking for themselves, no moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; perception filtered through Marcus's focused pursuit; prose rhythm mirrors his determination; no head-hopping or distance issues, and perceptual signature is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; figurative language like "dust motes hover" supports atmosphere without muddle; no loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion maintains momentum through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms the fable with specific, grounded details; originality in the curse of speaking truths; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
