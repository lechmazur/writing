<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in ethical diligence; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "feeling its living weight settle against his palms"). The final choice to use the obsidian shim is earned by prior causality, and the cost of impermanent balance is felt. No significant weaknesses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with clear because/therefore linkages from problem to solution. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "not forever — never forever." Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of the fractured bob shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the obsidian ridge supplies the shim and mirrors temporal rhythms. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("razored fragments," "burning mirror"). The ridge charges the final image as it drowns under the tide, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) escalates through Elias's agency under the causal lens. The cost of incremental, temporary repair is unmistakable on the page. One meaningful tightening—from detection to correction—forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through the rake handle inscriptions and the obsidian repair. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("now was the only increment that mattered") without moralizing. Subtext is woven through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature mirroring Elias's precision. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., the reverie) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., "spine of volcanic glass"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of clockwork precision, geological time, and incremental absolution. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail (rake handle inscriptions, obsidian shim). The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
