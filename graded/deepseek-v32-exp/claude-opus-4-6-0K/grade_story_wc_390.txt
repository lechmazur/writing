<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (logic vs. emotion) are embodied in scene; her final choice to match the Stone's breaking is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (raw throat, frozen sweat). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because the Stone's frequency drops, Maren must match and raise it before sunset. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (physical exhaustion, emotional release). Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (drift-ice marina, frozen crypt) pressures choices via cracking ice and time limit. The key and Stone function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save marina) is signaled early; escalation via dropping frequency and dwindling sunlight tightens options. Maren's agency (vibrational matching) drives the climax; cost is legible in her physical strain and the frozen tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (endurance through resonance) emerges from action and image, but the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly as character belief, creating a minor thematic echo. However, the concept is otherwise integrated via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature blending technical precision and lyrical sensation. Voice modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., the old engineers' method) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sonic absolution") is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax, then breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering and mysticism in a unique setting (drift-ice marina). The concept of vibrational matching transforms a familiar rescue trope through specific, grounded mechanics and emotional cost. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
