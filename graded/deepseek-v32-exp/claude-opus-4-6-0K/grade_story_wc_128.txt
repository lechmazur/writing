<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is consistent and her motivation to uplift silent contributors intensifies from personal curiosity to systematic action. Interiority is concrete and emotions are embodied (e.g., "something tightened behind Maren's ribs"). The final stance (thinking of the next name) is earned by prior causality, though the motivation is occasionally labeled ("precise and unsentimental") rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with on-page cost ("joy tempered by the knowledge that recognition could so easily have never come"). The accumulative lens holds: events build through discovery and collaboration. Orientation is clear within 120 words; transitions between shards are legible and support the mosaic pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (salt air, breeze turning pages). The outdoor library and waterfront charge the final image and support theme, but the environment does not actively constrain choices. Specificity is high and filtered through Maren's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uplifting invisible labor) is signaled early and escalates through Maren's agency: research, collaboration, exhibit, plaques. A meaningful tightening occurs as the project expands from one name to many. Cost is legible in the closure's tempered joy and the ongoing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges through action and image, not just statement, though Dinah's articulation is slightly explicit. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Maren's smile and thought of the next name, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct: precise, observant, lyrical, reflecting Maren's professional attention and emotional undercurrents. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without overwriting. Example: opening paragraph efficiently sets character, setting, and mood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (lost photo, forgotten labor) through specific, grounded choices. The accumulative structure and quiet emotional truth feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the mosaic design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
