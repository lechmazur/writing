<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Final choice to bring a poem is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost in the final image. Orientation is early, and the ribbon's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse and ribbon constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. Meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the specter's fading and her decision. One meaningful tightening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through poems and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue serves subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, poetry, and spectral mentorship feels inevitable; risk-taking with the specter heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
