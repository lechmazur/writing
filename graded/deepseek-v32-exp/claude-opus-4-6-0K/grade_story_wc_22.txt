<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harmon's motivation is clear, rooted in grief and a belief in ancient pacts. Interiority is concrete and embodied in his ritualistic actions (speaking dead languages, handling seeds). His final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality—the incremental successes with the jetty's gifts. The 9+ test is met: contradictory impulses of loss and hope act in scene, and his choice to persist carries visible cost in his isolation and labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Harmon's ongoing work reconfigures the meaning of reclamation. Orientation is immediate and clear. The cost is legible on-page in the final paragraph's image of endless, patient labor against a dead reef and chewing sea. The persistent constraint of the dead reef shapes his tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The blooming jetty vs. the dead reef and battlefield creates a tangible ecosystem that Harmon navigates and harvests. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-stunted vines, black paste, light like bruised fruit). The jetty as a "narrow corridor of life" functions as a micro-setting that directly alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift driven by Harmon's agency. The dominant stake (healing the battlefield) tightens as he decodes bird calls and successfully transplants life. The cost is legible in his labor and the tangible, gradual softening of the land. A meaningful deepening occurs when the first shoots appear, reweighting the possibility of the pact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of submerged pacts and patient reclamation emerges organically from concrete particulars—dead languages, bird calls, seed pods. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carrying life "from one narrow place to another." No moralizing; complexity resides in the balance between relentless decay and stubborn, small-scale renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet grounded, mirroring Harmon's patient, observant nature. The voice modulates naturally with the accumulative structure. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("Narrow vastness—that was the feeling.") is taught and pays off at closure, enriching the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, dense, and rhythmic without artifact. Figurative language is precise and coherent ("light was the color of bruised fruit"). Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph achieves high information density and propulsion, cementing the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead languages, ecological listening, and post-collapse reclamation is highly original and feels inevitable. The quiet, accumulative risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived detail (the coachman's satchel, the labeled seed pods) into a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
