<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied (burns as "strange pink ridges"), and her adaptive trait earns the final Charged Poise. The shift from revenge to purpose is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, but her micro-choices under pressure remain consistent and reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her transformed stance. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of frost/ledger discovery tightens coherently toward the final image of broken light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon and frost are not just backdrop—they constrain choice (frost patterns decipher routes) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional eye, making setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs. revenge) escalates through her accumulative reading of frost and ledger, culminating in the cache discovery. Agency lies in attention and adaptation; cost is legible in her healed burns and the burden of the unburned ledger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through brokenness emerges organically from concrete images (glass, frost, fire) and avoids moralizing. The final line reweights prior material without stating a thesis, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, pattern-oriented perceptual signature that reflects Maren's artistry. No head-hopping; voice modulation under pressure is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffold or loop artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; sentence-level propulsion aligns with accumulative tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry, smuggler ledger, and frost-reading creates a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective payoff heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise is transformed through specific lived detail.</comment>
