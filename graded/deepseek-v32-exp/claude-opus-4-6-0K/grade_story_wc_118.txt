<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's odd sensitivity and unwavering purpose are concretely embodied through selective perception and micro-choices; her final endurance feels earned by established causality, though internal contradiction is minimal given the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost—the "displaced axis" reconfigures Maren's purpose; the accumulative lens holds cleanly across two shards, and the diary discovery deepens stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silo library and dreamless world are vividly filtered through Maren's perception; the setting actively enables her ability (acoustics) and the tapestry fragment charges the final image, constraining choice and resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving stories tightens meaningfully via the diary’s revelation; Maren’s agency in continuing despite the silent world carries visible cost, though escalation is more deepening than narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through specific images and the diary’s content; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive texture that matches Maren’s sensitivity; no head-hopping, and purposeful elision (the diary’s content) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: rhythmic, dense without padding, figurative language precise and unified; no loops or artifacts, and prose propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a historian collecting wall-stories in a post-dream world is fresh and synthesized with the displaced axis concept; risk-taking in quiet plot pays off with organic, inevitable feeling.</comment>
