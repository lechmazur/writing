<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's grim optimism is concretely embodied through micro-choices (rolling dice, writing equations) and contradictory impulses (scientist in an impossible system). Her final whispered "Not yet" is an earned endurance rooted in prior causality, with cost felt in the memory of Oran and the endless climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Charged Poise ("Not yet") that reconfigures meaning with visible cost (the infinite climb, the lost opportunity). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the two-shard structure (present climb/past memory) is legible and tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is a micro-setting that constrains every choice (cannot stop) and charges the final image. Sensory details (smooth gray stone, 18 cm high) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's analytical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: finding meaning in impossibility. Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs via density increase (dice analysis) that reweights the stake. Protagonist agency (choosing to climb, analyze) drives deepening, with cost legible in the final whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (imperfection as meaning in a perfect system) emerges through concrete particulars (the chipped die, the missed laugh). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Not yet") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV third‑person limited is stable; voice is distinct, mathematically precise yet grimly optimistic, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Maren's analytical mindset. No head‑hopping; purposeful elision (past memory) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("Escher fever dream") is purposeful; sentences vary in structure to match contemplative and climactic beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of perpetual motion, mathematical analysis, and emotional resonance feels inevitable. The infinite staircase and chipped dice are specific, irreplaceable elements that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Closure is fully committed to the premise.</comment>
