<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a lucid dream chronicler is concrete and drives the plot; her final choice to witness and heal with words is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Gregor's grief and the observatory's transformed feel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is anchored early; closure lands on-page with felt cost (Gregor pressing the telegram, observatory feeling close), and Seda's constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the observatory and daylily-pressed telegram constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "mechanical hum" and "crackling" daylily integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding/validation) escalates through Elara's agency via the telegram and correlation; cost is legible in Gregor's grief and the shared burden, tightening under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through particulars (dreams, stars, inscription) without moralizing; final image of Mira pulsing offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (lucid dream chronicler's precision); voice is lyrical yet controlled, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful ("slow suffusion of light"); syntax varies to support pressure, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars, and ancient inscriptions feels inevitable; risk-taking in blending scientific and mystical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with a +0.2 bonus for risk distinction.</comment>
