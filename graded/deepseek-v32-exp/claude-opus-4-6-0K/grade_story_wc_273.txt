<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion like "serene anger" and trembling hands; her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure are concrete, and the final transformation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost as anger becomes light; the accumulative lens holds, orientation is anchored early, and the ink constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly woven into action, with the wind-carved encampment and disappearing ink constraining choices and charging the final image through specific, sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sable's agency with the ink experiment, tightening under the accumulative lens; cost is felt in her emotional shift and the realization's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ephemeral patterns and the central question of time; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature tied to tracking and ink; POV is stable, and rhythmic prose heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes grief, time perception, and disappearing ink into a fresh, inevitable whole; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
