<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Delphine's motivation is clear and deeply rooted; her endurance under pressure is embodied in concrete micro-choices (playing "harder, not louder"). The final Earned Stasis—continuing her vigil—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (trembling, the "quiet weight"). Interiority is specific, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held tightly; closure is an Earned Stasis with legible cost ("carrying her inheritance..."). Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure escalates through density (thicker mist, twisted echoes) to a decisive reconfiguration of pressure. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not decorative: the grotto's prism atrium and mist constrain Delphine's actions and charge the final image ("stone silence"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her urgency, shaping choice and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) escalates through the grotto's intensified pressure; Delphine's agency drives the tightening (widening silences). Cost is unmistakable in her trembling and the weight carried. One meaningful deepening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images (silence vs. prophecy, burden). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the whispered "Not yet. Rest." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Delphine's perception. Diction and syntax modulate with pressure (e.g., "played harder, not louder"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet precise, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Information density high; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (prophecy, guardian) through specific, irreplaceable choices (saxophone as silence-tool, negative-space method). Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
