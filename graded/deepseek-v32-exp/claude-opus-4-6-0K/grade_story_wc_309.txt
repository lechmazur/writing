<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cael's interior contradiction (societal failure vs. personal meaning) acts in scene, embodied in clumsy fingers and the kept keystone. His final surrender—stepping off the ledge—is earned by prior causality (mentor's advice, spire's nature, automated world) with visible cost: embracing irrelevance for transcendence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where caring for a stone reconfigures value. Cost is legible in the final contrast between Loom engine's calculation and Cael's act. Orientation is immediate and vivid, and the spire's constraint shapes the entire tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and keystone as micro-setting constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail ("ice so old it had forgotten being water") is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Cael's perception, fully integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cael's agency under the accumulative lens: unstrapping the keystone and stepping into mist. The dominant stake (personal meaning vs. automated utility) tightens with a clear cost—rejecting the Consortium's value system to find sacred attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (keystone, mist, luminance). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—caring as sacred attention—without moralizing. Subtext operates in imagery (Loom cities vs. vine pattern), and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyrical, precise, poetically textured ("finger of frozen argument"). Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent; elision (e.g., mentor's decommissioning) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with every sentence advancing atmosphere or character. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally. No artifacts obscure clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and automation tropes transformed through specific choices (garden keystone, mist walking as surrender). The quiet, lyric climax is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
