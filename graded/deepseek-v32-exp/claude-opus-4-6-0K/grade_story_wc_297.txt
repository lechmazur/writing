<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with contradictory impulses (terror/wonder) acting simultaneously; final choice to enter the maze is earned by prior causality and visible cost in "anxious elation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost ("terrified... exhilarated"); orientation is clear within 120 words, and scars as persistent constraint shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt glade and topiary maze constraining choice and charging the final image through bioluminescent growth and spatial embrace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending the covenant) escalates via protagonist agency; cost is legible in the "vertigo" and commitment to mending, with one meaningful tightening from discovery to entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection between human and green worlds emerges through scars, glade, and covenant without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Sable's active mending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (botanical, network-oriented); voice is lyrical and consistent, reflecting Sable's mindset without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("voltage... vegetal") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of technological singularity and ancient botanical covenant feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
