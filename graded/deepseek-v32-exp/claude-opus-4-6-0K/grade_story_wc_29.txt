<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "brilliant but unproven" trait. Interiority is concrete (e.g., "cold knot in her stomach") and her final choice to broadcast is a micro-choice under pressure that reveals her values. The earned Charged Poise shows credible endurance with visible cost—"the fragile, gritty edge of hope."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: because she deciphers the hostile signal, therefore she intervenes via broadcast. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final lines. Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, when). The persistent constraint—the tricksters' patience—shapes her tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("burnt coffee and ozone"). The micro-setting (radio booth, charts) constrains choice and charges the final image—she uses the station to broadcast, and the charts "rustling in the ventilation draft" mirror her precarious hope. Spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing a catastrophic mistake) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Maren's agency: her discovery forces the high-stakes broadcast. Cost is legible on the page in her exhaustion and the "fragile, gritty edge of hope." One meaningful tightening (her decision to act) forecloses passive options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (vigilance vs. predictability, the danger of projection) emerges organically from the conflict. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "starlight filtered through smoke." Subtext operates in the recursive signal structure and the factions being "played." No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific precision tinged with dread ("something beautiful that could kill you"). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (the exact signal pattern) is taught and pays off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("like starlight filtered through smoke") is effective and not overused. Minor scaffold in "steady but raw" is slightly abstract but doesn't obscure causality or dull closure. Rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of first-contact tropes into a psychological power play. The core concept ("cosmic tricksters") is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. The quiet, strategic climax feels earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
