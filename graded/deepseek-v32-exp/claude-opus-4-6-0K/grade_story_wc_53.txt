<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's resolute scavenging and regret are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her internal contradiction (past ambition vs. present survival) drives the scene, and the final question to the ghost is earned by the accumulated fragments with visible cost in the rearrangement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the ghost's speech rearranges the fragments with felt cost; the intentional time disorientation is taught early and pays off at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and cloud-salt environment pressure every choice, constraining movement and supplying the fragments; the setting's "fractured stillness" charges the final image and mirrors Maren's internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with her ghost) tightens through the camera wheel's regret trigger; Maren's agency drives the escalation to the decisive question, and the cost is legible in the ghost's rearranging of her collected fragments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions emerges through specific fragments and the ghost encounter; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the ghost's silent response and the almost-readable order.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's chronologically confused perception; voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no scaffolding or loops; figurative language is controlled and purposeful, accelerating the emotional beats; closure image is clear and resonant, with high information density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal setting and intimate self-negotiation; the concept of collecting overheard stories that are one's own feels inevitable in hindsight, and the non-linear time structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
