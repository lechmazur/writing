<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's synesthesia and motivation are concrete and drive the plot; her micro-choices (following the map, pressing her palm) reveal values under pressure. The final weeping is an earned emotional release. A slight lack of contradictory impulses in the peak scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she returns home "carrying silence and sound in equal measure." The cost of her journey and the relief of proof ("wept... from the relief of proof") are legible on the page, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is a vivid, pressure-inducing environment that constrains choice (the climb, the map alignment). The sculpted hush is a micro-setting that decisively charges the final image and the story's climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (proving wonder is essential) are signaled early and escalate cleanly through her journey to the climax. The unfettering is a decisive, agency-driven action that narrows options and delivers a visible cost/relief. The aldermen's implied awe is a consequential payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image, resisting direct statement. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question ("wonder was not ornamental but structural") through the concrete image of her return and the resonating hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature shaped by Elara's synesthesia. No head-hopping. The prose modulation during the climax ("The cavern rang like a bell") is purposeful and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "oscillating repose" slightly tempers the score, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, glacial exploration, and a thematic argument about wonder feels fresh and specific. The core concepts (sculpted hush, prism-song bells) are organically integrated and transformed through character, earning the resolution.</comment>
