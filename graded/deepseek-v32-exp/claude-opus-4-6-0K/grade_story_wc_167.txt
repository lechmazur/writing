<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific ("her knees aching with the pleasant specificity of middle age"), and the final stance of finding sacredness in the mundane is consistent with established traits. However, the character operates primarily in reflection; there is no on-page contradiction or pressured micro-choice that tests her hierarchy of values. The closure is a reconfigured perception, not a choice earned by escalating causality, which limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final image of windows as "a small covenant" reweights the mundane with sacred meaning, with cost legible in the contrast between her knowing and others' ignorance. Orientation is immediate and precise. The persistent constraint of her professional eye shapes the final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV ("water still held that uncertain silver"). The prism atrium and the pond are not just described; they constrain the act of perception and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, evolving with the dawn. Micro-setting (the stones, the tools) functions as an extension of character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening cadence shift—from observation to realization. The dominant stake (finding/value in the mundane) is signaled early and tightens through her communion with the pond rings. Agency is in her attentive stance; the cost is the felt gap between her insight and the world's indifference, made legible in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges seamlessly from concrete particulars without statement. The central question of value in the mundane is answered through the final, resonant image of the window as covenant. Subtext operates in silence and implication (fishermen passing without notice). The epiphany is earned through the specific, layered ritual of stone-throwing and professional reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("noctilucent reckonings"). Voice is consistent, lyrical but grounded in the character's worldview. Some phrases verge on poetic abstraction ("the idea of white before anyone had named it"), but the voice remains character-motivated and the elision (of dialogue, of other characters) is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("the membrane between what had been and what would be had stretched to translucence"), creating a slight drag. No loops or scaffold. The final paragraph achieves clean propulsion and a resonant final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific, non-obvious synthesis of a harbor glazier's labor with a philosophical meditation on perception and value. The core premise is transformed through lived, tactile detail. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
