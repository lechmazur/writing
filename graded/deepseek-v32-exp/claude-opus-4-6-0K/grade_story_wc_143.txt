<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "eyes burning not from the light but from everything the light replaced"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost. No significant weaknesses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost on-page ("her eyes burning..."). Orientation is early and clear; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with time pressure tightening meaningfully. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory; the grain of sand and nightwatch hut function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Environment constrains choice (summit climb) and mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving last natural darkness) escalates under Accumulative lens via time pressure; protagonist agency drives the exposure and canister placement, with cost felt in the climax. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and memory emerges through particulars (grain of sand, canisters) without moralizing; final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity. Subtext is woven into action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, reflecting Elara's reflective nature. No dialogue, but elision and compression are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene pressure, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of future tech and personal mourning; details are specific and irreversible. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
