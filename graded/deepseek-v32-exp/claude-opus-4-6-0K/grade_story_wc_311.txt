<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's heartbreak is embodied and architectural, with micro-choices like pressing the atlas page driving her realization. Her renunciation of guilt is earned by prior causality, and the final understanding of Theodan's naming acts as a credible endurance with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Maren understands Theodan's revision, reweighting meaning with felt cost in the transient crystallized phrases. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Persistent constraint of her role shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Maren's perception, with the observatory's open dome and atlas page constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated into action. The sea monsters' ink-black eyes and cracked meridian line serve as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase through Maren's interaction with the atlas and crystallization, tightening the stake of giving shape to sacrifice. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost unmistakable in the phrases' dissolution at dawn. Dominant stake signaled early and reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: naming fears, sacrifice, and memory are realized through Theodan's revised drawing and Maren's crystallization. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the Echovore's closed mouth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Maren's perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "heartbroken... architectural") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image recharges motifs with clarity. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (reaper, sea monsters) into a fresh, specific vision through character-driven choices and lived detail. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
