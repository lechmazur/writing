<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's acoustic perception and struggle with silence are concretely embodied; her final acceptance of the unfinished is earned by the accumulative weight of loss and her micro-choices (playing fragments, keeping the bowl). No contradictions, and the cost of her endurance is visible in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in the apple's drop and her smile. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the persistent constraint of the chronic hush shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are indispensable, charging the final image and constraining Maren's world. Sensory details (salt-clouded glass, slack tidal breath) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (finding meaning in silence) escalate through Maren's agency—her choice to play unfinished music and unbind herself. The tightening is a single meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her acceptance of incompleteness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (mendicant's bowl, unfinished score, apple drop) without moralizing. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and anchored in Maren's acoustic perception; sentence rhythm varies purposefully with emotional intensity. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, and the rhythm supports the accumulative mood without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological loss, hyper-perception, and artistic struggle feels organic and inevitable. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and yields a fresh, memorable perspective without gimmickry.</comment>
