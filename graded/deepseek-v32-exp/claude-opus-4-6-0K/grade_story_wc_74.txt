<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's insomnia and painterly obsession are concretely embodied; her methodical hope drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final renunciation of sleepless struggle is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closing lines. Interiority is specific and avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lena feels sleep approach, with cost legible in the relief after four sleepless nights. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure deepens toward the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are filtered through Lena's perception, constraining her method (moonlight through glass) and charging the final image with saffron quiet. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes (proving kindness persists) escalate through density of reflection and painting; agency in using the brush tightens options, leading to a legible cost in Lena's exhaustion and hard-won peace. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—lost languages mirror lost kindnesses—without moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the portrait and the approach of sleep. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (daydream mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, rhythmic variety, and zero loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("saffron quiet," "trail of moonlight") is precise and coherent, advancing atmosphere and character without muddying peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insomnia, painting, lost languages, and kindness feels organic and inevitable; specificity in detail (moon-tipped brush, Sursilvan) avoids template plots. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
