<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and embodied (heartbeat counting, porcelain shard). Her motivation is clear, rooted in bureaucratic erasure, and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to transmit the proof-of-life package is earned by her labor and emotional conflict regarding her mother. The resolution is a credible endurance with visible cost—her solitude and the weight of her mother's failure—scaled perfectly to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: she climbs because she is bureaucratically dead, therefore she powers the observatory and reconstructs the data, leading to the discovery of the proof-of-life protocols. Closure is a decisive change (she obtains the means to reclaim her identity) with resonant reconfiguration in the final heartbeat-counting image. Cost is legible on the page in the "small defiance" and the "ghost" reclaiming a daughter, with the persistent constraint of the corrupted data shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is essential and pressure-exerting: the abandoned, snowbound observatory forces self-reliance and isolation. The porcelain shard (micro-setting) is discovered via the ink patterns and charges the final image when pressed to her chest. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (smell of dust and old ink, snow ticking). The dome's opalescence and the branching ink patterns mirror the dendrite-like data reconstruction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving she is alive to the digital record) is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: her successful data reconstruction narrows options and yields the cryptographic key. Escalation is driven by her labor and the discovery of her mother's logs. The cost is legible in the emotional weight of her mother's failure and the solitary, late-night triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection—both digital and personal—emerges organically from the concrete struggle with corrupted data and the bureaucratic void. Subtext operates through the porcelain shard (transformation through suffering) and the heartbeat as defiance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: failure yields hidden wisdom, and a digital ghost helps reclaim a daughter from the dead, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing through patterns, counting, technical focus). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity ("her breath crystallizing in the dark"). No head-hopping. The prose as character reflects Maren's analytical yet yearning mind, especially in the closure where rhythm mirrors her steady pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., the description of the ink as "frozen mid-spread like the dendrites of a nervous system"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence beautifully underscores the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic erasure, a digital ghost, and a remote observatory is fresh and specific. Tropes (SETI, AI) are transformed through grounded, character-driven stakes. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on identity and legacy. Risk-taking in the quiet, technical climax heightens meaning without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
