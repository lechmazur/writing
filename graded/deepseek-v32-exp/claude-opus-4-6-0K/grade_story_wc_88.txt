<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s emotional numbness and the flicker of rekindled empathy are concretely embodied; her choice to listen is earned by the labyrinth’s premise as treatment. Interior contradiction (jaded wonder vs. nascent feeling) acts in scene. No diagnostic label-speak; the final micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is anchored by ~120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—the flicker of feeling and decision to listen reconfigures stakes with legible cost. The time-travel set-up pays off in the labyrinth’s purpose, and the persistent constraint of the procedure shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is vividly selective and purpose-driven, filtering through Mara’s jaded wonder. It constrains choice (tunnel selection, wading) and charges the final image with attentive organisms. Micro-setting (baseball, newspapers) integrates into action and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling empathy) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Mara’s agency in choosing a tunnel and meeting Farrah. A meaningful tightening occurs as the flicker of feeling emerges, foreclosing emotional numbness with a visible cost—the potential return of painful guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as treatment, facing irreversible acts) emerges through concrete particulars—the procedure, baseball, labyrinth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the flicker and listening, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and filters perception through Mara’s jaded wonder. Distinct perceptual signature (“magnificent and meaningless”) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head‑hopping; elision (newspaper decoding) is taught and paid off in the labyrinth’s logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with vivid, specific imagery and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density is high (e.g., “delicately robust” carries character and physicality). Sentence‑level rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, organic synthesis of time‑travel, emotion‑stripping procedure, and labyrinth as treatment. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk‑taking (jaded wonder tone, bioluminescent setting) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific, avoiding generic templates.</comment>
