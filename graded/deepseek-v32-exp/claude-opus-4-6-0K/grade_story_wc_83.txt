<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Naima's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma and scientific pursuit, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the ongoing weight of memory. Contradictory impulses (grief/hope) act in scene, though the emotional terrain occasionally leans on abstract labels like "bleak exhilaration."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the realization that "stillness was not absence" reweights the hunt with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate, and the countdown-driven structure tightens coherently. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystal function as essential micro-settings, constraining choice (time pressure, tool use) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through POV, and integrated with action. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding potential pools) escalates under the Accumulative lens via the countdown and data progression. Protagonist agency drives each beat; cost is legible in the memory of the wedding and the "bleak exhilaration" of discovery. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (stillness as non-absence, unused potential) emerges organically from concrete events, images, and the geode motif. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication and reweighted symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, blending poetic and scientific diction that reflects Naima's expertise and trauma. Voice modulation under pressure is controlled; purposeful elision (e.g., memory shards) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly economical, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even at peak beats. Information density is high, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike trauma, astrophysical hunt, and philosophical concept feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded details (perturbation theory, geode) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric-scientific voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
