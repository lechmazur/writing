<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's reckless idealism and maternal desperation are concretely embodied; her final choice to trade her wild hope for her daughter's restoration is earned with visible cost on the page, and her interior contradiction (reckless vs. gentle) drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("a heaviness where lightness had been") and the ritual's constraints shape the entire second half, making the ending inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, constraining the ritual and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Maren's perception, turning setting into active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring Lise) is clear; escalation is driven by Maren's active performance of the ritual, culminating in a legible trade-off where her recklessness is exchanged for her daughter's desire.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice and the economy of desire emerge organically from the ritual and final image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, anchored in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, precise third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports the mythic tone, and there is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dense, poetic lines without overwriting; every sentence advances character or atmosphere; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard and bartered destinies; the emotional truth of maternal sacrifice feels specific and inevitable, with risk-taking in voice and concept that heightens stakes.</comment>
