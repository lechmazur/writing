<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("almost corrected the name"), with embodied emotion ("crack open in her chest"). Her final choice to reveal her true name is earned by the prior correspondence and Lumen's chalk symbol, foreclosing her path of secrecy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Decisive Change (writing her true name and walking forward) with on-page cost ("crack open in her chest"). The persistent constraint of secrecy versus authenticity shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective ("cathedral of forgotten tomorrows") and charges the final image (arcade's golden light). The sidewalk chalk functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice by prompting Maren's decision, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticity vs. safety) is signaled early and tightens when Lumen draws the chalk symbol, forcing Maren's choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in her chest sensation and act of writing her true name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust built through slowness emerges from particulars (surface mail, code in margins). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—choosing to be "real"—without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of walking into the light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical perceptual signature ("cathedral of forgotten tomorrows"). Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and any elision (the code's mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Information density is high, and the final line ("neither of them disappeared") lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes pseudonym creation, surface mail, and chalk-code cryptography into an organic, non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
