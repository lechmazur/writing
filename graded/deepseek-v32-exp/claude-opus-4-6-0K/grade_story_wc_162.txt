<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied through wood-grain reading and logbook analysis; her featherly determination and final realization are earned by prior causality with visible cost of silent distance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the final weather code revelation with felt cost of unspoken love. Orientation clear early; pattern of codes builds decisively to the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and oak table charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering through Maren's POV. The table as micro-setting enables her intuition method, directly shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density of weather-code pattern; Maren's agency in analysis forecloses rage for tracing, with cost legible in the CAVOK entry's silent observation. One meaningful tightening suffices under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges from particulars (mazes, logbook, thresholds) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the father's coded message. Subtext is rich and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "featherly determined") and no head-hopping. Elision (weather codes) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like something untethered") is consistent and clarity unobscured. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze architect, pilot logbook, and drifting terrace feels inevitable in hindsight; risk in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
