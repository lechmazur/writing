<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (proprioception, trauma responses). Contradictory impulses: she hates the enhancement but uses it to measure progress. Final endurance—continuing to walk while noting a two-degree improvement—is earned by prior repetition, with visible cost in the small, precise change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the two-degree unlocking and continued walk into the violet light reconfigure the stakes with felt cost—the incremental, arduous nature of recovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly specific and acts as a macro-setting that mirrors internal damage and penance. The body as micro-setting (proprioceptive enhancement) constrains choice and charges the final image through precise measurement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: Sera's struggle to find "the mathematics of mercy." Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via repeated exposure (strap touch, brace, release). Escalation is driven by her agency, with cost legible in the incremental shoulder unlock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of proprioception, trauma, and the forest's ultraviolet penance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—progress is asymptotic, measured in degrees—without moralizing. Subtext is rich in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinctive, blending clinical precision with poetic reflection. Voice is consistently filtered through Sera's enhanced perception and scientific mindset. Rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and flawlessly controlled. High information density without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of proprioceptive enhancement, trauma recovery, and ultraviolet forest as penance. The concept of "mathematics of mercy" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
