<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's curator perspective and bewildered interiority drive credible micro-choices; final tending is earned with visible cost in trembling, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchored early; closure is a charged poise with felt cost in trembling and realization; accumulative lens holds with nonlinear inheritance shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; the orchard and cameo blank constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating fully with character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding tightens via Maren's agency in inquiry and breakthrough; cost legible on-page in her trembling and reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and love emerges from concrete images; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, curator-filtered prose with stable POV; perceptual signature distinct; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs; high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astral orchard and nonlinear inheritance premise fresh and synthesized; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
