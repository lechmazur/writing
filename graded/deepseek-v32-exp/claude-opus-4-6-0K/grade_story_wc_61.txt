<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vesper's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion; her motivation to share light without fire compels her final choice to seed darkness, earned by lineage and unease, though the cost is subtle and more conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with charged poise—seeding darkness with petal-light reweights theme; cost legible in "troubling serenity"; gear and lineage persist as constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nebula garden and micro-settings like the gear constrain choices and charge the ending; sensory detail is selective, filtered through Vesper's perception, with high specificity and purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing light without fire deepens through Vesper's unease; under accumulative lens, her agency in altering transit escalates pressure via density increase, with cost in serene trouble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images of light, fire, and infinity; subtext in gear and petals; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic voice consistent and heightens accumulative texture; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language controlled and purposeful, supporting closure without muddying peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardening with sentimentalist character; risk-taking in lyric accumulative design pays off with coherence and emotional truth; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
