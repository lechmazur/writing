<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is rich with embodied emotion; Maren's combative tenderness and Fen's furious fear drive micro-choices that earn the closure via prior causality and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure via Fen writing forward is a charged poise with cost legible in the tea-leaf gap and the empty swing, shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library and mirrors constrain choice; the afternoon shadow and tea leaves charge the final image with specificity that avoids ornament, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through dialogue and symbolic action; Fen's agency in choosing to write escalates the conflict under the textural lens with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and return emerges through particulars like walking backwards and tea geometry; ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile, mentorship, and divination; specific details like shard-mirrors and tea leaves transform tropes into inevitable resonance, heightening stakes.</comment>
