<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Collective characterization works for accumulative lens, with trust motivation clear and micro-choices like moving seedlings revealing values. However, individual interiority is thin, and characters like Pascal and Tuva remain archetypal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, but cost is more summarized than deeply embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration in the harvest and "WELL DONE," charged by cost legible in "scratches were real." Orientation is clear early, and mosaic structure taught by pattern of messages coheres without causality breaks. Persistent constraint of Maren's death shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lavender sky, floating arches) filtered through colony's perspective; micro-setting objects like the copper bell constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment actively pressures decisions (cracking arches) and integrates seamlessly with action, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival escalates through accumulation of trusted messages and collective effort, tightening from warnings to blueprints. Agency is collective following Maren's guidance, with visible cost in grief and labor. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes, though protagonist agency is diffused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of brambled hope emerges organically from events and images like the copper bell and harvest; subtext in chalk messages avoids moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through "WELL DONE" and the spiral of pollinators, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Omniscient/collective POV is stable and apt, with lyrical, distinct voice ("a tightness like fruit not yet ripe"). Perceptual signature is selective and rhythmic control supports accumulative pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language purposeful and no loops or scaffolds obscuring closure. Sentences advance story efficiently (e.g., "roots threading stone like stitches"), and information density is high without overwriting. Read-aloud ear test passes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and colony survival, with specific, irreplaceable elements like chalk messages and floating arches. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "brambled hope" avoids generic templates.</comment>
