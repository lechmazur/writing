<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's loneliness and empirical intuition are concretely embodied, driving her choices; the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she touches but does not cross the doorway, revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from promise to discovery holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in her whisper and departure, and the rising creek constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the antique shop to the blooming cavern; the environment pressures choice via the rising creek and charges the final image with bioluminescent contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undoing loneliness vs. accepting her path) escalates through Elara's agency in finding the doorway; cost is unmistakable in her on-page renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promise and acceptance emerges through images and action; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice reflecting Elara's perception; no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax, high information density, and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of antique cartography and magical realism feels inevitable; risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
