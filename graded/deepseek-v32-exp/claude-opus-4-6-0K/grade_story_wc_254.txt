<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's aesthetic drive is concrete and compels her boundary-crossing; interiority embodied in resonant sensations (e.g., "felt the resonance travel up through her wrist"). Final choice to paraphrase earned by prior causality, with cost visible in her weeping. Contradictory impulse of obedience versus desire shown through backstory, though in-scene tension is more release than struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost (weeping from relief). Orientation clear within 120 words; ban lifting sets motive, atrium visit leads to paraphrasing. Persistent constraint of boundaries shapes tactics; cost legible in final image: "world was no less whole for having been spoken."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (frozen lake, cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade) is vivid, sensory, and constrains choice—Maren must enter to paraphrase. Environment charges final image: lake "held its breath." Micro-setting (colonnnade) actively pressures her action and reweights closure. No ornamental detail; all integrated through POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paraphrasing silence) signaled early; escalation via density increase under Accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives climax: she "opened her mouth and paraphrased the silence." Cost unmistakable: weeping from relief of dissolved boundary. One meaningful tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (boundaries between spoken/unspoken, art as paraphrase) emerges through particulars (ice remembering water, pillars humming). No moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer: world "no less whole for having been spoken." Subtext rich in imagery; epiphany earned through embodied experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature focused on beauty and resonance. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm reflect Maren's aesthetic sensibility. Elision (e.g., ban details) taught and paid off; psychic distance shifts intentional (closing eyes, feeling resonance).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language consistent and purposeful (e.g., "hummed the way grief hums"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene; no overwriting or register drift. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's role in silenced society; specific details (cloud-shadow poet, quartz colonnade) transform familiar tropes. Emotional truth in relief of expression; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes. Feels organic and inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
