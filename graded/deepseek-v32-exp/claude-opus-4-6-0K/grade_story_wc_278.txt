<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deep and motivated; her background as a constellation tattooist informs her mapping of lost sounds, and her final action to resolve inherited guilt is earned with visible cost as dissonance drains from her bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens; closure lands with meteor hush as a resonant reconfiguration, cost legible in the amber's change and Maren's release, and the haunted firmware drives causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Laboratory setting is vivid and constrains choices; the Loom and amber charge the final image, with sensory detail selective and purposeful, fulfilling the micro-setting test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes around hushing dissonance escalate through discovery of crying and letters; Maren's agency in using the amber creates a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, with cost in the resolution's silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, inheritance, and witness emerges through images like amber and constellations; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with Maren's POV filtering perception; prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping, and perceptual signature is distinct throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; no loops or scaffold, figurative language is controlled and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of haunted technology, personal guilt, and cosmic imagery feels inevitable; risk-taking in supernatural concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
