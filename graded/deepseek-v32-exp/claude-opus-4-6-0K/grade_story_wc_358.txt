<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her skepticism of official narratives, driving her methodical investigation. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her hair whipping in the wind, revealing her focus. Her final choice to present findings is earned by prior causality, with cost in her loneliness, though this is slightly told rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain with early orientation. Closure is a Charged Poise where Mara's realization of convergence reconfigures meaning with cost felt through Derry's shrine. The causal lens holds, and the wind constraint shapes tactics, making the closure indispensable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like "salt and diesel" and "hazy precision," filtered through Mara's professional gaze. The container labyrinth actively constrains choice by funneling wind and charges the final image with the shrine and fog, essential to the investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Mara's agency as she collects data and finds the shrine. Cost is legible in the amplification zones and her commitment to prevention, with one meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of convergence and foresight emerges organically from wind patterns and the shrine, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's plan to turn death into a preventable pattern, though it leans slightly explicit in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending professional precision with reflective depth. Prose rhythm and diction, like "The facts were hard. The meaning was vapor," control elision without head-hopping, reinforcing Mara's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language like "like a diver waits for still water" is purposeful. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of an investigator using wind patterns is fresh, synthesized with specific details like the twist-lock and shrine. Risk-taking in the quiet, foresight-driven closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
