<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nadia's solemn archivist identity is concretely embodied through stained fingers and grief; her motivation to uncover truth intensifies under retrocognitive pressure, compelling high-stakes choices like descending to the lagoon and parleying with Thomas. Micro-choices under stress reveal a hierarchy of values, and her final act of filing the evidence is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her "solemn and burning" stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from diary discovery to vision-driven quest to negotiated retrieval. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Nadia sees Ruth smiling and the zeppelin turns north, with cost legible in "solemn and burning." Orientation is immediate; no elision breaks. The persistent constraint of retrocognitive trap shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting—zeppelin library, Saharan dunes, obsidian lagoon—is vivid and selective, filtered through Nadia's archival perspective. The diary as object constrains choice via psychometric anchoring; the lagoon charges the final image. Sensory detail (foxed ink, salt crust, black water) is woven into action, and spatial choreography at the lagoon is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering erased truth) escalates through Nadia's agency: decrypting diary, enduring visions, journeying to lagoon, negotiating with Thomas. Each step narrows options under causal pressure, with cost felt in her shaking grief and the solemn resolution. The parley forces a trade-off that directly leads to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and restoration emerges through particulars—encrypted diary, debris messages, recovered microfilm—without moralizing. Subtext operates in Thomas's silent arrangements and Ruth's final smile. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "crushed obsidian" and Nadia's burning reverence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Nadia) is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature—notices "foxed ink," "salt crust," "static hum." Voice is literary yet grounded, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Thomas's debris-language is a purposeful extension. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a thought refusing to land") is controlled and purpose-driven. Sentence propulsion varies with scene needs, from lyrical opening to tense negotiation. No artifacts touch closure; readability is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of zeppelin archive, retrocognitive diary, and beach-debris parley feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded details (Mauritanian coordinates, microfilm tin). Risk-taking with magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the final image recharges prior material with emotional truth.</comment>
