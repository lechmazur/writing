<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's cool-headedness is consistently shown through micro-choices under pressure; her motivation is clear and the final integration of the echo is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; accumulative lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the echo settles into Maren, the constellations reset—with felt cost in the second heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is a vivid, constraining environment that charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and fully integrated with action and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (catching the echo) escalates via sleepwalking constellations; Maren's agency drives the climax, and cost is legible in the echo's integration, though not heavily weighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of giving body to emotion emerges through imagery and action; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant resolution without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice and stable POV; perceptual signature filters the strange setting through Maren's expertise, with rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold, figurative language is clear and purposeful, and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original premise and synthesis; risk-taking in style and concept pays off with clarity and emotional resonance, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
