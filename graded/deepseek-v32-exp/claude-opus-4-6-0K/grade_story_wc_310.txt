<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cael's quietly enthusiastic persistence and stellar doubt are embodied in concrete actions like humming and coin-arranging; her final choice is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in her isolation and doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the universe answers and coins melt into stars—under a clear causal lens; orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in "stellar doubt gnawed at her."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and foreign coins constrain Cael's choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cael's agency—listening, arranging coins, humming, singing—under a causal lens; stakes tighten with visible cost in her doubt and the transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events: the universe contracts to listen, and resonance enables new expansion; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet precise, reflecting Cael's focus on static and vibration, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or overwriting; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise—backwards prophecy in a contracted universe—is fresh and fully integrated; risk-taking in poetic conceptual storytelling heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
