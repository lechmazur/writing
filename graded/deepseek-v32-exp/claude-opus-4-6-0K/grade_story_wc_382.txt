<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies; her internal conflict and embodiment under pressure are strong. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the seal's weight and the building's breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; mosaic shards cohere and propel to a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a character: the building's language and the rooftop garden charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's architectural gaze, constraining choice and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (learning the building's language) escalate through accumulated lessons to a ceremonial interrogation; agency drives the deepening, and cost is felt in the responsibility passed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths versus facade emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion and figurative language are precise and serve the closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead languages and architectural magic is fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet climax and lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
