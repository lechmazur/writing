<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is deeply rooted in personal history, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost of continued resistance is legible. Causal lens holds tightly, and the persistent constraint of the raft city shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
