<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait (gift/ burden), interiority concrete through sensory perception. However, lacks on-page contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice is earned but internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (prophecy dissolved, wing blank) with visible cost (wing restored, silence holds). Orientation clear early; persistent constraint (paper wing) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (brook, nocturnal haven) pressures choice and supplies resource for mapping silence; recurring object (crane wing) constrains action and charges final image. Sensory detail selective, purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmake prophecy) signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens (prophecy resists, she presses wing). Cost legible on page (wing blank, silence holds). One meaningful tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. speech, meaning vs. chaos) emerges through events and images (wing, hush, brook). Ending offers resonant non-literal answer: silence holds if someone listens harder. No moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting character's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (mapping silence) taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense with high information density, figurative language consistent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats; closure image clear. Rhythm varies naturally, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: summoner of meaning unmakes prophecy through silence. Concept fresh, details particular; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
