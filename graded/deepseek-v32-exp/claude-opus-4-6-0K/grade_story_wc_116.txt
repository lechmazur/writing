<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character is vividly rendered through selective micro-choices (unfolding swan, marking crease, holding still) and a consistent, embodied stance of witness. Interiority is concrete and voice-driven. However, the lack of contradictory impulses acting within the scene limits the psychological complexity required for the highest band; her endurance is earned but static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the vine touches the swan and she exhales into the regenerative silence, with cost legible in the "almost nothing" breath that settles into the library's memory. Orientation is immediate; the single meaningful tightening (vine's approach) deepens the stake of witnessing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the keeper's perceptual signature (shattered tile, pale vines, soft mulch, arterial pulse of the river). The overgrown library functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures her stance of observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and pattern break (the new vine with breathing flowers). The dominant stake (to witness without judgment) is reweighted by the vine's interaction with the swan, a pressure point that tests her endurance. Agency is in her attentive stillness; cost is felt in her exhalation and the library's "crumbling peace."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (regenerative silence, change without judgment) emerges entirely through resonant particulars—composting books, shifting paper, the vine’s encroachment. The ending offers a non-literal, conceptual repricing: the keeper’s burrowing into stillness answers the central question through image, not statement, with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct lyrical and observational signature. Voice is perfectly calibrated to the character’s mindset—syntax and rhythm reflect her patient, loose grip on reality. No dialogue; all propulsion comes through filtered perception and controlled psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("arterial pulse," "paper had gone soft as cloth") is precise and consistent. Sentence-level propulsion mirrors the story’s accumulative quiet, accelerating and breathing with the beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of chronicle keeper, regenerative silence, and origami swan is fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with risk-taking in the accumulative, nearly plotless structure that heightens stakes through texture and image. The perspective feels singular and memorably authentic.</comment>
