<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal contradiction (practicality vs. fantasy) acts in scene. The final choice—finding the signal by discarding assumptions—is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("tears on her face"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: the city is reconfigured from "abandoned" to "paused," with cost legible in Maren's tears and the final image of the gorge "tuning." The pattern of signal-seeking tightens to a single decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the tower climb) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's professional POV ("oxidized copper and old rain"). The gorge and towers function as both environment and micro-setting, directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the signal) escalates under the accumulative lens via density increase in the tuning process. The turning point—"she began by discarding assumptions"—is driven by protagonist agency and leads to a clear cost (emotional release). Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges organically from concrete events and images (the star fragment, the shard of hush, the completed waveform). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature ("a chandelier no one had remembered to take down"). Poetic, compressed syntax is consistent and voice-motivated, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control and high information density. Metaphors are vivid and coherent ("static...thinned, like a crowd parting"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the tuning sequence and breathes at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi conceit and literary lyricism feels inevitable. The core concept ("a shard of hush") and the setting are transformed through specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking in poetic language heightens stakes and coherence, with closure remaining perfectly legible.</comment>
