<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is compelling with embodied motivation and earned final choice, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, capping at 8.8 under the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing and felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear, structure tight, and persistent constraint of dimming stars shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and objects (fort, booklet) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency as the last star remains; cost is palpable in the darkness, and pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from silence and mapping; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical with stable POV; perceptual signature focuses on silence, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, artifact-free, and rhythmically precise; figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is original and ingeniously executed; synthesis of mapping silence for an endless night feels inevitable and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
