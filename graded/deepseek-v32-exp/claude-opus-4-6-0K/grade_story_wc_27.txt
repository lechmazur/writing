<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (barefoot connection, trembling confidence) revealing her values. Motivation to reignite the rebellion is clear and rooted in her stargazer identity, culminating in a decision earned by prior causality. The final choice to bring others is a credible endurance, though the visible cost is more implied than on-page, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory details and reflection build to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with felt pressure; the promise she believes she can keep reconfigures her stance. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is undeniable but not explicitly paid, keeping it just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the stone circle and open roof are integral to the plan. The repair bay functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, Q2 is <9.0, so this category is capped at 8.8 per the global 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reigniting the rebellion) is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s interaction with the stone circle. Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by her agency, culminating in a decision that forecloses inaction. Cost is legible in the pressure of the stalled rebellion but not unmistakably on-page, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: stillness vs. action, resonance vs. fire. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of the hum carrying her breath. No moralizing; subtext operates through image and implication. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and rhythmic control is strong. No head-hopping. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (stargazer, stone circle, resonance) feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
