<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias's embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (dropping shears, clutching bead) root motivation; the ghost bride's devotion is clear through action. Final acceptance earned by accumulated memories, with cost in bead's shattering. Minor telling in "wept often" but does not undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: repeated cameos build to resonant reconfiguration (ghost solidifies, bead shatters). Closure on-page with felt cost—bead dust settles, fruits ripen—and orientation anchored early. No causality breaks; pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: greenhouse channels distilled moonlight, hosts unlockings; final image charged by ripening fruits. Sensory detail selective and purposeful ("silver apples," "fogged glass"). Environment shapes tactics and closure irreplaceably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt/remembrance) escalates through ghost's appearances, each deepening Elias's knowledge under accumulative lens. Agency visible in bead handling and final dialogue; cost legible in bead's destruction and emotional weight. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of debt versus promise emerges through concrete images (bead, fruits) and action, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "only a promise." Subtext in mournful elation tone; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with lyrical rhythm ("cathedral of recollection"). Perceptual signature filters through Elias's age and wonder. Elision taught (ephemeral appearances) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied syntax, and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; peak beats clear ("bead shattered into dust"). Read-aloud ear test passes with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reincarnation, alchemy, and ghost lore feels inevitable; specific details (stone bead, mercury pears) anchor freshness. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
