<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meera's motivation is clear and conflicted, with interiority embodied in sensations like "pressure behind her sternum"; her final choice to leave the journal is earned by the ritual's cost, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (purification and decision to share knowledge) with felt cost in tears and "second heartbeat"; orientation anchored early, and the accumulative lens holds steady.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the pagoda and archive constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details like "light broke across her face in bands of amber, violet" serve atmosphere and POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Meera's agency in stepping into the light; under the accumulative lens, density of memories deepens the conflict, with cost legible in her emotional release and changed stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer: "Some knowledge is forbidden because it must be earned"; no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent POV filter; perceptual signature is clear in phrases like "the feeling of a lullaby half-forgotten," and rhythm supports emotional pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language ("atoms of nostalgia") is integrated and clear, even in peak beats like the purification scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like "atoms of nostalgia" and the pagoda's defense mechanism feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
