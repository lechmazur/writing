<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's dry-witted composure and underlying worry are embodied through concrete interiority and micro-choices. Her final decision to draw is earned by prior causality—falcon's signal, phrasebook key, storm prediction—with visible cost in the approaching storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change as she begins mapping; cost is legible in "worrying tranquility" and the implied storm. Causal linkage from falcon to discovery to action is tight under a hybrid lens, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices: condensation pattern predicts storm, guiding her timeline; rusted outpost and frozen lake isolate and urgency. These elements constrain tactics and charge the final image of ink drying.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency—using evidence to act before the storm—under a hybrid lens. Stakes tighten with the 12-hour deadline, and cost is unmistakable in the tranquil yet worrying atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: truth versus cartographic lies, rivers' memory. Subtext in falcon's indifference and phrasebook entry; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via her drawing, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with cartographer's precision—perceptual signature in reading condensation, phrasebook details. POV is stable, single, and elision is taught; rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful ("gravity had a sense of humor"), and peak beats remain clear, with no muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography, indigenous knowledge, and singular convergence feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet tension and professional detail heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
