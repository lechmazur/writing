<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's blankness and performer's discipline are concretely embodied; her internal contradiction (numbness vs. the tremor of feeling) acts in scene, and her choice to "begin again" is an earned endurance with visible cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a charged poise ("the faintest tremor... she begins again") with legible cost in the reconfigured silence and the weight of endurance; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines and farmhouse are not just backdrop—their shadows, hum, and paved fields constrain Maren's world and charge the final image with inescapable pressure; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional survival vs. mandated joy) tighten through accumulative density; the shift from narration to the unnamed tremor is a deepening driven by her agency, with cost felt in the "remade hush."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (performance, authenticity, grief) emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the wooden sparrow and the decision to begin again, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is a distinct, performer-inflected third-person limited; rhythmic control and perceptual signature (noticing like a stage artist) are consistent and heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is flawless—high information density, zero loops or scaffold, figurative language purposeful and coherent; sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with the accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise gains freshness through specific synthesis: whittling, narration, and turbines transform a familiar dystopian concept; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off with closure intact.</comment>
