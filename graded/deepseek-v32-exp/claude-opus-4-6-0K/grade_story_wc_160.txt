<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction is concrete and embodied; her final choice to carry both truths is earned by the decoded letter with visible cost—she cannot absolve her father, yet understands his encrypted compassion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("She could not absolve him"); causal lens holds tightly from discovery to realization; orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breathing thermal vents charge the final image—vapor wraps her like an embrace—and sensory detail is selective, filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness vs. truth) escalates via her agency in decoding; cost is legible in the irrevocable harm of eleven deaths, forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges through particulars (floodgates as apology, chain as key); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature—professional lyricism ("encrypted compassion"); rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid figurative language ("ghost of an audience") that never muddles; no loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floodgate mechanics, volcanic setting, and surveyor's chain decoding feels inevitable; emotional complexity avoids template plots.</comment>
