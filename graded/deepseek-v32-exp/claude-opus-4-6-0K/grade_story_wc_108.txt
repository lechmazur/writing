<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with fear as a physical memory. The final choice—to stand publicly as Lena—is earned by the decryption beat and the reconceptualization of her phobias, with visible cost in her trembling certainty. The "firmly adaptive" trait drives her mid-scene action of decrypting the cast, showing micro-choices under pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her realization about fear ("the body remembering...") which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (renaming herself, choosing to go public) landing on the page with cost ("shaking... certain"). Drive lens is Causal: discovery of betrayal → search for evidence → decryption → new tactical decision. Orientation is immediate; the rusted library setting anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph. The plaster cast functions as a persistent constraint that shapes the tactics of her outwitting plan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered and actively pressures the scene (working by starlight, the groaning structure). The micro-settings of the cast and seashell are not just described; they constrain choice (decrypting the notes) and decisively charge the final image (shell fitted into cast hollow). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her urgency (ink bled over years, stars burning through the roof).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving her stolen identity to dismantle Gerard's empire) is signaled early and tightens through the decryption beat, which provides the means to outwit. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to decode the cast, then synthesizes the evidence into a plan. Cost is legible in her trembling and the foreclosed path of anonymity/stunt work. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power, fear as memory) emerges seamlessly from concrete particulars: her phobias, the cast, the seashell's whisper. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via her decision to "let the world see her flinch." Subtext is rich in objects and embodied fear. No moralizing; the final realization is earned through the decryption work and physical synthesis of shell and cast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third, with a distinct perceptual signature ("stars burned through the collapsed roof like punctuation marks"). Voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in her urgent, tactile focus. Syntax and rhythm modulate beautifully with emotional intensity, compressing in decisive moments ("She was shaking. She was certain."). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without muddle. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("She held the seashell half against the cast... and felt a trembling certainty move through her"). Rhythm is masterful, varying with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative confusion. One very minor strain in "the acoustic memory of a lullaby pressed into calcium carbonate" is a hairline slip but does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of stunt double phobias with a stolen identity plot is fresh and specific. The trope of discovering one's past is transformed through the grounding in the stunt profession and the evidence of the child's cast. The core concept feels organic, not checklist-driven. The final image of the shell fitting the cast hollow is a unique, inevitable inflection.</comment>
