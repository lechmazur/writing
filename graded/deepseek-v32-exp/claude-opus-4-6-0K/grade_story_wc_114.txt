<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sable's interior contradiction (awareness vs. avoidance of the truth) is embodied in concrete perception; her final choice to descend and speak is earned by the oracle's answer and her own calibration, with visible cost in the final image of cold clarity. The post-fever clarity and the smudge on the illustration are specific, character-particular details that drive her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (the sorrow of dawn, the acknowledgment that survival ≠ restoration). Orientation is immediate and clear; the oracle's answer provides a metaphorical turn that deepens the stakes and leads to Sable's decisive internal change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the mountain weather station pressures choices (isolation, measurement) and charges the final image (cold clarity). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone, copper light, wind instruments) and entirely filtered through Sable's professional and emotional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (calibrating the weight of a swallowed truth) escalates through the oracle's answer—a thermal inversion metaphor that deepens Sable's understanding and forces her stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's acknowledgment of sorrow and the decision to speak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (oracle, illustration, meteorological data) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: truth as stagnant air, speech as fault‑tolerant, clarity and cold as one. Subtext operates through image and implication throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third‑person POV is stable and distinct, blending scientific precision with lyrical introspection. Voice has a consistent perceptual signature (noticing through measurement and metaphor). No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent and character‑specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and flawlessly controlled; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and integrated (e.g., "the sorrow of all dawns"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a fault‑tolerant oracle, meteorological metaphor, and intimate psychological stakes feels inevitable and fresh. The thermal‑inversion answer is a non‑obvious, deeply integrated turn that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
