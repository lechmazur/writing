<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's compassionate reclusiveness is embodied in contradictory impulses (crumpling/smoothing the invitation), and her final letting go is earned by prior causality with visible cost in released guilt. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal plot with clear because/therefore linkage: invitation → return → reading → healing. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (Maren releases guilt, Codex restored) with felt cost in Dag's exhale and her open hands. Orientation is anchored early, lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (laundromat-hidden library) and constrains choice; the "enlarged tranquility" of candles charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Codex/internal conflict) escalates through Maren's agency under causal lens; her reading is a tightening choice with cost legible in her release of guilt. Resolution earned by protagonist's alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of nestled paradoxes is woven through events and imagery, not stated; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("holding everything by letting go") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent (e.g., invitation as "small, insistent heartbeat"). Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere (e.g., "flame itself had learned to breathe more slowly").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of nestled paradoxes is fresh and fully integrated; emotional specificity (Maren's empathy as blade) makes synthesis inevitable. Risk-taking in philosophical theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
