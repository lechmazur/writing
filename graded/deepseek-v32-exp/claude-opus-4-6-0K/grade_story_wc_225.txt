<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maret's interior contradiction (guilt vs. productive fidgeting) is embodied in scene; her final forgiveness is earned by the causal work of unfreezing the village, with cost legible in the waking village and her "fierce repose." The chess-tutor backstory tilts present micro-choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change (village waking) paired with a Resonant Reconfiguration (self-forgiveness), felt cost on page in the rain falling and child's laugh. Hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds; time-freeze constraint shapes tactics throughout. Orientation is clear by ¶2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen village is vividly specific and pressures every choice; the tapestry and labyrinth function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory selection ("woven hush," suspended raindrops) reflects POV's analytical focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free village/self) escalates under causal lens via her agency: each thread-pull tightens options, with visible cost in the trembling raindrops and final awakening. One meaningful tightening suffices; closure forecloses her frozen guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (stillness vs. movement, guilt/forgiveness) emerges through concrete images; ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via the waking village and her internal release. Slight thematic echo in final line ("forgave... let it go") is earned but prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (chess tutor's analytical eye) and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression (backstory interleaved) is anchored and pays off at closure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled; figurative language ("amber of stopped time," "woven hush") is consistent and heightens atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence‑level rhythm supports the gradual unfreezing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time‑freeze, tapestry decoding, and chess‑tutor psychology feels organic and inevitable. Risk‑taking in quiet internal climax alongside external magic pays off; specificity (platinum labyrinth, frayed threads) avoids template plots.</comment>
