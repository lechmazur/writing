<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation to "braid diverse voices into harmony" is concrete and embodied in her method of subtracting noise; the choir members' sketched backgrounds add texture without cliché, and the final acceptance of transience is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the silence and leaf fall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing via the leaf image, reweighting vanishing arts with felt cost in the acceptance of impermanence, and the rosette constraint shapes the final resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospherically essential, but the environment does not directly constrain choices; the rosette object charges the theme but not the final image decisively, missing the 9+ gate for choice constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around vanishing arts escalate through Marguerite's speech and the singing act, deepening under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the unhurried leaf fall, though agency is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and harmony emerges naturally through images and subtext (e.g., brothers' eye contact); the final leaf image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical and controlled with stable POV; perceptual signature reflects Marguerite's sensitivity; rhythmic prose heightens accumulative pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high density, varied rhythm, no artifacts; figurative language is precise and consistent, supporting closure without muddle; read-aloud ear test passes perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high in synthesizing vanishing arts, choir therapy, and personal release; specific details like the zither rosette and diverse choir feel inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in quiet lyricism.</comment>
