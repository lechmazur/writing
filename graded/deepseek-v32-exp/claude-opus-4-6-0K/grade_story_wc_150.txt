<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adaeze's interiority is embodied and specific, with motives rooted in diaspora longing; her final kneel is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are more implied than enacted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a charged poise with cost legible in "The ground was warm. It had been waiting." Orientation is anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard and sundial are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring faith) escalate via Adaeze's agency in rebuilding the sundial; cost is felt in the final image's reconfiguration of her connection to the earth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges through particulars, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the warm ground and waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Adaeze's lyrical, searching consciousness without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops; figurative language ("roots had learned to love the dead") is consistent and purposeful, clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora return, ancestral magic, and quiet climax; specific details (catacomb orchard, sundial) transform tropes into inevitable, risk-heightened stakes.</comment>
