<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction between duty and creative impulse is embodied in concrete micro-choices (staying to sketch, pocketing the sextant). Her final act of saving the file as "Gate 11" is earned by prior causality—the discovery of the sextant and her reading of the terminal's flows—with visible cost in the recognition that "proposals died in committee." No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through professional perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive density to a Charged Poise closure: Maren leaves carrying the sextant, its weight measuring "angles between what was fixed and what was possible." Cost is legible in the final image's quiet potential against bureaucratic inertia. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the pattern of discovery and reconfiguration is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is rendered with vivid, POV-filtered specificity (confetti in grout, dormant infrastructure). It constrains choice—its "maze of intentions" and existing flows become the assets for Maren's redesign—and charges the final image through the recurring sextant piece, which transforms from artifact to symbolic tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase: Maren's survey shifts to discovery, then to creative reimagining. Agency drives the tightening—she chooses to sketch a resurrection plan. The cost is unmistakable: the weight of potential against likely institutional failure, crystallized in the final pocketed sextant and saved file.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "hope as engineering" is enacted through redirected flows and the sextant's function. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—resurrection through tracing existing currents—without moralizing. The terminal as "reef absorbs shipwrecks" and the final image reconfigure prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's engineering mind filters observation into geometric and systemic patterns. Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise, modulating with reflective intensity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., professors' note) is anchored and paid off in her functional creativity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a reef absorbs shipwrecks") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence variety supports accumulation; no artifacts obscure closure. The final line lands with crafted cadence, recharging the sextant motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned spaceport, civil engineering, and navigational artifact feels inevitable. The angle on "hope as engineering" is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective pace heightens stakes without gimmickry; the sextant's reprise transforms the closure.</comment>
