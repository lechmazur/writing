<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (amoral philanthropy vs. secret sentimentality) act in scene; final endurance (staying until rain) earned with visible cost in dissolved footprints and fractured reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with charged poise (rain, echo) and conceptual cost; orientation clear within first paragraph; map constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt flat setting constrains choice (acoustic bowl) and charges final image with transformative rain; sensory detail selective, purposeful, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (release of songs); cost legible in the mirroring rain and her disappearance; tightening via approaching thunder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation/destruction emerges through particulars (egg, recordings, drought); ending offers resonant non-literal answer via echo and rain, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (clinical yet poetic); prose rhythm controlled, voice consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished prose with high density, no loops or artifacts; figurative language precise and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally with scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropy and secret sentimentality; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
