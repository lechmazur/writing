<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maret's archivist obsession is concrete and drives micro-choices; her final decision to begin work is earned by prior causality and exile's cost. Interiority is embodied (e.g., "reactively visionary"), and her relationship with Osen applies subtle pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise (her writing the first new entry) that reconfigures the ruin into a starting point with felt cost of exile and decay. The accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the trumpet valve provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Maret's expertise (salt corrosion, "blank page" harbor). The archive's decay and the trumpet valve constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reinforcing theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring meaning to the archive) escalates via the valve's discovery and the archive's ruin. Under the accumulative lens, density increases reweight the stake; Maret's agency in beginning work forecloses despair, with cost legible in the water-stained walls and seven-year absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of navigating absence emerges through concrete particulars (indices, valve, gaps) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of writing on a "blank page," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (archivist's eye for corrosion and fragments). Voice modulates with lyrical precision under pressure; minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("harbor gleamed wet and pale as bone") is precise and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist tropes through specific, grounded details (kelp-wrapped crates, reactively visionary mind). The concept feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template echoes.</comment>
