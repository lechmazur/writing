<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Senna's meticulousness and grief are concretely embodied through her translation process and tactile interactions with the seed and arbor. Her final choice to plant the seed is earned by the causal chain of her brother's death and her need to understand transition. The cost is felt in the burning eyes and the pulse against her chest, showing a credible endurance that forecloses simple answers for ongoing work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and reflective layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with clear cost: planting the seed and whispering Tariq's name reconfigures her grief into continuity. Orientation is immediate and functional; the single-scene structure tightens cleanly under the lens with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is not just vivid backdrop; it actively constrains choice—Senna kneels on its branches, feels its hum, and plants the seed in its bark where field lines converge, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone smell, cuneiform texture, indigo sky), all filtered through her scholarly, grieving POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening via translation: each step of deciphering the seed's cuneiform narrows her understanding until the realization about resonance reweights the stake. The cost is legible when she thinks of Tariq's hand on the tablet, her eyes burning. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, foreclosing passive grief for active recommitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars: unfinished work, transition as resonance, grief reconfigured into continuity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—planting the seed as reestablishment rather than closure. No moralizing; subtext operates in gestures (pressing seed to chest) and the final image of the arbor carrying Tariq's name downward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature—scholarly, tender, methodical. Voice modulates under pressure but maintains lexical consistency. The lyrical, accumulative prose is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, with all reflection anchored in present stimuli.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in early sentences ("great spiraling arcs," "luminous form") but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Information density is high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm works, though a few stacked modifiers slightly soften propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of linguistic scholarship with spiritual fantasy, grounded in specific emotional truth (grief, unfinished work). The magnetic arbor as waypoint and transition as resonance are inventive transformations. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
