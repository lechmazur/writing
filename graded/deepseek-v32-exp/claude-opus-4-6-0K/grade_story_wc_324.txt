<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (protect the vulnerable via persistent curiosity) is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to break protocol. Her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("Her hands were shaking"), though interior contradiction in the moment is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; the discovery of the child’s pulse triggers a decisive, protocol-breaking intervention. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost, and orientation is anchored early and clearly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the hearing aid are not just atmospheric but constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine tracing to an urgent, high-risk intervention driven by Maren's agency. The cost (emotional toll, protocol violation) is legible on the page and tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of incidental heroism and protection emerge through specific events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of Maren listening again.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive with no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is precise and serves the atmosphere; sentence-level rhythm supports the tension and closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept ("contact tracers for hearts") is a fresh, specific synthesis; the old hearing aid as tool transforms the familiar. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
