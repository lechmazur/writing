<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique trait as a tree-song sculptor, driving her to carve music from silence. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., tracing bark like braille, weeping without sound). The final choice to strum the instrument is earned by her prior analysis and crafting, foreclosing her isolation with a felt cost of emotional release. Minor deduction for a slightly tidy emotional progression, but the characterization remains strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sensory detail and silent work builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the pulse connects the grove. Orientation is clear within 120 words (Maren in the alder grove, world gone quiet). Closure lands on-page with visible cost in Maren's weeping and the shiver of leaves, reconfiguring silence as part of the music.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the siskin alder's spiral grain dictates carving, the sculpture's cracks provide the interval map. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pale trunks, crazed glaze). The grove and porcelain insulator charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating connection in a silent world) escalates through Maren's agency: discovering the sculpture, analyzing cracks, building the instrument. The strumming is a meaningful tightening that forces a trade-off—her emotional release for a shared pulse. Cost is legible in her weeping and the grove's shiver, though the external consequence remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as a rest in music, empathy as motion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the pulse is not sound but shared feeling—reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and gesture (the hedgehog's uncurling as permission).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptual signature (e.g., "searching for the sentence hidden inside the wood"). Voice is lyrical, controlled, and distinct, with rhythmic prose that mirrors the symphonic theme. No head-hopping; elision (the Quiet's cause) is purposeful and paid off in the conceptual repricing of silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise ("timber held melody the way amber held light"). Sentence rhythm varies, accelerating to the strumming and slowing at the weep. No artifacts obscure closure; the final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: a silent world and a sculptor who reads music in wood. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded details (porcelain insulator, stress-crack analysis). The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of a quiet, vibrational climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
