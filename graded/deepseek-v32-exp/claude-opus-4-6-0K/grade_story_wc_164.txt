<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent; her micro-choice to examine the seeds reveals her disciplined curiosity. However, interior contradiction and emotional layering are minimal, and the final endurance, while earned, lacks a visible cost beyond the established “heartbreak.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: missing pieces prompt conjecture, bird brings seeds, she completes the records. Closure is a decisive change (understanding memory migrates) with felt cost in her solitary, ongoing labor. Orientation is immediate and pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The geode and crater glass are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren’s professional gaze, and the environment directly enables her discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving complete memories) is signaled early and tightens when the bird arrives; Maren’s agency drives the escalation. Cost is legible in the race against dissolution, but the pressure remains moderate, and no live option is foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s migration emerges organically from concrete events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final smile in “luminous gloom” reweights prior material with quiet complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; voice is lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature (professional, poetic). No dialogue, but compression and patterned diction are taught and legible, supporting the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (e.g., “a language of longing. A grammar of joy.”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-work, crystal geology, and migratory ecology feels organic and inevitable. The sea-foam recollectionist premise is fresh, and the turn via seeds is non-obvious yet earned. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
