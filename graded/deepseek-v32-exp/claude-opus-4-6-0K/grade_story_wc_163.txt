<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation (belonging) is concrete and drives micro-choices; her internal contradiction (outsider longing) acts in scene, and the final charged poise—staying, sharing her work—is earned by the prior causality of isolation and Kosta's genuine engagement. The burnt feather as talisman embodies her values without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina's realization about belonging crystallizes on-page with felt cost in the shared, transformed image of the plankton bloom—"a luminous respite" that reweights her isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring isolation and enabling the luminous phenomenon that charges the final image. Sensory detail (pressure-treated glass, bioluminescent glow) is filtered through Marina's professional perception and seamlessly woven into action, constraining choice and deepening the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes (belonging) escalate through density increase—her solitary work juxtaposed with Kosta's arrival—culminating in a shared exhalation that reweights her options. Agency is her choice to show and translate her charts, deepening connection with visible cost/transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (belonging as a rhythm made, not learned) emerges entirely through concrete particulars—the feather, the charts, the plankton-as-fireflies—without statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior imagery, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice carries a lyrical, observant perceptual signature specific to Marina's expertise. Diction and syntax modulate with emotional intensity ("a luminous respite. That was all it was, and it was everything") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("shadowseam," plankton as "slow galaxies") is precise and integrated, heightening pressure without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise (landscape astrologer in a sunken city) is a fresh, specific synthesis; emotional truth arises from grounded character choices, not gimmickry. The integration of concept, setting, and imagery feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
