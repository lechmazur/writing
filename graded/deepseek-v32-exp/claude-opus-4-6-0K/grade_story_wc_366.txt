<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's reticence and observational nature are consistently shown through concrete actions and interiority; her decision to restore the light and engage with the cairns is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her ongoing commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image; orientation is clear early, and the cairn pattern teaches the drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lantern room and cairns constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's POV to build atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maren's agency under the Accumulative lens; stake deepens from practical safety to emotional connection, with cost legible in her sustained vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communication and protection emerges through cairns and light; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, via the image of stacked stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Maren's observant nature; no head-hopping, and elision (cairn language) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no artifacts; figurative language ("luminescent ache") coheres and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and communication ritual; cairns as anonymous letters transform tropes through specific detail, emotional truth, and inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
