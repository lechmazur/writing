<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her wistful pragmatism drives micro-choices like counting buds and placing mirrors, earning the final renunciation with visible cost in "It was not much. It was enough."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she scatters mirrors, with cost legible in the lost petal and the quiet effort. Orientation anchored early, and the quivering hush tightens into action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harbor, fire escape, and alley form a micro-setting that constrains choice—the bare rosebush necessitates mirrors—and charges the final image of scattered light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is to reflect light; escalation under accumulative lens via density increase (hush, stillness) leads to her agency in placing mirrors, with cost in the foreclosed hope for lasting blooms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of tending what remains emerges through particulars—rosebush, gauge tooth, mirrors—without moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice has distinct perceptual signature (gardener's precision, lyrical reflection) and rhythmic control, e.g., "push, settle, push, settle," with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density, figurative language consistent and purposeful, no loops or scaffold; syntax accelerates with pressure ("She worked with the rhythm of oars in water") and breathes in quiet moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire escape gardening with mirrors to reflect light; specifics like the lockmaster's tooth and broken compacts create inevitability, and risk-taking in quiet lyricism pays off.</comment>
