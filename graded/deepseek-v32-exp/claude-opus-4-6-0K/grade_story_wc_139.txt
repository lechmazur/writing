<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory; internal conflict between clinical distance and personal witness is embodied in her micro-choices, culminating in an earned decision to act, with visible cost in her commitment to complete Dariush's work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal-hybrid lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure lands with a decisive change as Elara resolves to publish the cartoons, cost legible in "the least the living owe is to finish the sentence he started."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funeral home setting is vivid and sensory; the ink pot as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with details like "glass belly dark as a bruise" filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fair trade escalates through Elara's discovery of the cartoons, leading to her active choice to publish; agency under causal lens drives tightening, with cost in her newfound purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fair trade as completion emerges organically from particulars like the doorway cartoon; subtext in images resists moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final calculation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., backstory) is anchored and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density; no loops or scaffolding; figurative language like "irony coats Elara's throat like embalming fluid" is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of con artist's child, funeral home, and political asylum feels fresh and inevitable; specific details like the ink pot and cartoons create authenticity without gimmickry.</comment>
