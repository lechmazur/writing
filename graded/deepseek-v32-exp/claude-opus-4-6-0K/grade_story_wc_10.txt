<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s survivor backstory and lost voice ground a clear, embodied motivation; her micro-choices (striking forks, adjusting intervals) build to a decisive final act earned by prior causality. The capsize trauma and physical silence are not ornamental—they shape her project and charge the closure. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV, one continuous scene with woven backstory; orientation is clear within 120 words. Causal/Hybrid lens holds: because of the Severance and her expertise, she sequences emotions into tones and therefore broadcasts a message. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (the imperfect smile carried, the stranger’s warmth). The ending image reconfigures prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is vividly specific and acoustically essential—it amplifies pure tones, constraining her methods and charging the final broadcast. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (frozen glass, sternum ache). The tuning forks and glass panels function as micro-setting that actively shape choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence into music) is signaled early and escalates through her rectification of errors to the decisive broadcast. Agency drives the tightening: she moves from private testing to public declaration. Cost is legible in the imperfect harmonic of her smile and the muted city’s reception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between discord and pure tone, survival and expression. The “unshaken marvels” concept is earned through the glass and music, not stated as moral. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the imperfect but carried message reweights the premise without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren’s acoustic researcher perception. Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing frequencies, vibrations). No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“like water through crystal”) is consistent and purposeful. Information density is high—each sentence advances character, setting, or stakes. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (only pure tones travel post-Severance) is fresh and fully committed; the synthesis of acoustic science, emotional mapping, and survival feels inevitable. Details are specific (winterglass, tuning forks) and transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, conceptual stakes heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
