<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nasreen's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, and cost is visible in the photograph's weight and her steady hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held throughout; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with cost legible in the photograph and her recovery. Orientation clear early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the arboretum and cliff charging the final image. Micro-setting (lemon tree, shears) constrains choice and enriches atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal conflict between trauma and resilience; escalation via freeze and pearl technique driven by agency, with cost on-page in somatic reactions and photograph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through particulars without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material with resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (pearl concept) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. No loops or figurative muddle; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery through gardening, with specific details like drone strike wedding and pearl of stillness. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes.</comment>
