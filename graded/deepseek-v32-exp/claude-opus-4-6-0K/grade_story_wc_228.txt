<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation is rooted in a long-held promise, with interiority shown through concrete actions and embodied emotion. Her shift from safe repetition to risky exploration is earned by the mirror's crack and cave epiphany, with visible cost in abandoning the quay. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final choice feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through detail to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost as Eloise understands her promise and changes her routine, foreclosing her old path. Orientation is clear early; the mirror's constraint shapes tactics, and cost is legible in her not returning to the quay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Eloise's perception, from the familiar quay to the mineral-streaked cave. The cave environment constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as the crucible for her epiphany. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic truth vs. safety) is signaled early and escalates through Eloise's agency in seeking the cave and painting anew. Under the accumulative lens, density increases to a pattern break, with cost felt in her abandonment of the quay. The tightening is driven by protagonist choice, and the price is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically from particulars like the cracked mirror and pool reflection, without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication; the epiphany is earned through concrete experience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Eloise's lyrical, perceptual signature consistent throughout. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction matches her artistic sensibility. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflection anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and sentence structure that advances story and character. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated. Information density is high, and clarity remains intact even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis of artistic stagnation, coastal setting, and metaphysical concept, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail and emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet, internal arc heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
