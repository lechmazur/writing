<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory (fear of touching the blank vs. desire to connect); her final choice to carve is earned by prior reflections and lessons, with visible cost in letting go. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change (she begins carving) under an Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the act of giving shape to grief. Orientation is clear early, and the wood blank as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (rain-beaded skylight, loft) and the ash wood blank as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal grief) escalates through Maren's agency and the kettle's timeframe; her decision to carve forecloses inaction with unmistakable cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the hand carving and "here and gone"; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is woven into image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "each droplet a tiny lens"); voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion tamer's widow, wood carving, and grief feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
