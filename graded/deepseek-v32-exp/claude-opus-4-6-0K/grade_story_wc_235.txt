<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her "feral nostalgia" and jealousy of past selves drive micro-choices (writing on birch bark, seeking specific dreams). The final renunciation—choosing to dream despite the grave's reality—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the grave's patience vs. dream vitality). Contradictory impulses (longing vs. acceptance) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Wren sleeps, with the final image reweighting the grave's finality against the dream world's ongoing vitality. Cost is legible in the last paragraph's contrast. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the pattern of reflection and dream recording is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (cabin, grave, birch bark) constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details (pine pitch, wind shushing) are selective and POV-filtered. The birch bark and grave recur with reweighted meaning, and the environment pressures Wren's isolation and recording.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal: reconciling mortality and memory) escalates through accumulative deepening of "feral nostalgia." Agency is in Wren's choice to record dreams and then seek a specific past self. Cost is unmistakable: the grave waits, but she chooses dream-world vitality, foreclosing a path of pure acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory, time, mortality) emerges through concrete particulars (scrolls, grave, dreams). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image's reconfiguration. Subtext operates in the contrast between granite permanence and dream impermanence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and consistent. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "peaks held the last grey light... like something they were embarrassed to return"). Lyrical rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (scrambled chronology) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with charged specificity. No artifacts that obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept (lucid dream chronicler discovers her own grave) is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Birch bark scrolls and "feral nostalgia" are unique, grounded specifics. Risk-taking (internal, lyrical) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
