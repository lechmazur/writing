<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s characterization is rich and specific: her revolutionary past concretely anchors her present defiance and poetic inclination. Interior contradictions (defunct yet persistent) are embodied in micro-choices like draping mirrors and choosing verse. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) feels earned by prior causality, though some backstory is summarized rather than fully dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly: pressure builds via the storm and the shard’s projections, leading to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis) where Maren finds proof in creation’s persistence. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (“defunct… but the shard held its light”). Orientation is clear early; the single-scene structure with interleaved backstory meets Track A defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable and deeply integrated: the baroque asteroid’s natural formations, time-light, and storm directly constrain and enable Maren’s observation (covering mirrors, shard projections). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her expertise. The environment charges the final image (“gilding everything… with the amber of what had been”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validation of her belief/legacy) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens via the storm’s intensification and the shard’s revealing projections. Agency resides in her attentive observation and interpretive choice; the cost is legible in her resigned, elegiac acceptance. One meaningful tightening (the storm’s peak) deepens knowledge and reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (creation persists beyond creators) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the shard, the projections, Maren’s isolation—without direct statement. Subtext is rich in the juxtaposition of her “defunct” state with the civilization’s forgotten beauty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material (“proof that creation persists, even when its creators do not”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that matches Maren’s poetically inclined mind. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., the storm’s buildup, the elegiac close). No head-hopping; purposeful compression (backstory interleaving) is taught and legible. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly controlled, with varied sentence structures that accelerate and breathe with the scene. Figurative language (“hair of some ancient god”) is consistent with voice and atmosphere. Minor risk of slight overwriting in one metaphor, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archaeological mystery, visible time, and elegiac character study feels fresh and inevitable. The baroque asteroid and crystal shard are specific, irreplaceable elements that transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the closure effect is fully earned and conceptually integrated.</comment>
