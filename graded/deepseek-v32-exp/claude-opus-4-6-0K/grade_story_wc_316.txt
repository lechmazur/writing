<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selu's emotional numbness is embodied through concrete actions (e.g., holding the brain jar without feeling); her final choice for joint custody is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "raw ache of wanting." No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (joint custody, Selu's awakening); causal lens holds tightly from ego death to fight resolution; orientation is immediate and functional, with history rewriting mirroring internal shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating dojo and shifting history actively pressure choices (combat testimony setting) and charge the final ocean image; environment constrains tactics in the fight, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody) escalates through petition, fight, and realization; Selu's agency drives the turn to joint custody with clear emotional cost on-page under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of complementary brokenness emerges from particulars (brain jar, fight method); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared custody and the ocean, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; dialogue advances plot with subtext (e.g., "You can't even cry"); perceptual signature is clear, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the air tasted like salt and change" closes with charge).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone custody, ego death, and shifting history; emotional specificity avoids tropes; risk-taking with complementary opposites heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
