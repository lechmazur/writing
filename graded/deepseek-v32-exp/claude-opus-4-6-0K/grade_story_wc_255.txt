<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's colorblind painter premise is fully realized through concrete micro-choices (trading garden work for space, affixing the reed) and contradictory impulses (painting without sight, soft cunning). Her final decision to embed the broken reed is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost in Aster's unlocking. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is embodied and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aster's breath awakens the reed and shifts her internally. Cost is legible in "something behind her ribs shifted, a small unlocking." Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure tightens through patterned details of barter and perception without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (glassblower's courtyard, phoenix heat, herb garden) constrains choice and charges the final image—reed tongue warps in phoenix-heat, garden arrangements dictate trust. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Maren's colorblind perception). Micro-setting (reed, plants) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic awakening through imperfect exchange) escalates via Maren's agency in affixing the reed, which tightens options and deepens the barter concept. Cost is felt in Aster's unlocking and the reed's "imperfect note." Under accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in imperfection, barter as mutual awakening) emerges through particulars (reed tongue, plant language, colorblind painting) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; final image reweights prior material resonantly. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Maren, with distinct perceptual signature (colorblind painter noticing values and geometry). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("trembling air that made the world look half-molten") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence propulsion supports accumulative pressure; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment>Original synthesis of colorblind painter, glassblower's courtyard, and bartered awakenings feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific lived detail (plant arrangements, reed tongue). Risk-taking in quiet, resonant closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
