<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in her life's work. Her internal conflict between deception and truth leads to a credible, earned choice to mend lies into a genuine claim, foreclosing other paths with visible cost in the waiting and risk. Micro-choices like polishing marbles and planning submission reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara places the polished marble and waits, with the maze rustling not from wind, reconfiguring stakes with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly—audit threat drives her plan—and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of measurable luck shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, filtered through Elara's POV, with sensory details like cracked marbles and yew walls. The maze and marbles constrain choices and charge the final image, essential to plot and theme. Economy is purposeful; no generic placeholder. The environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the maze) escalates under causal lens via Elara's agency: she chooses to mend deception, narrowing options. Cost is legible in her risky plan and the waiting for auditors. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—cracked marbles, grafts, blooming withering—offering a resonant, non-literal answer on love versus skill, deception transformed. Subtext operates in gesture and image; no moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice reflecting Elara's perception. Diction and syntax are controlled, rhythmic under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective and character-specific. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, advancing story without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; no overwriting or register drift. Closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of measurable luck and botanical deception, transformed through specific character and setting. Turns feel earned; emotional truth is specific. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Integration is seamless and inevitable.</comment>
