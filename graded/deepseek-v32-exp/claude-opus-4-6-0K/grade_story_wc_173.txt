<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and motivation clear, but internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized in simultaneous action. The final choice (release) is earned by prior causality and scaled to length, with visible cost in the transformed world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (the released echoes reconfigure the social order) with undeniable conceptual cost on the page ("the lullaby of conformity would find that no one was listening anymore"). Orientation is immediate, structure a single coherent scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and snowy courtyard are not just vivid but function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully filtered through Ilara's poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening density of effort and consequence as Ilara untangles the threads. The dominant stake (freeing silenced voices) tightens through her bodily commitment, with the cost legible in the world's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (refusal, untangling, release). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carried seeds and songs, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, with a distinct, consistently maintained perceptual signature—the "bodily poetic" idiom. Rhythmic control is exemplary under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., "between that sigh and that smile") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive with high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and pattern-driven. Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates with the beat of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of "Harvest of Echoes," chaste courtesan, and harmonic unlocking feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in sustained poetic register heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is followed to its full implications.</comment>
