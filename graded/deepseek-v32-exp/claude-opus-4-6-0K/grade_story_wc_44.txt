<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her deliberate nature; interiority is concrete and emotions embodied. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the highest band, though her final choice is earned with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where she becomes the place shadows return, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—floating observatory, brass instruments—and functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (seals, key) and charges the final image with noon-light and unfurling shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find shadows) escalates through Maren's agency in opening seals; cost is unmistakable in her transformation at closure, tightening options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge and transformation emerges organically from events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of seven shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct scholarly voice; perceptual signature is selective and consistent, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and rhythmic variation supports propulsion, especially in peak beats like the final seal opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh synthesis of reality-bending spoons, rune scholarship, and shadow physics; risk-taking in conceptual closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
