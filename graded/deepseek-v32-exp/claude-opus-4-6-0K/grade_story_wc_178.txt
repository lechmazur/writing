<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Samara’s frugality and observational rigor are concrete, driving her discovery and the final acceptance; her internal tension between empirical frugality and devotional commitment is embodied in micro-choices, and the covenant’s acceptance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Samara accepts the ancient covenant, with cost legible in her whispered coordinates and the indifferent stars; orientation is immediate, and the tile’s constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palace and tile function as micro-setting that pressures choice and charges the ending; sensory details (amber light, nightjar call) are filtered through Samara’s perception and integrate seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density—from curiosity to decoded devotion to covenant acceptance; Samara’s agency drives each beat, and the cost of her commitment is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of covenant with the unknown emerges through specific images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, scholarly voice that reflects Samara’s perception; rhythmic control and perceptual signature heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line-level propulsion supports the accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient mathematics, astronomy, and personal covenant feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
