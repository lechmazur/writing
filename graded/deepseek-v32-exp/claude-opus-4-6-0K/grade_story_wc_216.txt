<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in concrete interiority; final endurance is earned with visible cost, though internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in immediate scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) and legible cost in the final image, shaped by the persistent constraint of the Numerics Accord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; the emerald silo and urn fragment function as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Maren's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) escalates through protagonist agency; cost is unmistakable in her acceptance of unresolved mysteries under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is precise and enhances clarity, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time, memory, and loss; specific details like the Numerics Accord and broken urn feel inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes.</comment>
