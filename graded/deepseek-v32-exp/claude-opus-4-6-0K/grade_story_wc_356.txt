<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's ambition and sensory sensitivity are concretely embodied; her internal conflict (retreat vs. acceptance) plays out in scene, and the final serenity is earned by prior causality with visible cost during the bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing—Lira's realization reweights beauty and decay—with felt cost in her endured overwhelm; causal lens holds tightly from seed to bloom to wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Treetop village and corpse flower pot are vividly specific; the flower's stench charges the final image and constrains Lira's choice, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity within motion) escalates through Lira's agency—planting, journalizing, facing the bloom—with cost legible in her sensory struggle and refusal to separate opposites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lira's journey; the final image of death and orchids offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, deeply integrated with character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice has a distinct lyrical texture filtered through Lira's olfactory sensitivity; perceptual signature is consistent and heightens pressure at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with rhythmic variation and high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language ("hummingbirds stitched the air") serves atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of treetop healing, corpse flower, and sensory burden feels inevitable; specific details (doodled paper, tide's thought) transform familiar tropes with fresh, grounded vision.</comment>
