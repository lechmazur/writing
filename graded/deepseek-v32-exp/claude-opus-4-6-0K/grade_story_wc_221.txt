<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction as a "blessed pariah" is concretely embodied; her final choice to transmit the sketch is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the echoed silence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost ("the pause before a new sentence begins"); the accumulative/textural lens holds, and the temporal dilation constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observation deck as micro-setting constrains choice (Maren lingers due to residual dilation) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency in sketching, leading to the compass rose discovery; cost is legible in her foreclosing stasis to seek a new heading under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the sketching custom and temporal stretch; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("ready to look again") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, and any elision (e.g., the silence echo) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "the silence echoed once more."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation with personal direction; risk-taking in quiet reflection pays off with inevitability, and the core premise is transformed through specific lived detail.</comment>
