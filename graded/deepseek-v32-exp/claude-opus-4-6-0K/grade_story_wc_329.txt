<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority is embodied through actions like breathing hard and turning the locust shell. However, internal conflict is minimal, with consistent determination rather than contradictory impulses under pressure, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal structure tight; closure lands with cost as statues fall and orchard spreads, reconfiguring the city's relationship with beauty. Orientation is immediate, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints (statues) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the orchard's statues force Maren's tactical shift. Sensory details like "fruit glowing like trapped sunsets" charge the final image of wild beauty invading the mechanical city, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal perseverance to transformative action; Maren's agency in adapting her music drives the uprooting, with visible cost in toppled statues and the orchard's uncontrolled spread under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges through the locust shell and uprooting without moralizing; the final image of "tarnished and wild" beauty reprices the premise with conceptual cost against stasis, offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with a lyrical, perceptive voice that mirrors Maren's artistic sensitivity; diction and rhythm control enhance pressure, as in the "resonantly soft" hum and heartbeat synchronization, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "gears and exhaust" and "trapped sunsets" is purposeful, and sentence propulsion accelerates with the uprooting climax, showing high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban decay and enchanted naturalism; the locust shell as catalyst and heart-rhythm signaling feel inevitable, risking magical realism that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with specific detail.</comment>
