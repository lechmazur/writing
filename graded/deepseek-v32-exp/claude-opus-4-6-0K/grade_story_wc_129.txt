<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vael's contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. isolation) are embodied in her reed-sculpting, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis—"waiting to be woven in return"—is a credible endurance foreclosing her solitary path, with the cost of her transformed "luminescent ache" legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vael's ache changes, reconfiguring her stance within a community she built. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; cost is visible in the final image ("reed in hand, waiting"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of gathering (symbol, Korin, others) coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not just vivid; they constrain choice (she sculpts under the arbor, uses marsh reeds) and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Vael's POV, and the setting evolves from solitary to communal space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kinship) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Vael's agency (confessing her symbol, teaching others), creating a meaningful deepening that reweights her ache. The cost—the transformation of her loneliness—is unmistakable on the page at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges organically from concrete particulars (reed figures, the tag, the gathering). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "standing inside it... waiting to be woven," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in Vael's poetic, edge-dweller consciousness. Diction and syntax are consistently voice-motivated ("catching light and splitting it into spectrums that hurt the chest"). Rhythmic control is excellent, and any compression feels purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor risk of abstraction ("luminescent ache") is voice-consistent and anchored in embodied cost, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—a reed sculptor's graffiti tag summoning a chosen family—is a fresh, non-obvious angle on belonging. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes.</comment>
