<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("diligently curious in the way that makes fear forget its own name"), micro-choices under pressure (finding phrasebook, decoding hopscotch board) reveal hierarchy of values. Earned endurance/renunciation in final image; no contradictory impulses in scene limits to high-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in final image ("as stranded as she was, yet not quite alone"). Persistent constraint of isolation shapes tactics; orientation clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (airship, valley, hopscotch board) pressures choices and charges final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful ("silk envelope patched so many times it resembled a quilt"). Micro-setting (phrasebook, hopscotch board) constrains discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting discovery) signaled early; escalation via density increase (starlings, phrasebook, hopscotch board) under accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives each beat; cost legible in her solitary achievement and waiting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sociable isolation emerges through particulars (narration to empty ship, final parallel with stranded luminance). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; perceptual signature distinct (cartographer's professional noticing, lyrical precision). Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "She worked through the night") taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language precise and pattern-taught ("like ink dropped into moving water"); closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (apprentice, airship, mysterious phenomenon) feels inevitable; specific details (hopscotch board as map, stranded luminance) transform trope. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
