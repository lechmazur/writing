<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is precise and driven by her profession; her methodical curiosity and disciplined empathy are embodied in micro-choices like the "discipline of proximity without contact." The final renunciation—leaving the chapel whispering—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her restrained report.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lena finds "tenderness" in the tear between known and unknown. Orientation anchored early; cost legible in her decision to not sensationalize, respecting the Belgian's silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-bearing: the fresco vault's decay dictates Lena's conservation tactics, and its "whispered" acoustics charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through her professional POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (interpreting silence with empathy) escalate through accumulative density—comparing video footage deepens understanding—and Lena's agency in drafting the report forecloses sensationalism with a felt cost. One meaningful tightening suffices under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence and loss emerges organically through particulars (map tear, video comparison, Belgian's gesture). The ending offers a non-literal answer—"a kind of tenderness"—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice carries a perceptual signature shaped by Lena's conservator mindset, with rhythmic control and purposeful elision (e.g., "the rain had been patient"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("faces dissolving into mineral bloom") is precise and momentum-driving; sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of map framing, archival silence, and fresco decay feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Details are specific and irreplaceable to Lena's perspective.</comment>
