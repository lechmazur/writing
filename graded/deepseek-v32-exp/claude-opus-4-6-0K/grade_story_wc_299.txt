<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and contradictory, embodying his "confidently uncertain" state; final renunciation as "the thread in the weave" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closing image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation anchored early; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in "so the silence would know what it was holding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry setting constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "swallowed sound" mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates via protagonist agency—Rita's delivery triggers discovery—leading to a tightening choice with cost legible in his appraisal for the record.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "the cloth between the sound and the world," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable; perceptual signature distinct in sound/silence diction; rhythmic control under pressure with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is clear and propelled by precise syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser in a quarry setting; risk-taking in quiet, reflective arc heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
