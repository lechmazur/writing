<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her past; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., scar tissue "singing"). Contradictory impulses act in scene—carrying destruction and building simultaneously—and her final choice to plant the tree and hum is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: her father's death and her unyielding compassion. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early; persistent constraints (coin, tree) shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. Micro-setting (coin, tree) functions as integral environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving scars can sing) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Maren's agency (planting, mixing sands, humming) under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her father's death and her scar's resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; subtext operates in gesture and implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the tree and coin, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, reflecting Maren's consciousness. No head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is impeccably crafted with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Peak beats maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesizes elements organically; tropes are transformed through specific details (grafting, scars singing). Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
