<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren is vividly characterized with a unique ability and consistent motivation, but internal contradiction is minimal, preventing the highest band. Her final choice to mail the letters is earned by her established observant and empathetic nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is taut and causal, closure lands with conceptual cost under an accumulative lens. The persistent constraint of her ghost-seeing ability shapes the final image of released burdens, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and integral; the abandoned circus ticket office and the mainspring barrel function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maren's agency from a professional task to a humanitarian act, with legible cost in the ghost's release and her promise. The accumulative tightening reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden burdens emerges organically through concrete particulars like the cracked barrel and dust patterns; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical yet precise third-person POV that reflects Maren's professional observation. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with no artifacts or muddle. Sentence-level rhythm and information density sustain clarity and momentum through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator repair, ghost-seeing, and circus lore feels inevitable; specific details and a quiet, risk-taking ending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
