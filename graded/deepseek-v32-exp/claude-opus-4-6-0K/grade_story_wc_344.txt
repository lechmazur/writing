<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and embodied through trembling hands and fear of losing her gift; her micro-choices (uncapping oil, dropping it on gears) reveal hierarchy of values, and the final change—trembling stops—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost ("The trembling stopped") under an accumulative/textural lens; the prophecy and mirrors pattern teaches rhythm of repair, and persistent constraint (her trembling) shapes tactics, leading to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (frozen library, frost-refracted light) and constrains choice; the gear assortment and mirrors act as micro-settings that charge the final image by enabling Sable's learning of rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (losing her gift) escalates through Sable's agency—finding prophecy, using oil on gears—under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the cessation of trembling and the carried patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of break and mend emerges organically from gears, mirrors, and reflections; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("not perfection, but the steady, salt-worn patience") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (locksmith's attention to mechanisms, cold); voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("cathedral of ice," "breath came in small ghosts") is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of eclipse locksmith, frozen library, and hall of mirrors feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme, with emotional truth avoiding generic templates.</comment>
