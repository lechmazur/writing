<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation evolves from interpretation to authorship with embodied emotion and earned change; internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy; final confident uncertainty is rooted in causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot has tight causal linkages anchored early; closure is a charged poise—she begins editing—with cost legible in the pen's fading resonance; causal lens holds, and the pen's depletion shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Locus is vivid with purposeful sensory detail; the pen as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image; setting integrates with action and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal error to rewriting causality via Maren's agency; dominant stake of accurate meaning is tested through pen use; cost is clear in the pen's depletion and edit consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from interpretation vs. authorship conflict; subtext in the pen's power; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through ongoing work, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
