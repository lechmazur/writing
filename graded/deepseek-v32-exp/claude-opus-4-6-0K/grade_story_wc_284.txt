<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied through scars and micro-choices; her final decision to meet Dmitri is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her reflection on avoidance. The motivation—finding unused courage—drives key turns without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words; closure lands on-page with a decisive change (her commitment to go) and felt cost in the scars and covered mirror, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice via snow codes and thaw, charging the final image with mist and light; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's POV to pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under the causal lens: decoding the message narrows options and forces a choice with cost legible in her physical and emotional scars; dominant stake (personal redemption) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (thaw, pillbox, scars) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of spring and climbing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., cipher details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle even in peak beats; sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of burned spy and snow-code mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in quiet, internal closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored in specific detail.</comment>
