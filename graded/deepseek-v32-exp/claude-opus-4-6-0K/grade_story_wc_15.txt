<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is clear and rooted in concrete traits; her interiority is embodied and contradictions (risk vs. mission) are shown in scene. The final choice to hang the tapestry is earned by prior causality with visible cost (scar, years of work).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: the tapestry transforms the labyrinth from ruin to reverence. The accumulative lens holds, orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the scar and rising tide. The persistent constraint of time shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the labyrinth and tide constrain choices; the etching plate and tapestry charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (mapping the labyrinth) and escalate via the returning tide. Maren’s agency in sewing the tapestry drives the escalation, and cost is unmistakable in her hurried finish and the physical scar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions: transformation of ruin to reverence, the power of unconscious knowledge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tapestry and the lullaby of water.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with lyrical prose that reflects Maren’s poetic perception. POV is stable third-person limited, and the whisper carries subtext. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is precise and purposeful. Sentence variety supports momentum, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of sleepwalkers’ grooves revealing a map is original and fresh. The synthesis of weaving, mapping, and labyrinth mythology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes.</comment>
