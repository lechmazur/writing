<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is clear and drives her exploration; her internal shift from dismissal to profound understanding is embodied through specific micro-choices like placing the orris root. The final sanctification feels earned by her accumulated attention and personal cost of absence, though the change is more resonant than decisively active.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren's noticing completes a circuit with the house, cost legible in "the house exhaled." Orientation is immediate, structure builds through patterned details to a crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a vital pressure: the house's specific, sensory details (dust motes, bay window, hush-shard) constrain Maren's movement and charge the final image. The quiet bay and spring atmosphere are filtered through her perception, becoming inseparable from the thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why houses feel alive) tightens through Maren's agency as she explores and discovers the hush; escalation is a deepening under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in her offering and the house's recognition. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of displacement and accumulated silence; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer ("to make the silence holy") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in objects and the hushed tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates with emotional intensity; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing minute changes) and syntax supports the accumulative rhythm. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, and the final image lands with uncluttered precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (haunted house, seeker) through fresh concepts like "shard of hush" and sanctification by displaced objects; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the perspective feels singular and inevitable.</comment>
