<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren is vividly realized through her skilled, patient work and unique perception; her motivation to decode and repair is consistent and drives the story. However, the story lacks a moment of internal conflict or a difficult choice that tests her under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds to a resonant closure (Charged Poise) as the repaired music box plays and the ship departs; the lens holds and cost is felt in restored connection. High-band eligibility is capped due to Q4's pressure score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is essential to the protagonist's perception and the story's atmosphere; the setting constrains her method (via moisture for refraction) and charges the final image with transience and repair. Capped due to high-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (repairing the music box) is clear and thematically rich, but there is minimal escalation or pressure; the story relies on accumulative resonance rather than causal tightening or a meaningful on-page choice that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair as restoration of invisible threads emerges organically from the particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Capped due to high-band gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that captures Maren's unique way of seeing; no head-hopping. Capped due to high-band gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery; no loops or artifacts, and the closure image is clear. Capped due to high-band gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using a hummingbird drone to perceive via water refraction is fresh and organic; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Capped due to high-band gate.</comment>
