<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, but the characterization remains slightly static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the stillness after memory. Orientation is immediate and clear. The persistent constraint of "no fire" shapes tactics and the final image of light passing through her hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and selectively detailed, with the grotto and sea glass acting as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is woven through action and perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase and a pattern break (the new glass glowing). Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) tightens via memory resurfacing and protagonist agency, with cost legible in the father's death. However, external pressure remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and action: light found in broken things, connection across distance. Subtext operates through implication (memory forbidding fire). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close, with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature. Voice is consistent, diction apt, and rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (memory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. Peak beats are clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of an earthbound star watcher polishing sea glass to capture starlight is fresh and specific. Tropes are transformed through grounded detail. Emotional truth feels authentic, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
