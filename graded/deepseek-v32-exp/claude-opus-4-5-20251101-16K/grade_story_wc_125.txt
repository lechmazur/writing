<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and rooted in concrete traits (poet, escapee) with embodied interiority (touching the rope). Her final choice is earned by prior causality and the rope’s recurring pressure, showing contradictory impulses in scene. The cost of becoming “between” is legible and scaled to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (“between what was and what is”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered revelations. Orientation is anchored early; the rope’s constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (terra-cotta grotto, starlight), woven through action. The grotto and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering time’s texture) escalates through the beings’ offer and Mira’s agency. The choice narrows options with visible cost (leaving human time). Under the Accumulative lens, a single meaningful deepening reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (rope, layers, digging) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of holding moments “that can never be returned to,” reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poet’s lyrical notice). Voice modulates with pressure; elision (beings’ communication) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythm controls peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“time’s texture at last: rough as rope”) is consistent and clear. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-as-strata, energy beings, and poet’s quest feels inevitable. Risk in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation through specific detail and moral calculus.</comment>
