<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's guilt is embodied and her motive compels high-stakes choices. Interior contradiction (precise movements despite tremor) and a micro-choice (pocketing the empty bottle) reveal her hierarchy of values. The final choice to write the truth is earned by the confession's cost, foreclosing her path of deceit. Eleanor's metaphorical advice is a distinct, constraining trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: guilt → summoning → confession → new purpose. Closure is a decisive change (Vera's shift to restorative action) with clear cost felt in the empty perfume bottle and the resolved "ethereal grit." Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, when, goal). The persistent constraint of "imperfect miracles" shapes the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (copper wire, cut crystal, jasmine, settling dust). The archive and orchard pressure the choice via impending loss. The perfume bottle as a micro-setting constrains the ritual and its emptying charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption/amends) escalates through Vera's agency: summoning, risky confession, and acceptance of a costly task. The tightening is the ghost's conditional forgiveness which forces a trade-off (apology for action). Cost is legible on-page in the bottle's emptiness and Vera's ragged breathing, charging the final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (imperfect atonement, legacy vs. scandal) emerges through specific particulars—the wire setup, the empty bottle, the doomed orchard. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "imperfect was enough." Subtext operates powerfully in Eleanor's metaphorical speech ("stone that diverts the water"). No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (gossip columnist noticing "secrets" and "excavating"). Voice modulates under pressure ("The words tore out of Vera's chest"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext (Eleanor's delayed, metaphorical replies). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs ("light that refused to fully commit to visibility"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the confrontation and breathing in the quiet close. Zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final line lands with resonant, image-driven cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gossip columnist and spirit-medium is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through grounded, specific choices in character guilt and the tactile, imperfect ritual. Risk-taking (lyrical metaphysical mechanics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
