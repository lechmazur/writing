<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion in "haunted euphoria." Her final choice to become the bridge is earned through prior causality and visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost of grief and joy is legible in "Grief lived in this act... But joy lived here too," and the covenant's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jetty at twilight functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; sensory details like "sea lavender" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's archival perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density increase in texture and reflection; Maren's agency in retracing the covenant forces a trade-off between loss and continuity with felt cost, meeting the lens requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the ending reweights preservation without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through the image of "making time visible."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature; POV is stable and prose rhythm heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, as in "the hour between stories."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsional with no loops or artifacts; sentence-level control varies naturally, e.g., "The ink emerged rich and deep, the color of memory itself."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archivist, covenant, and ink-making feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes of memory into a fresh, emotionally truthful narrative.</comment>
