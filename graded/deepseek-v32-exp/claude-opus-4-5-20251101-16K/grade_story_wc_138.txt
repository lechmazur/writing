<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vael's corrosive boredom and longing for closure are concrete and character-particular, driving the final choice. The interiority is strong, though the emotional state is monolithic, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the established obsession and the amulet's curse. Pain's "mortal beauty" is a standout embodied moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Decisive Change hybrid) with clear, felt cost: the released amulet and empty escondite. The spatial mutiny and storm provide coherent, taught pressure that pays off at the threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is indispensable, fracturing light and surveillance, groaning under the storm, and ultimately shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated with Vael's perception. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image of the empty sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what comes after goodbye) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the accumulative lens via the intensifying solar storm and spatial mutiny. Vael's agency—using the amulet, then releasing it—drives the final, costly choice. The pressure tightens meaningfully to the rift's edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from image and event, resisting statement. The central question ("What happens after goodbye?") finds a resonant, non-literal answer in the "profound, terrifying peace of completion." Subtext is rich in the final image of the empty escondite and the "hushed thunder" of presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. The voice is distinct: lyrical, cosmic, and weary, with a perceptual signature perfectly matched to an ancient, dimensionally aware immortal. Rhythmic control is excellent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include slight repetition of "prismatic escondite" and a hint of thesaurus-churn ("dormant malevolence"). These do not touch the closure beat or obscure causality. Information density is very high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of immortal boredom, dimensional awareness, and cosmic-scale spatial mutiny. Familiar tropes are transformed through specific, grounded longing and a consistently lyrical, accumulative approach. The core premise is committed to fully, resulting in a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
