<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and driven by consistent traits; her shift from tinkerer to singer under pressure is earned with embodied emotion. The final choice to restore practices stems from prior causality and carries visible cost (aching throat, transformed arbor).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (arbor's revival, Mira's resolve); causal lens holds tightly from problem through journal discovery to sung remedy. Orientation is immediate, and the harvest moon constraint shapes tactics meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details (twisted vines, pale moon) are selective, vivid, and filtered through Mira's urgency, reinforcing stakes and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the arbor) escalates via Mira's agency under causal lens; the turn to forgotten songs narrows options and delivers unmistakable cost in her effort and the arbor's responsive transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("sacred practices were simply promises kept") without moralizing, earned through Mira's struggle and realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice carries a distinct lyrical, perceptual signature that mirrors Mira's whimsical attention. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., journal discovery) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("small green flames") is consistent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tinkering, tradition, and ecological attention feels inevitable; specific details (journal, songs, harvest moon) transform familiar tropes through grounded stakes and emotional truth.</comment>
