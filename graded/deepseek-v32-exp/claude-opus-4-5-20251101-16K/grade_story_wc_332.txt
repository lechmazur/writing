<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her interiority is concrete and embodied. The final choice to vitalize the palette is earned by the photograph's discovery, with cost felt in the shift from "luminous absence" to presence. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses of seeking and accepting are dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (mother transformed into light) with on-page cost in the reconfiguration of absence. Orientation is clear within 120 words; structure of two shards (archive, lighthouse) coheres with one meaningful tightening via the boat photograph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the Whispering Archipelago pressures choices (Color Pilgrimages) and charges the final image; the palette and camera function as micro-settings that constrain and enable. Sensory detail is selective and vivid, filtered through Mira's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection with mother) escalates via protagonist agency—photography leads to discovery of boat silhouette—under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of loss. One meaningful deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss, memory, and art emerges through particulars without statement; subtext operates in light, color, and whispering. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer (mixing water into palette) that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable and apt; voice is lyrical with distinct perceptual signature (librarian/photographer). No head‑hopping; prose rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high‑density, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, art, and magical setting feels organic and inevitable. Risk‑taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of familiar tropes through specific detail.</comment>
