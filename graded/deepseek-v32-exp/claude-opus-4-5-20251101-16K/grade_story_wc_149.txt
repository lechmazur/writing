<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, with motives clear and final understanding earned. The ghost bride's motivation drives the plot, and her mournful elation is vividly rendered. Minor lack of deeper internal contradiction in Elias, but cost is legible at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (bead crumbling, dawn breaking). The debt-repayment arc is logically sound and reconfigures stakes with resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the alchemical orchard and carved bead charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, constraining the awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) escalates through the ghost's revelations, driven by her agency and Elias's questioning. Cost is unmistakable in the bead's destruction and her fading, though Elias's agency is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of poisoned love and connection emerges through particulars, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in imagery and dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and lyrical, and dialogue (though minimal) carries subtext. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts obscuring clarity. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride, alchemical orchard, and reincarnation tropes through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off with coherence.</comment>
