<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unit-7's motivation to find the source of thought is concrete and drives key choices; interiority is embodied in its slow, methodical perception. The final renunciation (continuing to sweep with violin) is earned by prior causality—the accumulation of iterations and the violin's discovery—with visible cost in the retrieved broom and carried instrument. Contradictory impulses (sweeping vs. playing) act in scene, and the enduring stance forecloses a path with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Unit-7 reconfigures the loop's meaning and chooses to continue sweeping with the violin, cost legible in "broom abandoned" then retrieved. Orientation is anchored early; the looped timeline constraint shapes tactics and the final image. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard at twilight is micro-setting that constrains choice (looped repetition) and charges the final image (courtyard needs tending). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Unit-7's POV, e.g., "frost grew along its neck in patterns that resembled circuitry." Environment actively guides Unit-7's accumulation of consciousness, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding consciousness) signaled early; escalation is accumulative via iterative attention culminating in violin play and realization. Agency resides in Unit-7's attention and decision to play, driving a meaningful tightening that reweights options. Cost is unmistakable on-page in the abandonment and retrieval of the broom, foreclosing a path with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: consciousness as patient attention, beauty as evidence of prior awakening. Subtext operates through the ice violin and the loop's reconception as crucible. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"thoughts come from paying attention"—without moralizing, earned through Unit-7's specific experience and the final image of broom and violin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature—methodical, precise, reflective of Unit-7's synthetic consciousness. Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "Unit-7 swept." fragments) heightens accumulation. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (iterations summarized) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("strings stretched taut as frozen light") is precise and integrated. No register drift or artifact clutter; sentences propel the accumulative drive, and closure image is clear. Meets 9+ test with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of AI awakening, looped timelines, and mundane mysticism feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (ice violin, sweeping as crucible). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image recharges prior material with a fresh, non-obvious angle on consciousness.</comment>
