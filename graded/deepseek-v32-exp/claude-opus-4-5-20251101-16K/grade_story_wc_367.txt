<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is vivid with consistent traits and motivation embodied in her routine and prophetic laugh; however, the absence of on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost under the accumulative lens; structure is tight with clear early orientation and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and its mechanics constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in shaping futures escalates through Mira's agency in tilting the wick; cost is legible in the responsibility of steering, though pressure is subtle under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of ancient light versus modern darkness emerges organically from imagery and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature and rhythmic control are consistent, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats, though some sentences verge on purple without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh with a non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse lore and temporal steering; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
