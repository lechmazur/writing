<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is functional but lacks contradictory impulses; her final choice (ringing the bell) is motivated but the emotional cost of leaving home is told, not deeply embodied. The ghost's motivation is explained via note, which feels slightly expository for a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly. Closure is a decisive change (fleet departs, ghost released) with cost legible in "Veridian-7 crumbled behind them." Orientation is immediate; structure is tight with one meaningful tightening (the failing arches).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: floating arches and orchard planet pressure the escape; the butterfly bell charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and vivid ("amber skies," "bones of forgotten giants") and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (communal survival) escalates via ghost's messages and Mira's agency. Cost is visible (abandoned home, ghost's departure). One meaningful tightening (arch failure) forces a trade-off, though the community conflict is resolved quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of hope and collective care emerge organically through the ghost's actions and the bell's reprise. Final line ("Brambled hope was still hope") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight risk of sentimentality in butterfly image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perception. Voice is lyrical but controlled, with purposeful compression ("floating rock arches drifted... like bones"). Dialogue is minimal but effective in summary; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with strong rhythmic variation and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear. Minor overwriting in "brambled hope" phrase feels slightly decorative but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of altruistic ghost on alien planet is fresh; specific details (chalk messages, butterfly bell) synthesize into an organic whole. The premise avoids cliché and transforms familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
