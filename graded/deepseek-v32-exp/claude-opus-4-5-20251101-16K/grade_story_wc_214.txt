<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied, her motivation to find strength in vulnerability dramatized through micro-choices (holding the glass, sweeping as act of faith). The final stance—Earned Stasis in her embrace of solitude and purpose—is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her renunciation felt in the image of "data that no one would analyze." A slight tendency toward abstract reflection ("spiritually curious") is anchored by immediate, tactile action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) landing on the final paragraph: "she had learned that some lights burn brightest when no one is watching." The cost is legible in the preceding line—"data that no one would analyze"—and the persistent constraint of solitude shapes the entire narrative. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The station setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Maren's professional and personal bias (the broom's rhythm, the hum of machines). The "yellow lantern glass" functions as a micro-setting that reweights the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening cadence shift: Maren's empathetic tracing of the meteors' paths tightens into the realization that strength lies "in choosing to illuminate" the fall. The dominant stake (finding meaning in isolation) is signaled early and reweighted through density increase. The cost—accepting forgotten purpose—is felt and visible on the page, foreclosing the path of longing for remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (strength in vulnerability, beauty in transience) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the sweeping, the meteors' destruction, the yellow glass. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the station turning, "holding its keeper as gently as she held its purpose." No moralizing; subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Maren's solitude and curiosity. The voice modulates with lyrical precision under pressure ("calligraphy written in fire"). Rhythmic control is excellent, with syntax breathing in step with reflective beats. No head-hopping; all elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variance without artifacts. Figurative language ("the universe bled light," "primal elegance in maintenance") is consistent, coherent, and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative, meditative momentum perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "cosmic janitor" premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of solitude and cosmic scale. Emotional truth and specificity avoid template plots; the perspective feels memorable and authentic. The transformation of the familiar "strength in vulnerability" trope through the lens of celestial mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
