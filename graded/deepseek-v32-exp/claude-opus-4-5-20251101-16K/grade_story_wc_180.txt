<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction (pride vs. longing) acts in scene; her final choice to teach Sera is earned by the ribbon reveal and bag contents, with cost legible in "something deciduous... returning to bloom." Embodied emotion ("breath caught," "laughed despite herself") and micro-choices under pressure (tying the ribbon) reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; the generational reconciliation feels inevitable from established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Sera's arrival → ribbon revelation → bag evidence → Mira's decision. Closure is a Decisive Change (Mira commits to teaching) with resonant reconfiguration; cost is felt in the deciduous heart image and the weight of past estrangement. Orientation anchored within 120 words (cathedral orchard, workbench). Persistent constraint (guild betrayal, family silence) shapes tactics and the final promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (cathedral orchard) and micro-objects (ribbon, workbench) charge the final image and constrain choice: the ribbon ties Mira's wrist as a vow; the rafters isolate yet foster growth. Sensory detail selective and POV-filtered ("green-filtered light," "pears hung heavy"). The environment mirrors internal cycles (deciduous vows) without overt symbolism, essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom/healing estrangement) escalates through causal linkages: Sera's persistence, identity reveal, and bag proof tighten pressure on Mira. Agency is Mira's decisive choice to teach, foreclosing isolation with cost visible in her emotional surrender. One meaningful tightening (ribbon moment) reweights options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (deciduous vows—cycles of loss/renewal) emerges from particulars (orchard, ribbon, lenses) without statement. Subtext operates in gesture (tying the ribbon) and dialogue indirection. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "new growth" image, reweighting prior material. No moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) stable with distinct perceptual signature (craft-focused, reflective). Voice lyrical yet precise; dialogue natural and goal-driven (Sera's feisty challenges). Diction and syntax reflect Mira's professional lexicon and emotional state under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflection anchors present choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("deciduous vows," "leaves preparing their annual surrender") is consistent and charges closure. No artifice muddles peak beats; read-aloud ear test passes with varied syntax and concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of generational conflict, artisan craft, and symbolic setting feels organic and inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific detail (quartz-eye mending, cathedral orchard). Risk-taking in lyrical metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid template plots; closure reconfigures familiar material with ingenuity.</comment>
