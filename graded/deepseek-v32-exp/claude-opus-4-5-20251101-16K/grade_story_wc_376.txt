<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her gilded-leaf physiology and wilting near dishonesty are embodied traits that drive micro-choices. The final decision to create a map arises from earned causality and carries visible cost in her renewed purpose. The attendant applies secondary pressure, and Mira's internal conflict (fear vs. hope) is concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; inciting incident (finding shredded map) triggers because/therefore chain to the Repository. Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira's discovery of her mother's words and her resolution to create a map, with cost legible in the shimmering leaves and purpose. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the toxic sky and domes pressure survival, the Conversation Hall's decay mirrors lost candor. Mira's gilded skin functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding lost conversations) escalates through Mira's agency: from piecing map to speaking truth at the door to hearing her mother's message. Cost is felt in her emotional release and new resolve. One meaningful tightening (entering Repository) forecloses earlier uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth, loss, and preservation emerges organically from particulars (shredded map, zinc plate, preserved voices). Subtext operates through imagery (leaves, gilding). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via Mira's map-making, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with perceptual signature (noticing honesty through physical sensation). Dialogue is minimal but natural; prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control; figurative language ("fern retreating from frost") is purposeful. Minor over-density in early description ("filtered air of her studio") does not harm closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with metaphysical quest for lost conversations; gilded-leaf calligrapher and Repository of the Unfinished are specific, non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
