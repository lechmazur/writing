<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied; micro-choices under pressure (keeping label, transcribing) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of named existence earned via accumulative texture, with cost legible in poisoned-label reminder. Slight passivity in external action offset by lens-consistent agency in attention and collection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held cleanly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where collected voices become "something like a self." Orientation anchored early; cost on-page in "erasure comes for everyone" and the final image of tides keeping time for an erased woman. No causality breaks; pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipping-container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges closure. Sensory detail (groaning metal, salt air) filtered through POV; recurring blue container and poison label shape choice and final image. Economy and purpose in every detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density increase: layering fragments tightens stake (texture of memories vs. meaning). Agency in collection and reflection; cost legible when tracing poison label reweights her erased existence. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through particulars (overheard fragments, poison label) without statement. Ending offers non-literal answer: self built from others' memories reweights prior material. Subtext in gestures like folding label; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct with lyric, accumulative rhythm reflecting collector's mind. Perceptual signature: filters reality through salvaged memories. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., her past) taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose polished, high information density; sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythmic variety supports accumulative drive. Closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: bureaucratic death, container-labyrinth life, memory-collector premise transformed through specific texture and voice. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
