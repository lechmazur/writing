<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction (scavenging fragments vs. confronting her ghost) is embodied in scene; her final renunciation—agreeing to carry regret—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in "the regret arrived whole." No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific, concrete perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira accepts the weight of regret, with cost legible on-page. Orientation is clear early, and the halted carousel serves as a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and camera wheel function as micro-setting that constrains choice (wading, confronting ghost) and charges the final image (light catching the wheel). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens: density increases via the camera wheel memory and ghost confrontation, driven by Mira's agency. Cost is unmistakable in her sitting with regret, foreclosing the path of scattering oneself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and self-acceptance emerges through particulars (camera wheel, collected stories) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: peace by carrying weight, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, time-scattered prose reflects Mira's state. Rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., ghost dialogue) and no head-hopping; any elision (time confusion) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear; no register drift or artifacts in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of surreal setting and intimate regret; risk-taking in the ghost confrontation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration feels inevitable in hindsight, with specificity anchoring universals.</comment>
