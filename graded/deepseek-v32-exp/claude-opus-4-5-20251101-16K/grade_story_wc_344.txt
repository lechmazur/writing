<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded; interiority concrete through gear handling and reflections. Final realization earned with cost in trembling hands and ticking mechanism. Contradictory impulses not simultaneously acted in scene, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: Vera assembles clock and understands repair through time, cost felt in carrying her father home. Accumulative lens holds, orientation early, escalation via mirror insight. Prophecy setup pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library and hall of mirrors vividly constrain choice by showing reflections guiding repair. Sensory details selective and purposeful, charging final image where mirrors soften. Environment integral to theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal repair, escalating accumulatively as mirrors reveal damage like grief. Agency in gear work leads to deepening with cost in emotional release. One meaningful tightening suffices under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from gears, mirrors, repair; ending offers non-literal answer: locks open with time, broken things heal when we grow. Subtext in reflections and scent enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with lyrical, perceptually signature voice filtering setting through grief. Rhythmic control varies with emotional intensity; purposeful elision (prophecy) paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose dense and propelled, varied sentence rhythms, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent and clear. High information density advances story and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of locksmith, frozen library, clockmaker gears feels inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific emotional detail; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
