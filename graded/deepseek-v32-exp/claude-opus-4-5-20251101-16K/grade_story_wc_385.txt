<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; her final choice to sing is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete, though internal contradiction is minimal. The cost is conceptual but legible in the Keeper's flight and the dead's choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a charged poise with cost on the page (the Keeper flees, Mira understands). The persistent constraint of the shell shapes tactics, and the closure effect lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details; the serpentine nexus and the seashell constrain choice and charge the final image. Setting is integral to plot and atmosphere, functioning as a micro-setting that alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why some echo) is signaled early; escalation through dialogue and Mira's song tightens options. Cost is legible in the Keeper's flight and the reconfigured power dynamic. Agency is clear and drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of choice and legacy emerges through images and events, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in whispers and hum, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Dialogue is natural and advances plot. Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished prose with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concept of echo singers and Keepers; fresh world-building integrated through character and stakes. Turns feel earned in hindsight; emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
