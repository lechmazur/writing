<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s analytical nature and personal stake are concretely embodied through micro-choices (photographing, not sharing) and interior contradiction (clinical method vs. trembling hands). The final renunciation—withholding the truth—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: death as displacement, love persisting across time. The cost is legible in Elara’s decision to keep the discovery secret and the glowing snow globe image. Causal steps (discovery of transmission, snow globe) lead cleanly to this reconfiguration under a Hybrid lens that holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library and snow globe are vivid, pressure‑specific, and charge the final image. Sensory details (gloved hand, swirling sediment) are filtered through Elara’s professional bias. The object‑as‑setting constrains choice and deepens closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closure about her mother) escalates through Elara’s agency in finding the transmission and snow globe. The tightening forces a trade‑off: she gains understanding but forfeits sharing it, with cost unmistakable in the final ascent and withheld log.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of non‑linear time and letting go emerges through concrete particulars (snow globe, transmission) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—the lighthouse glowing impossibly—that reweights prior material and lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature blending analytical precision and lyrical reflection. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., “hands trembled” then clinical noting). No head‑hopping; elision (the message content) is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“companionable death,” “frequencies the living could not always detect”) is controlled and heightens closure. Information density is high without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of deep‑sea exploration, temporal displacement, and personal grief feels fresh and inevitable. Risk‑taking (conceptual repricing over plot twist) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (snow globe, lighthouse) are irreplaceable and charge the ending.</comment>
