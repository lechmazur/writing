<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her retrocognitive gift and philosophical conviction. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (positioning shards, touching the hush). The final hopeful endurance is earned by four years of labor, though the abstract nature of her goal slightly limits visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (beacon rekindled, hope extended) with cost legible in the limited reach and years of effort. Orientation is immediate and clear. The pattern of coincidences and star-tracking culminates in a decisive change that reweights the story's premise without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass pavilion and broken prism constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (humming panes, starlight). Setting is fully integrated into action and theme, shaping tactics and atmosphere with no inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of detail and Mira's precise actions, culminating in the beacon's rekindling. Agency is clear; cost is visible in the beacon's reduced reach and her years of work. Dominant stake (proving meaning in coincidence) is tightened through her final attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and events—the prism's visions, the beacon's light—offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of meaning. Subtext operates in silence and implication (shard of hush, thistle-blown hope). No moralizing; complexity and ambiguity linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, reflective voice that matches Mira's perception. Diction and syntax are controlled, creating a perceptual signature (e.g., "glass humming pavilion," "thistle-blown hope"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddling clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates to the climax and breathes in reflective moments, all serving closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, mystical, and hopeful elements feels organic and inevitable. Specific details (retrocognition, shard of hush) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure recharges all prior material.</comment>
