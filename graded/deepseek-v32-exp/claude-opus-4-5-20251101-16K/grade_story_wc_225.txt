<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and motivated, with embodied interiority ("fierce repose settled into her bones") and a micro-choice-driven arc from seeking absolution to finding purpose in work. The final choice of self-forgiveness is earned by the causality of her untangling labor and its quiet conclusion. A slight deduction for a moment of abstract articulation ("forgiveness was not earned through suffering, but chosen through grace") that edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) as Mira's internal shift and the village's unfreezing occur simultaneously with clear, felt cost ("trembling," "the ordinary, beautiful noise of the living world"). Orientation is immediate, pattern (frozen time, woven puzzle) is taught early and pays off decisively at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and functions as crucible and constraint. The frozen village and the tapestry are not just described but are the mechanisms of the plot; the "platinum labyrinth" directly constrains Mira's choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's analytical perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density and difficulty of the decoding work, tightening toward the final act of thread-pulling. The dominant stake (Mira's quest for peace) deepens and is reweighted through her engagement with the puzzle. Cost is legible in her bleeding fingers and the emotional release at closure. A minor softening: the external threat to the village remains vague, slightly limiting the stakes' concrete counter-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness through purposeful work, not suffering) emerges organically from the woven puzzle and Mira's arc. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the rain and noise replacing the "woven hush"—that reweights the prior stillness. Subtext operates powerfully in the tapestry's stalemate solution mirroring Mira's internal release. Avoids moralizing; the insight is earned through the specific labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (chess tutor's analytical eye). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. A minor register drift occurs in the final philosophical sentence ("forgiveness was not earned..."), which momentarily steps outside the established textured interiority, creating a slight tonal bulge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of artifacts. Figurative language ("woven hush," "fierce repose") is cohesive and pattern-taught. A minor template cadence appears in two consecutive "She had [verb]..." sentences in the backstory paragraph, and one instance of near-paraphrase ("She had not found absolution... She had found something harder..."). These do not touch closure but create a slight scaffold echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess logic, woven magic, and psychological redemption feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (the platinum labyrinth as a chess problem of stalemate). The emotional truth is specific and avoids generic templates. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off with a charged final image.</comment>
