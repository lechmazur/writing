<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. desire) act in scene; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "hollow space where faith once lived"). Final choice to remove crown is earned by prior causality with visible cost—abandoning her kingdom. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Thessaly removes crown and chooses transformation) with on-page cost ("a kingdom slept, dreaming of a queen who would not return"). Causal lens holds: dreams → climb → encounter → choice. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "air thinned," "silver plumes"). The grotto's environment directly pressures the climax, shaping transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between queenly duty and transformation) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens. The choice to remove crown forecloses a live option with unmistakable cost. Pressure tightens via climb and confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (disenchantment vs. re-enchantment) emerges through events and imagery (bleeding starlight, fireflies). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic, rhythmically controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character's lexicon. Dialogue minimal but natural, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "bleeding starlight") is coherent and vivid, never muddling clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes via specific, grounded choices (e.g., shadow-self as alternate path). Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
