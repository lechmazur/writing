<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Her internal conflict between pride and forgiveness is dramatized in scene, and the final choice to release her letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her tears and healing wounds. No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; causal drive lens holds with Vera's quest leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The ending lands on-page with felt cost: "she let the tears come" and "the slow knitting of damaged flesh." The shard and moonlight constraint shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV; the mangrove labyrinth and spirits pressure choices, while the shard and moonlight function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding unsent letters) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the causal lens, tightening through spirit messages to a personal realization. Cost is legible in her emotional and physical pain, foreclosing the path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; subtext operates through condensation messages and the release of the letter. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "two siblings would keep learning how to speak."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is character-specific. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains clear. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole; the medium concept, unsent letters, and mangrove setting are transformed through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels earned.</comment>
