<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's prosopagnosia is a consistent, specific flaw that drives her quest and final insight. Her epiphany ("The limit was the doorway") is earned through the concrete, tactile experience with the coin, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to embrace her constraint as her gift is a credible, charged endurance with a visible cost (leaving the library to collapse).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and a live clock until the coin's revelation reconfigures Mira's understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her walk away, carrying the coin, crystallizes a new artistic stance. Cost is legible in the "distant thunder" of collapse and the foreclosed path of her old method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly specific and exerts direct pressure (the imminent demolition). The coin functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice, demanding tactile exploration and directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (bark-lined walls, dust sifting, coin's indentations).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving true artistic insight) escalates through the literal time pressure of the demolition and the deepening mystery of the coin. The decisive tightening is Mira's tactile reading of the coin, an act of agency that narrows options (abandoning visual reliance) and changes knowledge. The cost is the library's destruction, a tangible loss that makes her gain irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (constraint enabling infinity) emerges organically from character (face blindness), object (fractal coin), and action (tactile discovery). The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "They were the very shape of her gift." Subtext is rich in the coin's message and Vane's parallel struggle, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's perceptual signature (noticing "geometry of wrinkles," "fractally precise patterns"). Lyrical, rhythmic prose modulates with pressure ("A rumble shook the library...Minutes now."). No head-hopping; all reflection is anchored in present stimuli.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative strain in "patient giants" feels slightly decorative. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance character and atmosphere. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the coin description conveys theme, character, and plot).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, fractal art theory, and a condemned library is fresh and specific. The core concept is transformed through lived character detail, not a template. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off with a resonant image (coin in pocket, walking toward studio). The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
