<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; interiority is concrete ("hollow space inside her chest"). Contradictory impulses shown through abandoned faith vs. draw to heritage. Final choice to return is earned by prior beats with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("hollow space... began to fill"). Orientation is clear early; pattern of discoveries tightens meaning. Sundial base acts as persistent constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vividly specific and constrains choice; roots-between-bones motif charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's perspective. Environment is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith) escalates accumulatively through Mira's agency; cost is legible in her cautious rebuilding. The sundial discovery deepens stakes and forces a reconfiguration of her journey. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and continuity emerges organically from particulars; no moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sundial and roots imagery. Subtext is rich and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet precise, with a clear perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Purposeful elision (e.g., reflection) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character and atmosphere without obscuring closure. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of catacomb orchard is fresh; synthesis of diaspora, archaeology, and faith feels organic and inevitable. Specific details transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective plot heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
