<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vereth's motivation is clear and embodied, but the absence of internal contradiction or personal cost limits depth; her unwavering certainty lacks the flawed struggle that would elevate the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (the thaw) and conceptual cost (dissolution of old boundaries); causal lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the ban shapes her return and tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vividly rendered and actively charge the final image; the quartz colonnade constrains choice and participates in the climax, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vereth's agency (paraphrasing) and tightens causally, with stakes fully realized in the thaw; cost is conceptual but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as membranes emerges through concrete action and image; the thaw offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic, stable POV with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice remains controlled under pressure, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with high information density and no figurative muddle; closure image is clear and uncluttered by loops, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic craft and world-changing action feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though capped due to global gate.</comment>
