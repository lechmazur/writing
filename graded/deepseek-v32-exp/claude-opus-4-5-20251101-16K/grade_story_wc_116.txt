<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly realized with consistent motivation and embodied interiority, but lacks internal contradiction or dynamic change, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant earned stasis with legible cost in the crumbling library and the keeper's regenerative cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and charges the final image of decay and renewal, though it does not actively constrain choices; sensory detail is purposeful and woven throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through density under the accumulative lens; cost is felt in the keeper's need for silence and the library's persistent decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of non-judgmental witness emerges organically from images and actions; subtext is deep, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal affirmation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature; no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details like the origami swan and regenerative silence; risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with coherence.</comment>
