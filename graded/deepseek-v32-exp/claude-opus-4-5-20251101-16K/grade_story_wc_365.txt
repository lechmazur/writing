<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses; Vera's motivation ("the unbearable heaviness of not knowing") is embodied in micro-choices like recording sensations, and her final redirect is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as Vera steps backward, cost legible in "the weight of revelation"; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from shard flares to discovery of "REDIRECT," orienting clearly early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and functional; the repair bay and green shard constrain choices and charge the final image, filtered through Vera's sensory map-maker POV with purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth) escalates through Vera's agency; the "REDIRECT" turn narrows options and forces a trade-off with cost felt in "the texture of resolve" and fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of weight and truth emerges through particulars like the shard and symbol; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with sensory precision and stable POV; perceptual signature reflects Vera's profession, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, and sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of multiverse travel with emotional truth; tropes transformed through specific details like sensory mapping, and turns feel earned with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
