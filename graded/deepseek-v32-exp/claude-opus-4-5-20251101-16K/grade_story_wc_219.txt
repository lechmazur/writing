<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and her motivation (scientific inquiry into homecoming) clear and intensifies. The final choice to descend and join the gathering feels earned by her preceding realization. However, the "luminous skeptic" and "academically rebellious" traits are more label than crucible, with insufficient on-page contradiction or cost tied directly to these traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through imagery and reflection to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure. The cost—the tragic beauty of human yearning versus Visitor freedom—is legible in the final fly amber image. Structure is a single, coherent scene with a clear orientation and a resonant, inevitable ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric ("rainwashed tower," "bronze quiet," "overgrown sculpture path"). The environment and the key object (fly amber) are not just decorative; they charge the final image and constrain the action (the converging footprints guide the journey). Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Vera's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the human need for homecoming) escalates cleanly from private research to shared convergence. The tightening is the realization that the pilgrimage is no longer "artificial," forcing a reconfiguration of Vera's goal. Cost is the conceptual trade-off between human rootedness and Visitor freedom, felt in the final amber image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fly amber, the tower, and the act of convergence. Subtext is rich (the amber as suspended yearning). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—homecoming as the "ache," not the destination—that reweights all prior material without moralizing. Deeply integrated and poignant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited to Vera. Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that blends scientific observation and poetic reflection ("the chemistry is just the shadow of something else"). Rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative, contemplative pressure. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant, concise, and highly dense, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph is a masterclass in resonant closure. A single, very minor hesitation: "bronze quiet" is repeated, but this reads as a taught, purposeful motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of first-contact SF with a lyrical meditation on nostalgia is fresh and insightful. The core concept (artificial pilgrimage) is transformed through specific, grounded character choices. The fly amber motif is uniquely deployed and indispensable. The story commits fully to its premise and achieves a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
