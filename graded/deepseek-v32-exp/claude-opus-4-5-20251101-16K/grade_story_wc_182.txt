<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and shifts credibly from extraction to preservation, driven by her expertise and the time traveler's revelation. The time traveler's exhaustion and the girl's determination are distinct, but Vera's internal conflict is underplayed; the final choice, while earned, lacks contradictory impulses in scene. The cost of the new mission is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (rescue redefined as transcription) with legible cost in the time traveler's 47 failures and the girl's refusal. The ending image ("The mountain sang.") reconfigures the premise without exposition. Minor deduction for the time traveler's arrival being a slight convenience, but it integrates without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (gaps, narrowing passages) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Vera's expertise. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though the 9+ quick test is satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue) escalates through Vera's agency: she renegotiates the mission, forcing a trade-off between extraction and preservation. Cost is legible in the time traveler's failures and the commitment to transcribe. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the redefined rescue, subtext in the unheard symphony and gaps. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the mountain sings) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV (Vera) with distinct perceptual signature (linguist's attention to detail). Dialogue is natural and advances plot; time traveler's voice is distinct. Rhythmic control is strong, though diction occasionally elevates without jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor simile ("like the first note of a symphony") is slightly pat but not muddled. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements (mountain bookstore, library of unlearned lessons, time traveler). The turn from extraction to preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with a quiet, conceptual ending heightens stakes. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
