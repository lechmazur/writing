<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure (leaning into the camera, pressing the pendant). Motivation (find where unused love is stored) is clear and compels the search. The final stance (seeing as healing) is earned through the camera's revelation, with a felt cost in the released "knot." Slight abstraction in the past-life memory does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (seeing as healing) with cost legible in the release of the "knot." Orientation is clear within 120 words. Single scene, causality intact. The simple structure is effective but lacks multi-beat complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (twilight viaduct, wisteria) and functions as micro-setting: the wisteria becomes the vessel for unused love, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated into action. However, Q2 is not ≥9.0, so cap at 8.8 per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for unused love) is signaled early; escalation under Accumulative lens occurs via density increase (breath change, inverted vision) leading to the wisteria revelation. Cost is visible in the chest release. Agency is attentional, driving the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (camera obscura, Kwan Yin's tear, wisteria). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("seeing was its own form of healing") without moralizing. Slight explicitness in stating the search does not undermine earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical, perceptual signature. Diction matches the artist's spiritual curiosity; rhythm varies purposefully. No head-hopping. Slight poetic abstraction is voice-motivated. No artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and strong rhythm. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is consistent and character-apt. However, Q2 is not ≥9.0, so cap at 8.8 per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise (search for where unused love is stored) is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with camera obscura and spiritual pilgrimage. The wisteria as vessels of love is an original inflection. Avoids cliché, offering a specific artistic stance.</comment>
