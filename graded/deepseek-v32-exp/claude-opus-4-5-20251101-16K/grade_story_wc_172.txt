<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's guilt and penance are concretely embodied through actions like following cracks and placing the egg. Internal conflict between philanthropy and destruction drives the narrative to a credible, cost-laden endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative texture builds to a charged poise closure with rain and salt; cost is legible in "It was not enough," and the lens holds without causality breaks.</comment>
