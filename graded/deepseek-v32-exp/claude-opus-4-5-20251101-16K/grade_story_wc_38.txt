<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (lyrical code breaker, daughter seeking truth). Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "she felt too much" transformed into strength. The final choice (readiness for escape) is earned by prior decoding and planning, with cost implied in the risk. Lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she decoded the journal, she plans the escape. Closure is a Charged Poise (ready, dice waiting) with undeniable pressure and cost felt in the imminent risk. Persistent constraints (sunken lab, guards, time) shape tactics. Orientation is clear within first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (sunken lab) is vividly sensory and pressures choices (depth, isolation, ventilation routes). Recurring object (hangman's dice) constrains decoding and charges the final image. Micro-setting (console, observation window) integrates with action. No generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberation of prisoners) is signaled early via the journal. Escalation is driven by Marina's agency: decoding → planning → imminent execution, tightened by the three-hour clock. Cost is legible in the risk of failure. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (calm defiance, vulnerability as strength) emerges through concrete images: dance as rebellion, dice spelling "LIV", spider web metaphor. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Marina) is stable and apt. Voice is lyrical and distinct, with rhythmic control ("pressure transformed silence into something tangible"). No head-hopping. Perception is filtered through her professional and emotional lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Information density high (e.g., dice, dance, journal entries advance multiple layers). No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: code breaker who dances, sunken lab, hangman's dice as cipher. The calm defiance concept is transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking (dance as method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
