<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta’s characterization is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (carving as containment) rooted in a clear, consistent motive. Her practical grief and internal contradiction (holding/releasing) are dramatized, not summarized. The final stance—lifting the gouge in "rust-hued peace"—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is filtered through specific perception and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout, building via reflective density and present action toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image ("a lioness began to breathe"). Orientation is immediate and anchors the reflective pattern. The taught mosaic of memory and present action coheres, and the constraint of the kettle's timeframe shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is a pressure chamber: the rain-beaded skylight loft filters light and mood, the ash wood blank constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "amber suspension," "soft resistance"). The micro-setting (bench, tools, kettle) is woven into action and shapes the protagonist's options and the story's cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Marta's internal conflict with grief and impermanence) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative deepening. Protagonist agency (the decision to carve, the realization about "here and gone") drives the escalation under the textural lens. Cost is legible in her acceptance and the final charged poise. One meaningful tightening (the kettle's boil) provides a live constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (carving, rain, lions) without moralizing. The core concept "here and gone" is repriced through specific experience, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image. Subtext operates in gesture and silence. Earned wisdom arises from dramatized struggle, avoiding platitudes and thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose texture reflects Marta's mindful, grieving consciousness. Purposeful compression of time and memory is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally. The voice remains coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the scene's breath. Figurative language ("crystallized time," "amber suspension") is consistent and enhances clarity. No register drift or artifact clutter; the closure image is sharp and unblurred by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lion tamer's widow processing grief through wood carving—feels fresh, inevitable, and fully committed. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded detail and emotional honesty. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration is earned by prior particulars, not a late rule change.</comment>
