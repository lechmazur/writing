<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vesna's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, but contradictory impulses do not act in scene, preventing a higher score. Her final stance—continuing the rebellion—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal plot with tight because/therefore linkage; closure lands as a Charged Poise (swaying dance) with legible cost under a consistent lens. The nostalgia ban constrains tactics, and the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (sanctuary from ban) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through Vesna's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resisting memory ban) escalates through Vesna's agency in tattooing Cael; cost is felt in her eternal exile and renewed purpose. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as artful resistance emerges through concrete actions and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing gaps, cosmic connections). Poetic voice modulates with pressure, no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and artifact-free; rhythm varies naturally, imagery supports momentum, and no loops or figurative muddle obscure closure. High information density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, tattooing, and political resistance feels inevitable; concept is fully committed, transforming tropes through specific detail and risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
