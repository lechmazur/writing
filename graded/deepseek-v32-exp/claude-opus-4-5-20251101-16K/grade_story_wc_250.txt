<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guardian's silent empathy is consistent and embodied; girl's internal conflict shown through tremor and breathing, with earned calmness from light patterns. Guardian's motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars") is abstract but anchored in action. Minor weakness: guardian's mystical nature limits contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Charged Poise with felt cost in shared weeping and manufactured stars. Orientation clear within 120 words; single-scene structure tight. Persistent constraint of silence and tools shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective—cobalt dock, wet planks, canal—integrates with action; dental mirror and shutters as micro-setting constrain choice and charge final image. Sensory details purposefully reflect internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (girl's internal unwinding) signaled early; escalation via accumulative light patterns and emotional density, driven by guardian's agency. Cost legible in girl's weeping and guardian's effort to create stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy and light in darkness emerges from particulars—mirror, shutters, silence—without moralizing. Ending reweights prior material with resonant, non-literal answer ("darkness did not have to mean alone").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable with poetic, rhythmic voice; perceptual signature distinct (e.g., "glazed with the sky's residue"). No head-hopping; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven. Elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language consistent and purposeful (e.g., "stillness was spiralingly calm"). No loops, scaffold, or muddle; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis—silent guardian using dental mirror and light patterns—feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in non-verbal communication heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
