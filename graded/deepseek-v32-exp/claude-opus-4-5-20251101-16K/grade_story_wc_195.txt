<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Corwin's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (unsnapping gorget, uttering oath) revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of withdrawal is earned by prior causality with visible cost—his vulnerability. A minor archetypal tinge does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost on the page ("his bare throat felt the cold air... vulnerable and alive"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, taught early via sensory density and pattern-walking, leading to a decisive internal change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is indispensable, constraining choice (patterns must be walked) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Corwin's perception, with the "factually mystical" night integrated into the world logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (possibility vs. sealed fate) escalates through Corwin's agency—walking patterns, unsnapping armor, swearing allegiance—under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his vulnerable throat and the program's dissolution, reweighting options without external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through concrete particulars (theater program, gorget, oath) without moralizing. The final "yes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, though the concept of "allegiance" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature filtered through Corwin's withdrawn then opening consciousness. Rhythmic control under pressure, purposeful compression, and no head-hopping. Voice coheres from first line to last.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Peak beats ("the click echoed impossibly") maintain clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of withdrawn knight, alchemical greenhouse, and marionette-program patterns feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity and risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection in the final "yes."</comment>
