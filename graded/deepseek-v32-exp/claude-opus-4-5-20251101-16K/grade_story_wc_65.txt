<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the final decision is earned by prior causality and embodied tension. Minor diagnostic labeling ("groundedly imaginative") is mitigated by dramatization, and the cost of three years' paralysis is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (she writes) with visible cost (the thawing lake). Orientation is immediate and anchors stakes; the faint-thread vision is integrated into her role, avoiding deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (spire, frozen lake, quill) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states and evolving with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (writing the right words) escalates via Mira's agency—her vision and decision—under causal lens; cost is legible in the thaw and her three-year paralysis, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sustaining transformation emerges from concrete images and events, not mere statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer. Slight thematic echo in naming the concept is offset by dramatization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; poetic yet controlled voice, no head-hopping. Minor register drift in abstract concepts remains within professional lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmically varied, and dense without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise (ignorance cartographer) is fresh and fully committed; synthesis of constraint, transformation, and legacy feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
