<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's meekness and quiet determination are embodied through concrete actions and interior contradiction; her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in calloused hands and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through shards; orientation clear early; constraint of resonance ore shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (floating arches, mines) actively constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens via density of repeated actions; protagonist agency drives stakes; cost legible in exhaustion, doubt, and stabilized arches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through particulars; ending offers a non-literal answer via Mira's continued work, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language ("azure defiance") is consistent and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse rebuilding with emotional specificity; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
