<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as witness; interiority is concrete through embodied action and micro-choices under pressure; final understanding earned by spiral arbitration with conceptual cost. Slight lack of contradictory impulses in scene limits peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with on-page cost ("seed not survivor"); orientation anchored early; spiral arbitration drives pattern toward legible before/after change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (library architecture guides journey); sensory details selective and purposeful, integrated with POV; final image charged by temple library and chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density in spiral arbitration; protagonist agency drives deepening through method; cost legible in transformation from witness to seed, reweighting stake under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endings/beginnings emerges organically from images and events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext woven through dictionary and arbitration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and stable with controlled rhythmic modulation; POV consistent; perceptual signature sharp; dialogue minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and pattern-taught; rhythm supports accumulative escalation without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and transformed through specific choices; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking with abstract concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
