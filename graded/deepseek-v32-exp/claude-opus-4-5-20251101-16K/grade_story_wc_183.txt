<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her chimera twin discovery; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion; the final choice to paint the name is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot is causal and tight; closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira finds the garden and paints the name, with cost legible in the warming solace; lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (the drifting ship forces her deeper); it charges the final image of the ship as keeper of forgotten names.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Mira's active search; the tightening occurs as she descends and finds the wall, with cost felt in the release of painting the name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and acknowledgment emerges naturally; the ending offers a non-literal answer (solace catching flame) that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice is distinct and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is effective and does not muddle peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific; the synthesis of chimera twin, abandoned carnival ship, and garden of names feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
