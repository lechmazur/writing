<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, but her steady professionalism lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the final choice is earned and carries visible cost through risk and ephemerality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with legible cost (the chalk will wash away, but Lyra will remember); the inferred Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The golden arcade and chalk function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's POV, creating a coherent atmosphere of futuristic nostalgia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Lyra) escalates through Mira's agency in creating the chalk code; cost is legible in Vera's trembling and the ephemeral nature of the solution under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in the margins emerges organically from concrete details (chalk, surface mail); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concept of pseudonym creator using surface mail is fresh and synthesized with specific, irreplaceable details (chalk, clipboard); the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
