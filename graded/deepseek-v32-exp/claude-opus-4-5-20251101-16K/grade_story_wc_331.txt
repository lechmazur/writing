<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited conviction, with embodied emotion (tears absorbed by scarf) and micro-choices under pressure. However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene, limiting internal conflict during the discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: finding the seam reawakens hope but defers the decision, with cost legible in her tears and the scarf's absorption. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the non-Euclidean architecture constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the library's hyperbolic geometry enables the seam, and the scarf as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where stories live—escalates through Mira's agency in mapping and discovery, culminating in a meaningful tightening when she feels the seam. Cost is felt in her silent tears and the deferred choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from analog memories and geometric search, with subtext in the scarf's layered use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, precise, aligned with Mira's expertise. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("dust motes frozen like words") serves closure, and information density is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific poetry, hyperbolic geometry, and analog memories feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
