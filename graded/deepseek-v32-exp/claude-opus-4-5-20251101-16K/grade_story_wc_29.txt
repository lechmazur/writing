<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes broadcast. Interiority is concrete and professional (“her stomach drop”). The final choice—to increase the amplitude—is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing a peaceful path with felt cost. Minor deduction for some telling of emotion (“felt her stomach drop”) where embodiment could be sharper, and the “cautiously hopeful” trait is stated rather than fully dramatized under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: Mira’s detection drives her interference, which provokes the reply, tightening options. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her as a worthy opponent, reconfiguring the game with undeniable conceptual cost (she has irrevocably engaged). Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure with one transition (to cosmic scale) is seamless. The cost is legible in the “grim” smile and the “long night” ahead, a price paid for engagement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is expertly integrated and constrains choice: the basement radio station’s “ancient broadcast array” and hidden transmitter are essential resources for her plan. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“hiss and crackle,” charts that “flutter as if touched by wind”). The micro-setting (the equipment, the charts) directly pressures and enables the key action. One minor weakness: the university division above is summarized rather than felt environmentally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exposing manipulation/preventing disastrous contact) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the causal lens. Mira’s agency drives the major turn—the broadcast—which narrows her options (from observer to active player) and triggers the higher-stakes reply. Cost is visible in the “screamed” signal and her “trembled” hands, confirming the engagement’s price. The escalation is meaningful and tightly linked to her choice, though the community division remains a secondary, reported pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of communication as contested, high-stakes gameplay emerges organically from the core conflict. Subtext operates in the tricksters’ amused reply and Mira’s refusal to just listen. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: outwitting tricksters requires talking back, a conceptual repricing of humanity’s role. No moralizing; the final image (“one interpreter refused to look away”) carries the thematic weight. A slight deduction for the near-thematic statement “to outwit cosmic tricksters, you couldn’t just listen to the universe. You had to talk back,” which, while earned, borders on explicit summation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV filtered through Mira’s professional expertise and urgency. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature (“communication windows—moments when something out there spoke”) and rhythmic control under pressure. The specialized lexicon is character-appropriate and consistent. No head-hopping. Dialogue (the tricksters’ message, her spoken reply) is functional and advances the plot, though her aloud statement is slightly explanatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. Sentence rhythm varies effectively with scene needs. Minor artifacts: the phrase “cautiously hopeful” is repeated in adjacent paragraphs, creating a slight paraphrase loop. A few filter verbs (“she knew,” “she felt”) are used where immediacy could be higher. No figurative muddle; the closure image remains crisp and unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core premise—first contact as a manipulative game of cosmic tricksters—offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar material. It’s transformed through specific, grounded choices in Mira’s method (subsonic scrambling) and the stakes of academic division. The synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (the silent, subsonic confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
