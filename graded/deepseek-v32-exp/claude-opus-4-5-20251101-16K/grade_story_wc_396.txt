<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vela's motivation as a peacekeeper who reconstitutes memories is clear and consistent, driving the plot. Her interiority is conveyed through embodied emotion (e.g., shadows pulsing) and micro-choices under pressure, though internal conflict is hinted rather than deeply dramatized. The final choice to help Sera is earned by her calling, with cost visible in her loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change for Sera and a resonant reconfiguration for Vela, both with felt cost (Vela's solitude, Sera's purpose). Causal lens holds tightly from fragment arrival to revelation. Orientation is anchored early; no plot breaks. Cost is legible in the final image of groaning ice floes and defiant apple trees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, from the lighthouse orchard to the vintage mirrors. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Vela's POV. The mirrors function as a micro-setting that charges the final image by enabling the reconstitution, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the mother's message) is signaled early and tightens through Vela's agency. One meaningful escalation occurs as glimpses coalesce into revelation, driving Sera's decision. Cost is unmistakable in Sera's emotional shift and Vela's enduring loneliness, though conflict resolution is swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reconstituting loss into direction emerges organically from events and imagery, without moralizing. Subtext operates in the mirrors' constellation and the mother's forgiveness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the concept of recovering hidden meanings, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV (Vela) is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice. Perceptual signature is consistent; dialogue is minimal but natural. Prose rhythm and diction reflect Vela's introspection, though occasional ornate phrasing slightly moderates the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly. No scaffold or loop artifacts; figurative language is controlled (e.g., "constellation of points of light"). Read-aloud rhythm supports emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes magical realism with emotional depth in a fresh, non-obvious way. The shadow-laced peacekeeper, memory reconstitution, and icy setting cohere into an organic vision. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
