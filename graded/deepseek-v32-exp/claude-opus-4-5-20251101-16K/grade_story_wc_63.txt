<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's guilt and atonement are embodied through specific rituals; internal conflict drives credible endurance with cost visible in the weight lifting during the pendulum's pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure in the pendulum's pause offers Charged Poise with felt cost ("A small portion of the weight lifted"); structure coherent with clear causality and orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting of tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower constrains choices and charges final image; sensory details selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "obsidian vanishing beneath foam like grief made visible."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of balance escalate through accumulative rituals; agency in winding and carving leads to shift with cost on-page during the reverie, tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through actions and images; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant answer via "balance accumulated through small ones."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm supports pressure without head-hopping, e.g., "calcified prayer" and "penance made wood" reflect Maren's grief-informed observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical density without loops; figurative language consistent and advances character, e.g., "like grief made visible"; peak beats clear with varied syntax and high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guilt and atonement through specific setting and objects; risk in literary style pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight with heightened stakes.</comment>
