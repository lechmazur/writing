<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority via the puppet head and embodied emotion. The final choice to sing the lullaby is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in "the end of everything made slightly more bearable" and the puppet head as offering. Orientation is anchored early, and the pane of hush constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the lighthouse and pane of hush constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "air tastes like endings") are filtered through Mira's POV, integrating atmosphere with character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting with Celeste) escalates through Mira's agency from adjustment to transmission, deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the clock's shift and the offering, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tenderness over salvation emerges through specifics (puppet head, lullaby) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of the song persisting in every atom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "nested patterns") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure, though slight ornamentation holds back a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of doomsday clock and personal grief, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
