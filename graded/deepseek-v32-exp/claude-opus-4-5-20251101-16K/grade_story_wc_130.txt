<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to embrace uncertainty is earned by prior attempts and carries visible cost in the reframed uncertainty. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the epiphany edges toward diagnostic language, it remains anchored in the ritual's concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the final lines: "something she'd chosen rather than something inflicted." Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of imagery tightens to a decisive conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and its objects (glass eyes, mosaic) are indispensable, charging the final image and constraining the ritual. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perceptual bias toward patterns and geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Internal conflict escalates through the ritual to a realization that reweights the dominant stake; the cost of accepting not-knowing is unmistakable on the page. Agency drives the escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss emerges organically from particulars; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One line articulates the thesis somewhat directly, but it is dramatized by the pattern rearrangement and not merely asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mira's contemplative, mathematically-inclined mind. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, dense prose without loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical emotion and fantastical setting feels inevitable; the central metaphor of grief as an unsolvable equation is transformed through specific, grounded details and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
