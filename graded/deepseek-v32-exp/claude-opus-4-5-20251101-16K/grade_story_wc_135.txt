<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. Her final shift from restoration to navigation is earned, though some interior conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, and the accumulative lens holds firmly. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: the final image of rain washing the harbor stone while Mira reflects on reading absences reconfigures the story's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the harbor and rain charging the final image. The trumpet valve functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice and resonates at closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring truth and healing) escalate accumulatively through Mira's agency. The cost is legible in the community's reactions and her realization that restoration is impossible; the final image reweights options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the meaning in absence, the resilience of truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of traces and witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical voice filtered through Mira's perception. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and perceptual signature are controlled and consistent, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; rhythm accelerates and breathes with the scene, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of an ocean-spray archivist with reactive vision is fresh and fully integrated. The synthesis of magical realism and historical recovery feels inevitable, and the lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
