<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is clear and intensifies through the shards, culminating in the earned choice to leap. Interiority is concrete and embodied in actions like kneeling beside her dead self. The final shift from conquest to acceptance is rooted in prior causality. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("labyrinth of self") nearing diagnostic label-speak, but it remains integrated into the speculative concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Mosaic structure (Track B) with four shards is taught early, transitions are legible via the tablet. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: Mira's leap and transformation reweight the premise from seeking to acceptance, with cost legible in the tablet dissolving and her becoming "complete." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The viaduct is a vivid, charged micro-setting that constrains choice (the tablet works only there) and directly pressures the climax. Sensory details like "rainwater pooling" and "glowing faintly" are selective and purposeful. The environment crucially shapes the final image of the empty viaduct, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquering the self-labyrinth) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a meaningful deepening: each procedural shard reweights Mira's understanding, narrowing her options to the final, cost-paying leap. Agency is clear, and the cost (dissolution of the tablet, surrender of eternal cycling) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance over conquest emerges organically through the shard structure and Mira's accumulating realizations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of her falling upward to become "complete." Avoids moralizing; subtext is carried by the recurring drop/ripple motif and the tablet's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice is consistent and modulates with pressure, from observational ("The viaduct hummed") to transcendent ("falling upward"). The mosaic elision and compression are taught and legible. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and supports the tone. No evident loops, scaffolding, or register drift. A single minor strain ("darkening brightness" is slightly abstract) prevents a 9+ but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of procedural generation, fractured timelines, and a personal metaphysical labyrinth. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, lived details (clay tablet, viaduct, drop/ripple). The structural risk of mosaic shards heightens stakes and coheres, leading to a fresh, inevitable-feeling closure.</comment>
