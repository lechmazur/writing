<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "grief struck... luminous, tormenting"). The final endurance—climbing higher while sinking deeper—is earned by prior causality, showing cost through her trembling hands and aching knees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing of ascending/descending tied to grief; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Cost is legible on-page in "the luminous torment was hers alone" and her continued climb, foreclosing peace for memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choice via the floating isle's logic (ascending/descending) and charging the final image with the basilica and garden. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are emotional (preserving Lia's dreams); escalation occurs through accumulative actions (polishing, lighting, folding) that deepen cost. Mira's agency in endurance drives pressure under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in her physical and emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (cranes, dream-light); ending reweights grief and memory without moralizing. Subtext is rich in implication, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, with controlled rhythm; single POV is stable and perceptual signature strong through Mira's biased noticing. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., dream archives) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats ("beauty and anguish inseparable as the shadow from the basilica").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (dream recording, floating isle, origami cranes) feels inevitable; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes—specifics are irreplaceable.</comment>
