<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in contradictory impulses—preservation as both duty and poison—embodied in micro-choices like using the cracked tube. Her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her weeping, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "she wept—not from sadness exactly, but from the foxglove beauty." Orientation is anchored early, and the fading orchids provide a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (opal library, glass orchids) and key object (cracked bamboo tube) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, with no generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) escalates under the Accumulative lens through increasing density as orchids fade. Protagonist agency drives each revival, with cost unmistakable in the "foxglove regret" and weeping, though escalation is subtle but sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through concrete particulars—glass orchids, extinct feelings, the cracked tube—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elara's acceptance, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., time "moved differently") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("foxglove regret") is consistent and voice-motivated. Information density is high, and sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass orchids, extinct feelings, and memory preservation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
