<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's calm, observant nature is consistently embodied and drives her archival work, but internal conflict is minimal, and her motivation, while clear, lacks intensification under pressure, fitting Earned Stasis without contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; mosaic shards build pattern toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the final photograph matching past arcs reweights pain into art with cost legible in the raised hands and lavender field.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusted factory are vividly specific, filtering through Mira's POV; the setting charges the final image as a sanctuary born from industrial bones, constraining the story's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stake of collective healing escalates via density of photographic arcs and town recognitions; Mira's agency drives deepening, cost felt in final symmetry, though pressure is gentle without antagonistic conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pain transformed into connection emerges through arcs and gestures without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via the photograph pairing that reweights survival as art.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature matching Mira's observational calm; voice is lyrical, stable, and pattern-taught, no head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegantly dense with varied syntax and clear propulsion; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines do multiple jobs, and closure image is sharp without artifact obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival arcs and collective healing feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details anchor originality.</comment>
