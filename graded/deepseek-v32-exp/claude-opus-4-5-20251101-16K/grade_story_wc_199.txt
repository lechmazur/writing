<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Venn’s orderly nature and transformative revelation are concretely embodied through specific actions (sorting seeds, building monuments). Her final decision to plant rather than preserve arises from earned causality—the moonstone-speck leaf’s message—with visible cost: letting go of her old self. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are tactile (tears in ash).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building pattern and pressure until the moonstone-speck discovery triggers a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost: “build monuments to her old self” and the decision to plant seeds. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (floating arbor, ashen sky) is vivid, selective, and pressures choice: the arbor is dying from “too much preservation,” which directly informs Venn’s climactic shift. Micro-setting (platform, leaf, monument) constrains action and charges the final image of planting seeds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arbor’s survival vs. orderly preservation) escalates through the moonstone-speck revelation, which reweights stakes under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Venn’s decision to plant seeds forecloses her old path with felt cost—releasing the self who hoarded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal vs. preservation emerges organically from concrete actions and images. The leaf’s message, though explicit, is earned by prior particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of planting seeds and imagining green shoots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually selective voice that reflects Venn’s worldview. Diction and syntax are controlled, modulating with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice coherence supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variety. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting (“the hush where past meets prophecy”) is pattern-taught and voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis: floating arbor, leaf-reading folklore, monuments to lost things. The premise feels fresh through grounded detail and character-specific choices. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
