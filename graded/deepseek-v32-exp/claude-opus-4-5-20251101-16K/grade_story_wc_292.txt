<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with "spongey feeling"; her final choice to appeal is earned by decoding journals, with cost felt in dread and risk. Minor tell in internal conflict, but embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost as she composes her appeal; orientation anchors early; persistent constraint of the sea bringing evidence shapes tactics. No causality breaks, and closure lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vivid and pressures choices (weather station, instruments); copper nail as object constrains choice and charges final image; sensory details selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to systemic confrontation; agency driven by discoveries; cost unmistakable in dread and confrontation risk. One meaningful tightening when she decodes the stanza and connects it to the nail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited shame vs. courage emerges from particulars like journals and nail; ending offers resonant non-literal answer through Vera's maps; subtext in sea and evidence, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice lyrical and matches Mira's perspective; no head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure. No dialogue, but internal voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language controlled (e.g., "spongey feeling"); sentences advance story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate change, reversible exile, and encoded maps; specific details like copper nail and coded stanzas; emotional truth in family legacy; risk-taking in quiet, charged closure.</comment>
