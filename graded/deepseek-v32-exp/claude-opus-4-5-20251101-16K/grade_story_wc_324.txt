<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity and empathy, driving her to shield the signal without calculation. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices under pressure, but a slight telliness in labeling "incidental heroism" slightly limits the score. The final choice to protect the connection is earned and costs her trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mira's actions trigger the connection and interference, leading to a decisive change with felt cost (daughter's peace, Mira's trembling). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration of Mira's role, anchored by the hearing aid. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the hearing aid are not just atmospheric; they constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional focus. The setting actively pressures the window of connection and shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: the predatory signal forces her to shield it, raising stakes and costing her disorientation. The dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) tightens meaningfully, and the cost is unmistakable in her trembling and the daughter's transformed grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the hearing aid, the static, the whispered assurances—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about listening and protection. A minor slip: the explicit label "incidental heroism" slightly interrupts the subtext, but the thematic resonance remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, hushed perceptual signature that matches the tone. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; rhythm and diction control under pressure heighten the climax without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with varied sentence rhythms that propel the scene. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Information density is high; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. The final image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, specific synthesis that transforms the familiar trope of communicating with the dead. The hearing aid as a tool and the predatory interference add originality. Risk-taking in the quiet, atmospheric approach pays off with emotional truth and inevitability.</comment>
