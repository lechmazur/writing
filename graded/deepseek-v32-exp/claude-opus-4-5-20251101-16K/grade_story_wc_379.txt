<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and consistent; her micro-choice to place the key embodies her values. However, her characterization leans toward steady wisdom without contradictory impulses under pressure, which limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with clear cost in the courtyard's loss and the mailed letters. Demolition notice tightens pressure, and the mosaic structure is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard and mailbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Maren's curator perspective, and evolve with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (solving the mystery before demolition) escalate with the notice, forcing a collective decision. Cost is legible in the loss of the courtyard, though agency is more communal than individually driven by Maren.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through witness emerges organically from particulars (letters, locket, listening). The final image of the key and photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice has a distinct, lyrical curator's texture. Perceptual signature is consistent, and dialogue (when present) is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("sandstorm calm") is purposeful and clear; syntax varies effectively with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of community mystery with themes of listening and loss feels inevitable. The thrift-store curator angle and locked mailbox metaphor are fresh and fully integrated, though not radically unconventional.</comment>
