<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is vivid and specific, with embodied emotion and clear motivation rooted in loss. Her micro-choice to approach the mother and child is earned, and the final moment of connection carries visible cost. However, the story lacks on-page contradictory impulses or internal conflict in scene, which limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise with Conceptual Repricing) that lands on the page with felt cost—the loss of sound against the discovery that "silence could sing." Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor and camera function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perception, and the luminous moonlight becomes integral to the closure's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence into music) is signaled early and escalates through Mira's agency—her decision to engage with the child. Under the accumulative lens, density increases and the stake is reweighted with a legible cost: her lost world versus the found connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and actions, avoiding statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the symphony "only the deaf could hear"—that reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complex joyful sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature shaped by Mira's deafness. The prose rhythm and diction are controlled, and any elision (e.g., the camera's lack of film) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic variety. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere with concision. The final paragraph lands with powerful, clear imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a deaf former music advisor mapping silence—is fresh and specific, synthesized into a coherent, risk-taking lyric mode. The transformation of silence into a bridge feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional authenticity elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
