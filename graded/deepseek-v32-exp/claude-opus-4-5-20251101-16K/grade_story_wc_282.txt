<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is consistent and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in personal loss and professional duty. The fossil serves as a concrete transitional object, and her endurance as a watcher carries subtle cost. However, internal contradictions are understated, and the emotional progression, while credible, lacks the layered irrationality needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens—Vera continues her work, with the warm fossil bridging past and future. Orientation is immediate, causality coheres through sensory discovery, and the cost of her solitary witness is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave network is vividly rendered through emotional heat maps and mineral phenomena, constraining the discovery and charging the final beat.

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fossil, the maps, and the floating figures, exploring memory, witness, and connection across time.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or artifacts that obscure closure. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative texture, and figurative language is precise and integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes speculative fiction with emotional archaeology in a fresh, non-obvious way. The "factually mystical" approach and the sensory mapping concept are fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
