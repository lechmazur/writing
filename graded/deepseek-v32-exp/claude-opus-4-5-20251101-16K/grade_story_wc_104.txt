<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied scars and a desire to rebuild, compelling high-stakes action. Interiority is concrete ("cradling it like something sacred," "trembling in her hands"), though internal contradiction is minimal, leaning toward steadfast resolve rather than complex flaw. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost (scars, urgency).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because the wall falls, she must hurry; therefore she secures the seeds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "the harder work: learning to grow." Orientation is immediate; the puzzle payoff is slightly convenient but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image through contrast (plastic prizes vs. seeds). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes, cracked skylights, yellowed keys). Spatial choreography is clear and integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (securing genetic future) is signaled early and tightens via the radio message, raising urgency. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens; cost is legible in her trembling and the weight of "ten thousand futures." One meaningful pressure point suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerging from ruin is woven through concrete particulars (scars, seeds, plastic trinkets). Subtext operates in image and implication, though the final line "learning to grow" verges on explicit moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without a stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perceptual signature (noticing dust, decay, iridescent feathers). Prose rhythm modulates with urgency. No head-hopping; elision (Vashti's backstory) is anchored and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid imagery and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Lines advance story and character simultaneously ("She was still a liberator, still marked by chains..."). Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-regime rebellion, a seed vault, and a carnival setting feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific lived detail (piano puzzle, arrow fletching). Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
