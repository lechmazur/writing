<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's curiosity and engineering mindset are concrete and drive the plot; her final choice is earned by prior discovery and study. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic labels ("quiet recognition," "puzzle out new equations for hope") that slightly abstract her emotional state, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with clear cost: Maya's proposal accepts limitation, and the final image of choosing "forward" reconfigures options. Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to decision. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the terminal's tangled systems shapes the entire arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice; the sextant piece charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional gaze. Setting is inseparable from the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the causal lens: from survey duty to a committed alternative proposal. Maya's agency drives the tightening, and the cost of accepting a limited revival is legible on the page. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—navigation through limitation, legacy, and realistic hope. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is woven through the sextant and Chen's design.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical observation and lyrical wonder. Prose rhythm is controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., the forty-hour study ellipsis) serves momentum. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: sentences are dense and propel the story, figurative language is precise, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final paragraph's cadence reinforces closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of an abandoned spaceport, engineering pragmatism, and a historical artifact feels fresh and inevitable. The story avoids cliché by focusing on realistic revival rather than grand salvation. Risk-taking in the quiet, hopeful resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
