<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is deeply rooted in specific, embodied grief (constellation tattoos, the amber). Her motivation to "hush the dissonance of old guilt" compels every action. The final choice to tether her guilt is earned by the preceding emotional revelation, with a visible cost in her tears and the dimming of her tattoos. A slight deduction because her agency in the lab is largely reactive (following letters, placing amber), though her final act of writing the note and releasing the guilt is decisive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): Vera's guilt is reconfigured and suspended, not erased, with clear cost ("constellation tattoos dimmer now"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through layered sounds and revelations to a final, reweighting image. The "NOT YOUR FAULT" message from the insect provides a decisive, conceptually priced shift that makes the before/after legible. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail ("haunted firmware," "spectral data") that directly pressures Vera and supplies the crucial resource for closure. The amber and the console are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is expertly filtered through Vera's emotional state, creating a cohesive, haunting atmosphere that is indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is superb. The dominant stake (Vera's need for absolution) deepens with each new translation (HUNGER, COLD, PAIN), reaching its peak with the insect's ancient message. The cost is unmistakable on the page in her tears and the physical act of binding her guilt. Agency is slightly passive in the middle beats (the system does the translating), but the climax and resolution are firmly driven by her choice to tether and release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the integration of concept and character. The core idea—that untranslatable sounds are not failures—is earned through the painful specificity of the baby's cries and the insect's message. The final, written note offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the juxtaposition of cosmic and personal silence ("meteor hush").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature ("space between heartbeats," "meteor hush"). POV is stable, deeply internal, and the prose rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional pressure, compressing in moments of high revelation. The elision of how the lab was found or built is purposeful and taught, focusing all attention on Vera's emotional journey. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic rhythm. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats: "the meteor hush of the laboratory wrapped around her—that cosmic silence that follows catastrophic passage, when everything simply waits" slightly explains a potent metaphor. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure but prevents a higher score. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept (haunted sound archive) with intimate human grief (misunderstood infant cries) is original and feels inevitable. The turn where the ancient insect offers absolution is a breathtaking, non-obvious inflection that transforms the premise. While the "magic guilt-solving machine" trope is present, it is wholly transformed by the specificity of the imagery, the emotional truth, and the conceptual cost paid at closure.</comment>
