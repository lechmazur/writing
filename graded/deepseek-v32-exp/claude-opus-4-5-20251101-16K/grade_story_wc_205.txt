<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her motivation—to restore the Carvers' humanity—is clear and rooted in loss. Her final choice (to begin again) is an Earned Stasis earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the "burnished sorrow" she carries. Slight deduction for moments where emotion is summarized poetically rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren resolves to continue her work, with cost legible in the final image of her sleeping "dreaming of the civilization she would give back." The storm and discovery sequence provides a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly rendered and functions as a micro-setting that pressures choice (the storm, the core tombs). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maren's expertise and grief. It charges the final image but does not maximally constrain tactics beyond the storm protocol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving the Carvers' spiritual depth) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Maren's agency—devising her approach and discovering the vessels—which deepens the conflict and reweights the stakes. The cost is her renewed, solitary struggle against the Council, felt but slightly muted as the external opposition remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through specific images (the shard, the funeral vessels, temporal light) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief encoded as art and memory as a form of resistance. Subtext is rich, and the integration of personal and archaeological loss feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, poetically-inclined narrative voice that filters the world through Maren's expertise and sorrow. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, supporting the accumulative texture. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: occasional register drift toward the abstractly poetic in peak beats (e.g., "burnished sorrow," "artists of grief") slightly softens immediacy. However, information density is high, and propulsion is maintained without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological dispute, visible time, and personal grief is fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through Maren's lived perspective. The risk of a quiet, reflective closure pays off with conceptual integrity and emotional specificity.</comment>
