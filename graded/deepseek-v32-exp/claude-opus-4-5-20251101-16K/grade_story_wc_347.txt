<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's reluctant caretaker role is embodied through concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. cost) act in scene, and the final endured stasis is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost ("tomorrow the orchard would demand its due"); the causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident through descent and return; the persistent constraint of the curse shapes tactics and the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice (labyrinth frost, mechanical birds); the small nut and blueprint constrain actions and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save travelers, avoid curse transmission) escalates under the causal lens via the live clock and Maren's precise agency; cost is unmistakable on the page in her forfeited warmth and the orchard's enduring claim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet sacrifice emerges organically through particulars (nut, blueprint, graceless beauty); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "peculiar hope" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; line-level propulsion supports closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed inheritance, mechanical patrols, and mathematical guidance feels organic; specific details (nut, blueprint) transform tropes; risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
