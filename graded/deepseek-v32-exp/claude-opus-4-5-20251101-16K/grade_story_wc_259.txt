<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meris's interior contradiction is embodied in the ritual's anguished joy, and her final transformation into a vessel of understanding is earned by her prior training and choice, with visible cost in her changed nature and separation from her order.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Meris emerges transformed) with felt cost ("Her order would not recognize her now"); orientation is immediate and the persistent constraint of unpredictability shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive constrains choice (requiring unpredictable movement) and charges the final image (pagoda reflecting dark, archive sealing); sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Meris's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge) escalates through the purification ritual, driven by Meris's agency; cost is unmistakable in her transformation and the foreclosed path of returning unchanged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (atoms of nostalgia, ritual sensations); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—knowledge as both illuminating and devastating—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct lyrical, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative build, and purposeful elision (e.g., the archive's exact mechanics) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the scene's emotional intensity, and no artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Core concept (atoms of nostalgia) is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the transformation of the knowledge-seeker trope feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
