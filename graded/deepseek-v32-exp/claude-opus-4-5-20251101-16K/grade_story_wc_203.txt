<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is consistently characterized with clear motivation and embodied emotion; his final choice to take the object is earned by his traits and the ghost's request, though he remains somewhat reactive, lacking strong internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkage; closure lands on-page with felt cost as "the weight... begin to lift," and his ghost-seeing ability shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details filter through Marcus's expertise; the setting constrains choice via ceiling panels and dust patterns, directly charging the final image of hidden secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover what ceilings hide) escalates through Marcus's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs when he retrieves the mainspring barrel, with cost legible in the weightless burden lifting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden guilt emerges through cracks and burden imagery; subtext operates in silence and implication, though the final line is slightly explicit, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct observational voice; prose reflects Marcus's professional perception and lexical choices, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Polished, rhythmic prose with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seeing technician and circus secrets; specific details and emotional truth avoid cliché, with risk-taking in blending supernatural and mundane that heightens stakes.</comment>
