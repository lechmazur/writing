<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's eccentricity and method are concrete, her motivation to investigate clear, and her final choice to keep the secret is earned with visible cost in solitude. Lacks strong contradictory impulses in scene, but interiority is embodied and decision forecloses a path. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is an Earned Stasis (keeping the secret) with felt cost on-page. Orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of her gift shapes tactics. All beats link via because/therefore to a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (opal dock, mist) and charges the final image; the lighthouse and drawer function as micro-settings that constrain discovery. Sensory detail reflects POV bias and integrates with action. No generic placeholder; environment mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the gesture) escalates through Maren's agency under causal lens; one meaningful tightening occurs at the drawer discovery. Cost is legible in her renunciation and burden. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love, memory, and solitude emerges through particulars (Edelweiss, borrowed memories) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via image and silence. Subtext operates in gaps and implication; earned wisdom from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable and apt; voice has distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "borrowed memories") is taught and paid off. Diction remains within character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled; sentences vary rhythmically with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. High information density without padding; read-aloud ear test passes effortlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and late romance feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (Edelweiss, opal dock) anchor universals; emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
