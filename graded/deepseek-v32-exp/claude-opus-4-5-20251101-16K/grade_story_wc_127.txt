<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's interior contradiction—professional detachment versus desire for empathy—is concretely embodied; her final choice to give real emotion is earned by prior absorption of fragments, with cost felt in the static-charged silence. Slight diagnostic label in "To fuse insight with empathy" is minor and does not undercut the earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Vera's methodical absorption leads inevitably to transformation and the transaction with Felix. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in "the weight of authentic feeling" and the amber grotto fading to darkness; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk constrains choice as Vera's workspace and charges the final image through honey-and-shadow atmosphere; sensory details like "vials of synthetic grief" are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vera's quest for authentic feeling—escalates via her agency in absorbing emotions, culminating in her refusal to sell a counterfeit. Cost is unmistakable in the final silence where "two people who had never felt anything real" confront the weight of genuine emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths versus full truth emerges from concrete events—Vera's replication process, her transformation—and resolves in a resonant, non-literal final image without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the blotter petal's glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic, detached voice modulates under pressure ("Real joy hurt. Real grief sang."). Dialogue is minimal but natural; elision in emotional sensing is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("between a cathedral and a crime scene") is precise and supports clarity. No artifacts obscure the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of a counterfeit emotion dealer is freshly synthesized through specific details like static electricity sensing and the amber grotto; turns feel inevitable, and risk-taking in the concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
