<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marek's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with his gift/curse and motivation driving the action. His final lighter state is earned by the subsumption, and micro-choices (going gloved, analyzing pools) reveal his values. The emotional contagion trait is set up but not activated in the climax, a minor missed opportunity that doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers memory and emotion toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marek returns changed. Closure lands with cost (pavilion destroyed, personal toll) and orientation is clear early. One meaningful tightening—the subsumption—drives the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the desert fortress and coral icebound pavilion constrain choice (rain exposes entrance, pools guide analysis) and charge the final image (pavilion gone, mercy lingers). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marek's chef POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smoothing memories) escalates under Accumulative lens through deepening engagement with remorse. Marek's agency (choosing to subsume) drives the turn, with legible cost in the pavilion's collapse and his emotional labor. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing through shared human experience emerges from concrete images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the meal seasoned with forgiveness, reweighting prior pain without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV (third-limited) is stable with a distinct lyrical, chef-filtered perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains consistent. No dialogue; compression and rhythm support pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, emotional contagion, and stored remorse into a fresh, organic whole. Specificity (chef, coral pavilion, tidal analysis) and emotional truth avoid cliché. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
