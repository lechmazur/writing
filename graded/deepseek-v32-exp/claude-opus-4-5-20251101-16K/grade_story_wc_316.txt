<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's ego death and emotional numbness are concretely embodied, driving her micro-choices; her contradictory impulses (to win vs. to feel) culminate in a earned renunciation of singular identity with visible cost as numbness recedes. Maya’s vibrant certainty provides a sharp complementary foil. Minor risk of diagnostic label-speak is offset by dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a decisive change (shared custody, cracking open of numbness) with felt cost on-page: "The numbness receded, just slightly." The brain-in-jar prop and temporal revisions reinforce causality without breaking it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating dojo and brain in a jar are vivid, selective, and charged through POV; the jar constrains the final image but the dojo is more atmospheric than tactical. Sensory details ("clouds flickered amber and violet") mirror internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody of identity) escalates via Kira's agency when she abandons rehearsed arguments, tightening options to a shared solution. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of original claim and the slight thaw of numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of identity as practice emerges through particulars (brain jar, clone, dojo) with resonant non-literal answer in the final handshake. Master Chen’s explicitness is slightly overt but character-apt; subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, distinguishing Kira’s numbness from Maya’s vivacity. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, high‑density, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("scattered like light through a prism") is coherent and voice‑motivated. Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates with the confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone custody, ego death, and mutable history feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific emotional logic (numbness vs. vivification). Risk‑taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
