<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her dreamless state; her interiority is concrete and her micro-choices (opening the door, asking the archive) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned, though internal conflict is minimal but appropriate for the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a Charged Poise ("midnight endured... possibilities multiplied") with felt cost of dreamlessness and frozen time. The pattern of shards (train, archive, dune) coheres and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and fully integrated; the glowing dune, chess clock, and archive constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (salt and pollen, blue-green blooms) are filtered through Mira's perception and support the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening: Mira's request to "show me who's still burning" intensifies the stake of cultivating sparks. Cost is legible in her dreamless state and the frozen clock. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope and potential emerges organically from images (archive, clock, sparks) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of multiplying possibilities, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, with a strong perceptual signature ("time was not a line but a garden"). No head-hopping; elision (wave functions) is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive; sentences vary rhythmically; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Information density high; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic and quantum concepts feels inevitable; the dreamless guard and divergent archive offer a fresh angle. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
