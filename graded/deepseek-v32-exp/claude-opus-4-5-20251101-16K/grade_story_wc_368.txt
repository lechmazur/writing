<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yuki's watchful nature and post-transplant sensitivity are concretely embodied; her decision to create shifting colors and carry stories forward is earned by the illumination beat and the cost of accepting transience. The final choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Yuki's realization reweights beauty as motion and borrowed time, with cost felt in her commitment to carry stories. Orientation is clear early; causality is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house and morpho wing function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Yuki's dye-master perception, directly enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding the heart's legacy) escalate through Yuki's agency in lifting the wing, leading to a decisive deepening. Under the accumulative lens, the density increase reweights the dominant stake with visible cost in her final resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and structural beauty emerges organically through the wing's iridescence, light patterns, and Yuki's craft. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and reflects Yuki's observational precision. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity is high, and the closure image is undimmed by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes heart transplant, dye mastery, and iridescent morphology with originality; the combination feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
