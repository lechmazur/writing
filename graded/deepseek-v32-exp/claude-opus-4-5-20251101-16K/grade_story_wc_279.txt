<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction between whimsy and terror is embodied in "lilac-colored" fear; her socially perceptive micro-choices under pressure earn the final stance shift to creative space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure via Charged Poise in the final sketching image reconfigures meaning with cost legible in "lilac unease" and the forfeiture of certainty for room to draw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto and sand mandala are micro-settings that constrain perception and charge the final image; sensory selection (damp stone, mist) reflects POV urgency and artist's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning in the unlearning—tightens through Mira's agency in placing the tile flake; escalation is a density increase under the accumulative lens, with cost in the acceptance of uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of emergent hush emerges through concrete particulars (tile, mandala, whispers); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "space to draw" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature (artist's pattern-noticing) and lyrical rhythm; voice modulates from unease to openness without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with figurative language ("mist hung like gauze") serving atmosphere; no loops or scaffold, and syntax breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of unlearning, emergent hush, and chalk artist feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
