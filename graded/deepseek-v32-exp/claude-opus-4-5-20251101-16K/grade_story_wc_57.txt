<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's patience and dedication are consistently shown through action and dialogue, with micro-choices like sitting to wait earning her acceptance. The fisherman's reticence and recognition add depth. However, internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Maren is welcomed into the weavers, the causal lens holds, and the final image of "lightning's memory and human memory" reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "golden dock... dusted with the season's first snow" create atmosphere, but the setting functions more as mood enhancer than a constraint on choice, preventing a 9+ score despite its poetic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency: her patient pursuit tightens when the fisherman tests her, leading to the decisive teaching moment. Cost is legible in the "ancient world being buried while she fought to preserve."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges organically through seeds, knots, and the fulgurite without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of "both forms of preservation against forgetting."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical yet controlled. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor convergence in voice prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "soft white silence" serves clarity and momentum. Peak beats maintain precision, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed collecting and knot-weaving feels fresh and inevitable, with the secret weavers concept transforming familiar preservation tropes through specific, grounded details.</comment>
