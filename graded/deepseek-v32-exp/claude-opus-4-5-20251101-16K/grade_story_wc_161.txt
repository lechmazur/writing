<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (preservation vs. hiding) are rendered in scene, and her final choice to trust is earned by prior causality—the meteorite and song prompt a micro-choice to sing, which reconfigures her stance with visible cost (breaking three years of silence). Interiority is concrete and embodied (throat tightens, muscles remember). The closure’s charged poise is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Marcus’s arrival (inciting incident) forces a choice, leading to her song and the offer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she begins to let her heart be found, with cost legible in the breaking of her silence. Orientation is clear within 120 words; structure is a single scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (attic, skylight, dust motes) actively constrains choice (she cannot run without abandoning pigeons) and charges the final image (dust motes’ choreography mirrors her internal reconfiguration). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ink, feather dust). The meteorite chip functions as a micro-setting object that reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. preservation) escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses to sing, then to engage. The cost (breaking her silence, risking exposure) is unmistakable on the page. One meaningful tightening (the song as a test) narrows options and leads to the offer. Coherence under the causal lens is flawless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation, trust, cyclical return) emerges through particulars (dust motes, meteorite, songs) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the image of the pigeon carrying a secret heart and her “slow, blooming work” reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the settled pigeons listening).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature (reading dust motes as music, noticing feather dust). Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“dust motes… like music”) is pattern-taught and pays off. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the song. No artifacts obscure causality or closure. High information density with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, organic synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, stolen songs, dust-mote mapping) that feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded character choices. Risk-taking (lyrical, almost magical realism in dust motes) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration is earned.</comment>
