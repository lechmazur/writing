<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her embodied anxiety and elation at the glade show contradictory impulses in scene. The final unbound state is earned by her prior choice to cut the clipping and heed the covenant, with visible cost in her terrifying freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (freedom, new maze) with felt cost on the page in the final paragraph's "terrifyingly alive." The persistent constraint of being root-bound shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (e.g., "cobalt glade," "dew-soaked grass"). The maze and topiary clipping function as micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image where the clipping sprouts roots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shared unconscious lost) signaled early. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: cutting the clipping, journey, ritual. Cost is legible in her exchanged state—prophecy lifted for terrifying freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection vs. isolation emerges through particulars (maze, scars, dreams). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of the rooted clipping and Mira walking away unbound, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional pressure ("anxious elation"). Purposeful compression (e.g., coven backstory) is anchored in present cues and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("visions tangled with the hedge maze like vines") is consistent and clear. High information density with propulsion through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, specific synthesis of root-bound seer and eclipsed covenant tropes through grounded character choices. Risk-taking in lyrical, concept-driven style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
