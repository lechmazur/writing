<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's meticulous nature and unsaid history create a coherent, embodied motive; her trembling certainty and final spoken truth are earned by prior causality with visible cost (tears freezing). No diagnostic label-speak; interior contradiction is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she speaks her father's name and hears his voice, completing a conversation with felt cost. Hybrid lens (accumulative dominant) holds; orientation is clear early; the punch as key shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (cracks as arrows, fortress of whispers) actively guides choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("starlit vault in mist" reflects her analytical artistry). Environment constrains action via the punch slot and fading cracks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearthing unspoken truths) escalates through Elara's agency—daring to follow, pressing the punch—with cost legible in her tears and completed conversation. Under the accumulative lens, density increases tighten pressure to a foreclosing choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (routes unmapped until walked) emerges through particulars—phantom punch, crystallized whispers—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via her spoken truth and the fortress's echo. Subtext operates in imagery and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (pattern-noticing, mapper's intuition); voice modulates from analytical to lyrical under pressure without head-hopping. Diction remains within her lexicon, and elision (cracks as arrows) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("stars witnessed through the vault of mist"); clarity and concision sustain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mapping and unspoken truths into a fresh, inevitable arc; risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (brass punch, crystallized whispers) are irreplaceable and organic to character and closure.</comment>
