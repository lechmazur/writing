<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover time's texture is concrete and conflicted; her final choice to stay and solve the maze is earned by prior causality with visible cost in fading photographs and accepted eternity. Interiority is embodied (e.g., falling through timeline), and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara walks the paths embracing possible eternity—with cost legible in "worse eternities than understanding." Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is early and clear; persistent constraint (hyperbolic geometry) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (living bridge garden) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (root-woven pathways, crumbling photographs). Environment directly pressures Elara's actions and integrates with theme through hyperbolic geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. safety) escalates through photographs and retrocognitive traps; Elara's agency drives deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in fading futures and her renunciation of escape. One meaningful tightening forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as texture emerges through particulars (photographs, geometry, halo fragment) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "worse eternities than understanding," reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature focused on geometry and time; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, e.g., "Time was not a river or a line. It was a texture..." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "photographs drifted down like dying butterflies"). No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hedge maze design, hyperbolic geometry, and time manipulation feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual and lyrical execution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, and transformation avoids template plots.</comment>
