<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene; her final acceptance is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the scattering of sand. Motivation intensifies under pressure, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; accumulative/textural lens holds, leading to a resonant reconfiguration where Elena realizes she is "her own element entire." Closure lands with felt cost in the offering of black sand, and the persistent constraint of her father's legacy shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not just vivid backdrop but active elements that constrain Elena's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the micro-setting integral to choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in identity conflict escalates under accumulative lens through density of reflection; Elena's agency in the ritual actions drives tightening. Cost is unmistakable in her acknowledgment that destruction and creation share heat but can be aimed differently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming legacy emerges from particulars like firefighting, burns, and the lagoon ritual; subtext operates in images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control; perceptual signature aligns with Elena's firefighter alertness and poetic reflection. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and clear imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without redundancy, and figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter feels inevitable through specific lived detail and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is transformed with a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
