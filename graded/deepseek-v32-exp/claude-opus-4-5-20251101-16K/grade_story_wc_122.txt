<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Helena's deafness and emotional numbness are concretely embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices; her final renunciation of chasing sound for embracing silence is earned by the backward-record epiphany with visible cost in tears and tightened chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing where silence becomes presence, landed on-page with cost in her tears and decision to teach differently; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cavern and phonograph function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Helena's bias, e.g., "felt its slow heartbeat" against bark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating numbness—escalates via accumulative density of silence filaments; Helena's agency in playing records triggers a deepening that reweights options with cost felt in emotional release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence emerges organically from backward songs and cavern imagery; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, e.g., "silence, she discovered, was not emptiness—it was presence, waiting."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, compressed prose reflects Helena's sensory world; no head-hopping; elision (e.g., deafness) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("gray tide drowning everything") is controlled and voice-motivated; clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, silence, and backward sound feels inevitable; risk-taking with conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity in details like broken needle and filament of hush avoids template plots.</comment>
