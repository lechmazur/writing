<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's guardedness and gift are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her final decision to unclench and plant the seed arises from contradictory impulses in scene (defense vs. healing) and is earned by the thawed confession's cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with decisive change (planting the seed) and visible cost (losing her last defense), and the vortex's rule—feeding on fear—persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard vortex actively pressures Mira's choice to unbend, and the flesh-eating seed as a recurring object charges the final image; environment constrains action, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. self-protection) escalate via causal agency: the vortex attacks when confession thaws, forcing Mira's unbending; cost is legible when she surrenders the seed, foreclosing her guarded path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (finding/returning, guard/heal) emerges through particulars like the seed and mirror; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting ("Returning was the rest") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; rhythm and diction control under pressure (e.g., "warlike serenity") remain consistent, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("armor forged from stillness") is coherent and avoids muddle, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic magic and internal healing; specific elements (frozen confession, expanding circles) feel organic and heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
