<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vesper's motivation is clear and rooted in her borrowed heartbeat, but interior contradiction is not deeply dramatized; her calm endurance is earned but lacks on-page micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; accumulative lens builds to a Conceptual Repricing closure where mirrors become windows, with cost legible in the inherited heartbeat and ongoing work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to the action; the prism parapet and spring terrace constrain Vesper's work and charge the final image with impossible colors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled through the hush before bells, tightening time pressure; escalation is accumulative, driven by Vesper's agency, with cost in her borrowed heartbeat and the weight of inherited purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of reflection and possibility; subtext in lullabies and heartbeat enriches a resonant, non-literal answer about choice and inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical, rhythmic prose that reflects Vesper's perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language supports mood without muddle, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specific details like coded lullabies and borrowed heartbeat; emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
