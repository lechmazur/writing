<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a thief is clear and intensifies with the revelation; interiority is concrete (trembling hands, disbelief) and her final shift from thief to guardian is earned by the mother's message. However, some emotions are told ("luminous disbelief") rather than fully embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira plans her next theft with a new purpose, cost legible in the weight of the warnings and her mother's fate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira's expertise; Emerald Station and the jar of moonbeams constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (jade tiles, cold jar) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to life-and-death warnings via the decoded portrait; Mira's agency in reinterpreting the paintings tightens options and forces a costly choice to become a guardian, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from light, transition, and destiny; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is woven through the recurring motif of captured light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is consistently lyrical; perceptual signature is distinct ("the station existed in that impossible threshold"). No head-hopping, though some abstraction slightly distances peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with strong rhythm and information density; minor overwriting ("dual assault") does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and fully committed; the synthesis of portrait theft, prophetic warnings, and moonbeam decoding feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
