<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is precise and embodied, with Maren's reticence and observation driving credible micro-choices. Her final decision to continue the chain is earned by seventeen years of observation and the concrete discovery of Thorvald's sea glass. The cost of her commitment—a lonely monthly return—is legible in the closing image. A slight lack of contradictory impulses in the climactic beat prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is cleanly accumulative, with observed patterns (stones, Thorvald's habits) converging at the keeper's death to trigger Maren's decisive reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant charged poise: her decision to continue the chain and the ghost-lamp image reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout and is paid off by the final, weighted image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functional; the lighthouse, stones, and sea glass are not just backdrop but constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional, observant POV. The haunted lantern room and the Fresnel lens become active participants in the closure, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the chain of human connection) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the lamp's failure and Thorvald's death. Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens—her choice to build the message and commit to returning. The cost (her ongoing, solitary vigil) is felt, though the pressure point is a single, decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, communication, and the ache of witnessing—emerges organically from the stone language and Maren's actions, without moralizing. The final image of the "ghost-lamp" and her decision offer a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication (the sea glass as a new word).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, deeply embedded in Maren's perceptual signature—reticent, warmly observant, lyrical under pressure. Voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; all elision (the stone language's rules) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is luminous, concise, and highly controlled, with varied syntax and potent imagery that advances story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's "fractured rainbows" and "luminous ache" achieve high information density and rhythmic propulsion without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—stones as anonymous letters, a keeper's death, a supply skipper continuing the chain—is a fresh, specific synthesis. Tropes (isolated lighthouse, haunted room) are transformed through grounded character choices and the poignant, earned reconfiguration of the stone language. The emotional specificity and commitment to the premise feel singular and inevitable.</comment>
