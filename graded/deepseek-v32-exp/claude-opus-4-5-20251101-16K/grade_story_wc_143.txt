<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deep and consistent; motivation rooted in backstory (father's hourglass) compels her vigil. Emotions are embodied, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost (the crater's loss). Contradictory impulses—melancholy and determination—act in scene, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single scene with clear orientation; accumulative lens holds. Closure is a charged poise: the crater remains whole for one more morning, cost felt in impending destruction. Persistent constraint of time (mining at dawn) shapes tactics, and closure lands with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and essential: moonlit summit and crater pressure choices (waiting for dawn) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, filtered through Elena's professional gaze. Environment constrains action and reweights stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the crater's memory) signaled early; escalation through her vigil as dawn approaches. Her agency in photographing and waiting leads to a final reconfiguration with cost. Under accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density increase and cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of time, memory, and witness emerge organically from concrete details (sand grain, chemical reactions, photographs). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext rich in silences and images. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elena's perception. No head-hopping; narrative distance stable. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm strong; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh narrative through unique details (crater inspector, photosensitive paper, hourglass sand). Quiet, reflective tone is a risk that pays off, but premise is not entirely non-obvious. Integration is organic, with specific lived detail.</comment>
