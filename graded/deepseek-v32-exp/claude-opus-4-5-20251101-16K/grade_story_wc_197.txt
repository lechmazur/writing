<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is consistent and revealed through resourceful micro-choices; her overlooked nature motivates her tactics and culminates in an earned self-realization. The final commitment to rebuild stems from prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with clear conceptual cost—the ongoing struggle against indifference. The hybrid lens (causal plot, accumulative texture) holds, and persistent constraints (puddle map, key) shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira’s perception and actively guides choice; the puddle reflections and auric lagoon are indispensable, charging the final image and constraining navigation with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth) is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s agency—using the puddle map, retrieving the cache, distributing drives. The cost of enduring resistance is legible in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus indifference emerges organically from concrete details; the final image of the lagoon as a mirror of truth offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains cohesive under pressure, and any elision (e.g., puddle-map mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language supports theme without muddling clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian resistance through specific, tactile elements (puddle maps, phone booth keys) feels inevitable; quiet emphasis on memory over violence offers a non-obvious angle with bold coherence.</comment>
