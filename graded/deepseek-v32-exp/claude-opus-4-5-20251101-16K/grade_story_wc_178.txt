<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's frugality and devotion are consistent traits that drive every on-page choice, culminating in her decision to encode her own observations—an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable. The final micro-choice is earned, though interior contradiction under peak stress is rendered as a clean epiphany rather than simultaneous warring impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira seals a covenant and commits to continuing the cycle. Cost is legible in her weeping and the final act of encoding. The celestial event's precise arrival is a mild convenience but does not break causality or the taught pattern of patient revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is a crucible: the Babylonian chamber and observation deck constrain discovery and witness. The tile functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's perceptual signature ("amber tears," "dust motes suspended like distant galaxies").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift—the decryption culminates in the equinox observation, reweighting the stake of connection. Mira's agency drives the tightening; cost is the emotional release and her lifelong frugality paid as entry to the covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted devotion emerges through concrete particulars (tile, schematics, lentil stew) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the cycle of knowledge transmission continues, reweighting prior imagery. No moralizing; the final image carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Mira's frugal, precise astronomy. Voice modulates from analytical to lyrical under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful elision (the nebula's specifics) is taught and pays off in the emotional beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high; sentences advance multiple layers. Minor artifact: a slight paraphrase loop near "Encrypted devotion. That was what she had uncovered..." but it does not obscure closure. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of ancient astronomy, encrypted mathematics, and a frugal protagonist feels fresh and inevitable. The quiet, contemplative risk heightens stakes through specificity rather than plot twists. The core concept is fully committed to and transforms its components.</comment>
