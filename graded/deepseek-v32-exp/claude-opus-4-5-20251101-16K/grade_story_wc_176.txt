<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt and redemption; interiority is concrete and embodied ("her technically gentle hands," "fingers trembled"). The final choice—to carry responsibility and cast new bells—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Slight deduction for a moment of over-articulation ("forgiveness, she had learned, was not forgetting") but overall strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "carrying something heavier than guilt: responsibility." Orientation is clear early; the pattern of absence/preservation is taught and pays off. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid, selective, and integral to the plot—the setting constrains choice (frozen rope, light refraction) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's urgency and reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the names) escalates through Mira's agency: reconfiguring the rope, using the card. Under the accumulative lens, a single meaningful tightening occurs as light activates sound, reweighing the stake. Cost is felt in her weeping and the weight of responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory and continuity emerges organically from concrete particulars (punched card, lost wax, rope). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight deduction for one explicit thematic statement ("forgiveness... was not forgetting") but it is anchored in character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mira's expertise and emotion. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm modulate effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear. Minor register drift in one phrase ("forgiveness... was not forgetting") but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (punched card, ice sanctum, lost wax casting) feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of transcribed memory through absence is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet, ritualistic plot pays off.</comment>
