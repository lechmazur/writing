<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nadia's survivor guilt and hunt are embodied through concrete micro-choices (geode handling, typing resumption). Interior contradiction in "bleak exhilaration" acts in scene, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost in the indifferent sky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the final image of "ghosts of possibility" beneath an "indifferent sky." Orientation anchored early, and the geode as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystal are micro-settings that constrain choice (filtering readings) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Nadia's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens via density increase: pools grow (Lagos, Sudan, Yemen), reweighting the stake of hunting unused potential. Nadia's agency in continuing to type carries felt cost of her relentless pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unused potential and survivor's guilt emerges from particulars (geode, quantum pools). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of swirling "ghosts of possibility," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and poetic lyricism. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (circuit breaker countdown) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like frozen screams") is character-consistent and does not obscure clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physics and grief creates an inevitable, specific premise. Risk-taking in lyric-scientific blend heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure recharges prior material.</comment>
