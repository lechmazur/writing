<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her career; interiority is concrete through actions like smiling and writing down warnings. The final choice to accept the protective lie is earned by her discovery and Elka's revelation, with visible cost in her packed evidence and departure. Contradictory impulses—truth-seeking versus pragmatic acceptance—act in scene, and the closure is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Vera understands truth as a tool, with cost legible in her decision to leave the orchard's secret intact. Causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages from investigation to confrontation. Orientation is anchored early; structure uses two shards with a legible transition, and the persistent constraint of the stillpoint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like dust storms and the orchard's edge filtering through Vera's POV. The environment constrains choices—the stillpoint and diamond charge the final image, and micro-setting elements like shredded documents are integrated into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus protection—is signaled early and tightens through Vera's agency-driven investigation and confrontation. Escalation is causal, narrowing options as she discovers the cover-up and faces Elka's pragmatism. Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of exposure, foreclosing a path with felt trade-offs under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: truth, corporate greed, and protective lies are explored through Vera's arc and Elka's stance. Subtext operates in dialogue and gesture, like Elka touching the diamond. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the flawed diamond symbolizing reweighted meaning, avoiding moralizing despite a slightly explicit realization line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with Vera's sharply observant voice distinct in perception and diction. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Elka's warnings. Prose has controlled rhythm and psychic distance; no head-hopping or register drift, and elision in documents reconstruction is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic variety; sentences advance story without scaffolding or loops. No overwriting, mixed metaphors, or artifact issues; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonance effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing corporate conspiracy, environmental ruin, and survivor pragmatism into a non-obvious whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the stillpoint and diamond's calibration grooves. Risk-taking in subverting the debunker narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
