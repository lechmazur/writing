<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is concretely embodied through her roles as museum guide and baker, with interior contradictions (rosewater dread) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final acceptance of Tomasz's death and adoption of his daughter as a successor is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The only minor slip is a slightly explicit statement of motivation ("to rescue dying arts"), but it is anchored in dramatized actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of dread and bread rising. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pattern through shards (watching, baking, teaching) that cohere. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the arrival of Tomasz's daughter provides a meaningful tightening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto city, waterfall thaw, and recurring objects (opera glass, bread) are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mira's POV, creating a cohesive atmosphere of memory and peril. The setting actively pressures tactics (thaw exposes, waterfall conceals) and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultural survival) is signaled early and escalates through Mira's agency: the thaw increases exposure, Tomasz's absence raises dread, and his daughter's arrival forces a commitment to continuity. Under the accumulative lens, density increases and pattern breaks reweight the stake. Cost is unmistakable on the page in the loss of Tomasz and the persistent dread balanced by hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (bread as consumed memory, lens as seeing the past) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to exile and preservation through the image of bread rising alongside dread. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, and the story embraces complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and deep, with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature ("rosewater dread," "tears the city itself was weeping"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled, and elision (e.g., Tomasz's death off-page) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic variety; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught ("rosewater dread" recurs with charged meaning). Closure image is clear and unburdened by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of displaced persons preserving culture is made fresh through specific, grounded details (bread shaped like initials, emerald lens). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking (lyric accumulation, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story avoids template plots and offers a singular artistic stance.</comment>
