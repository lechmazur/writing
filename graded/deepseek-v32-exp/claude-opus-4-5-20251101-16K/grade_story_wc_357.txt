<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but her internal contradiction is underdeveloped—she experiences no conflicting impulses on the page. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (resilience as a practice, not a place) with felt cost in the responsibility she accepts. Causal lens holds strongly, orientation is immediate. Slight deduction for the echo revelation feeling slightly convenient, but it does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and integral; the inverted gravity, arches, and water flow constrain navigation and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully filtered through Kira's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (saving the orchards) are clear and escalate through Kira's agency—venturing into inversion, deciphering echoes. The climax is a decisive choice with a conceptual cost (undertaking a monumental restoration). Tightening is meaningful, though the pressure feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as cyclical practice emerges organically from the arrow tip and echoes, avoiding moralizing. The final image (returning with "memory itself") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is rich in the ritual description and the silent, charged environment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and vivid, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature. The "whirling silence" motif and navigational diction are consistent. No head-hopping; voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense, with vivid imagery ("green chandeliers," "ribbons of silver"). No noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, though a few phrases verge on decorative ("gentle upheaval").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity inversion, ecological ritual, and acoustic echoes feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, lived-in details (navigating by water flow, the arrow tip's fading power). Risk-taking in worldbuilding heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
