<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity is clear and motivates her investigation and decisive action, but there is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse shown, and the cost of her choice is not felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal linkage is tight and closure is a decisive change, but the emotional or conceptual cost of leaving the stranded luminance is underplayed, weakening the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stranded luminance and airship are integral, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposefully filtered through Elara's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Elara's agency, but the tension lacks a sharp, felt cost or a significant narrowing of options beyond the initial premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sociable isolation emerges organically through patterns and discovery; the ending resonates without moralizing, though the final line is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and matched to Elara's cartographer mindset; no head-hopping and perceptual signature is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied syntax; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (stranded luminance, hopscotch cipher, starlings) feels fresh and inevitable; the premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
