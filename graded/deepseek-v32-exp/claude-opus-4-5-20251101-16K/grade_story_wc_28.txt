<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and specific; Vera's contradictory identity ("gentle radical," "aberrant mercy") is embodied in micro-choices like saving a child who condemned her. Her retrocognitive trap and mechanical arm are flaw-driven constraints that shape her actions. The final endurance (giving her lifetime to the work) is an Earned Stasis with visible cost. A slight deduction for minor summary in her backstory ("had been a librarian once..."), which, while anchored, slightly distances immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through resonant imagery to a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Closure lands on the page with cost: "The work would take lifetimes. She would give it all of hers." The final image of her walking on, steel arm glinting, reconfigures the premise of memory as infrastructure with undeniable conceptual cost. The lens holds perfectly from the shattered sky motif to the warmth/cold distinction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring choice and charging the final image. The "shattered sky" and "ash-stained stones" are not just backdrop but reflect the internal state and stakes. The mosaic stepping stone and the tessera function as micro-settings that constrain action (triggering visions) and are essential to the closure. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Vera's retrocognitive perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring identity/meaning vs. oblivion) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a decisive deepening: the vision of Safiya reweights Vera's mission from personal act to transhistorical covenant. Agency is clear (she chooses to touch the tessera and to continue). Cost is legible in the tearful return to the broken present and the commitment of a lifetime. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and powerfully executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: memory as infrastructure, mercy as aberration, warmth vs. heat. The core concept ("aberrant mercy") is fully integrated into character choice and plot. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and the line "mercy took its aberrant forms." Avoids moralizing; the ambiguity of restoration in a broken world lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("retrocognitively trapped," "history beneath her heels"). Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional beats. The prose has a controlled, poetic rhythm that supports the accumulative drive. No head-hopping. Minor deduction for a single register drift ("aberrant mercy" edges toward thematic statement, though it is character-anchored).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and largely propelled. However, minor artifacts appear: some near-synonym loops ("broken, yes - ash-stained...scorched"; "shattered...rent...jagged cracks") and a slightly scaffolded phrase ("dangerous in her softness, revolutionary in her refusal..."). These do not obscure closure but create slight texture repetition. The final paragraph's rhythm is impeccable, securing a strong score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high: a fresh, specific synthesis of post-apocalyptic recovery, psychic ability, and archival ethics. The "gentle radical" and "retrocognitive" concepts are transformed through grounded, tactile detail (the tessera, the mechanical arm). The core premise is committed to fully, and the emotional truth—insisting on names in ashes—feels earned and inevitable, not derivative. Risk-taking in lyric, accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
