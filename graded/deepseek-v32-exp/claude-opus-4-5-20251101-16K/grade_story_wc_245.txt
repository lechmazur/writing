<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is precise and embodied; Sera's contradictory motives (mapmaking vs. grief) are shown in scene, and her final choice to map the melody is earned by seventeen years of searching, with visible cost in the emotional release and the act of sharing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where Sera's discovery of her daughter's transcendence reweights her grief, with cost legible in the weeping and mapping. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her gift shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the ultrasonic forest and Sera's touch-based perception constrain navigation, and the stillpoint's silence charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her blindness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closure for grief) escalates via accumulative density of musical notes and forest messages; Sera's agency in following them leads to a tightening that forecloses her search with a felt cost in the emotional blaze and the decision to share the map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—mapping emotional geography—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the melody map, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is rich in the forest's remembered fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct: lyrical, sensory, filtered through Sera's blindness and gift. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences vary rhythmically. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The closure image is sharp, and line-level craft supports the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapmaking, supernatural perception, and grief feels inevitable; the concept of a stillpoint and melody as emotional compass is fresh and fully committed. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
