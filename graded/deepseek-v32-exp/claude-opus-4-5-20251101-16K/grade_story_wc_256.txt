<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction (skepticism vs. longing) is embodied in concrete micro‑choices; her final realization and altered ringing are earned by prior causality with visible cost (weeping, transformed perception).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) where Vera’s understanding of connection shifts, with cost legible in her weeping and the final image of bells carrying the ghost song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the Laboratory constrains choice (the lens) and the recurring golden shadows charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Vera’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (authentic connection) tighten through Vera’s active questioning and use of the lens; the turn—hearing the child’s voice—reweights her goal with palpable cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Vera’s struggle; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the image of bells carrying a ghost song, avoiding moralizing while deepening the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and filtered through Vera’s perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction are controlled, heightening pressure without head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere with strong rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming familiar tropes through grounded details; the synthesis of bell‑ringer, lost sounds, and miner’s lens feels inevitable, and the quiet risk of the ending pays off.</comment>
