<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's ambition and sensory gift are clear, consistent drivers; her internal shift from "wildfire" ambition to "patient, breathing center" is earned through the village's lesson and her journalizing. The final choice (enduring the stench) is a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor deduction: the ambition-to-serenity arc, while effective, feels slightly programmatic, lacking deeper contradictory impulses mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Earned Stasis (Mira's stillness beside the blooming flower) with clear, felt cost (enduring overwhelming stench). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and thematic density. One flaw: the elder's gift of the seed, while thematically fitting, carries a slight convenience, slightly softening causal rigor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village is indispensable, not just setting but the crucible that teaches the core lesson ("cultivate serenity within motion"). The swaying bridges actively pressure Mira's understanding and charge the final image of stillness. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Mira's olfactory POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes successfully escalate from acquiring a physical object (seed) to mastering an internal state (serenity). The cost is legible in the final beat. Under the Accumulative lens, this is a meaningful deepening. However, the middle pressure (the conversation with Thessaly) is more thematic discussion than active, tightening conflict, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration. Theme (wisdom in overlooked spaces, serenity within motion) emerges entirely through concrete particulars: the journal on wrapping paper, the village bridges, the seed's decay/transformation. The final image is a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting prior material without moralizing. A hairline slip: the phrase "undercurrent of wisdom" is slightly on-the-nose in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Mira's sensory perception. POV is stable and deep. The journalizing device is seamlessly woven into the narrative stance. Minor restraint: the prose's consistent lyricism occasionally borders on a uniform texture, with minimal syntactic compression under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and controlled, with high information density. However, minor artifacts prevent a top score: a few slightly academic phrases ("olfactorily gifted"), and mild paraphrase loops ("stillness," "serenity," "motion"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the line-level sparkle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of elements (corpse flower, treetop village, olfactory gift, journal on wrapping paper) is fresh and specific, transforming the familiar "student seeks wisdom" trope. Execution is organic. It lacks, however, a truly non-obvious or risk-taking structural or conceptual inflection that would mark it as singularly ingenious.</comment>
