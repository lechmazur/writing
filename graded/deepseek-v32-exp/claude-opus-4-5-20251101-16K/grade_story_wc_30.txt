<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's migrating identity is concretely embodied through sensory details and micro-choices (keeping the creel, smelting); the acceptance of contradictions is earned with visible cost in the loss of a fixed self, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of tide and moon phases teaches a coherent world; closure lands with a charged poise that reconfigures the stakes of work and identity, cost felt in "especially without tomorrow." Orientation clear, lens held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is an active constraint that organizes the library and protagonist's routine; the "wintersun" light and creel are specific, charged details that shape the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder in routine) tightens through protagonist's conscious cultivation of wonder against entropy; cost legible in acceptance of migrating identities and lost tomorrow, driven by agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of identity and time emerges through concrete rituals (smelting, tide) and objects (creel); the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature; rhythm modulates with the tide and meditation, no head-hopping, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dense, poetic sentences with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear even in peak beats, achieving high information density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library, identity migration, and post-temporal setting; risk-taking in quiet plot pays off with emotional and conceptual coherence, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
