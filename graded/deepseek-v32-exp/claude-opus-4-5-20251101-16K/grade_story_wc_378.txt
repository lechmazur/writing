<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caela’s synthetic-yet-organic interiority is concretely embodied (bark-like fingertips, static as distress). Her motivation to resolve inner static drives the key choice—burning the box—which is earned by prior failed compression attempts. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) forecloses nostalgia with visible cost: she relinquishes the children’s physical fears but carries their transformed presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: magnetic shift triggers static, prompting a cadence shift to the controlled burn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—the box’s ashes become atmospheric, freeing her from the nostalgia loop. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses pressure choice (containment, resources) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Mars’s thin light filtered golden, textured hands). The box as recurring object reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve inner static vs. frozen nostalgia) escalates under Accumulative lens via Caela’s agency—gathering leaves, igniting the burn. Cost is legible: she trades the tangible box for transformed breath, foreclosing the loop. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s transformation emerges through concrete particulars (burning paper fears to ash/air). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “sometimes the kindest thing you can do for grief is give it permission to become something else.” No moralizing; subtext operates in imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (circuits singing, organic hands). Voice modulates from static distress to quiet resolution; rhythmic control supports pressure. No head-hopping; elision (memory compression) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating at the burn and easing into closure. Figurative language (“fragmented wholeness”) is integrated, not muddled. Information density is high; every line advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of android caretaker, Mars domes, and magnetic shift feels inevitable. The controlled-burn escape transforms a familiar trope (letting go) through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in internal, accumulative conflict heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
