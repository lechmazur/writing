<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal her devotion. The final transformation from grief to gratitude is earned through her actions, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost on-page. Orientation is early and clear; the grandmother's mystery and cathedral window act as persistent constraints that shape the revelation and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Elara's POV; the cathedral window constrains choice and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with a visible cost in her emotional journey that charges the final mural. One meaningful tightening occurs at the window revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Slight thematic echo in the final paragraph ("Because darkness is not absence...") moderates the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No dialogue; elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, supporting the accumulative texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mural art, familial mystery, and theological imagery feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
