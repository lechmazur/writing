<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied through the worry stone and chess metaphors; her endurance as exile is earned with visible cost, though the reflective mode slightly distances immediate contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with Charged Poise (peace amid exile) and felt cost ("melancholy and hopeful"); orientation clear early; nexus constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (magnetic nexus, twilight) and object (worry stone) actively constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. covenant) tightens through reflective deepening; agency in endurance forecloses paths with cost, though escalation is more cadence shift than causal turn under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in difficulty, sacrifice) emerges organically through chess motifs and silence; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (thoughtfully precise, chess-analytical); voice is consistent and lyrical, pattern-taught without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language (chess, navigation) is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exile, covenant, and chess transforms tropes through specific detail; risk in reflective structure pays off with coherence and emotional truth.</comment>
