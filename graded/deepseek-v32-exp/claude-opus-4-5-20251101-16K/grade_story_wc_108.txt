<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (fear vs. action) is embodied under pressure; her final choice to escape is earned by adaptive trait and prior causality, with cost visible in trembling certainty and abandoned cage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (escape) with cost legible in "terrifyingly, belonged to her"; orientation anchored early, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (rusted library, stars) constrains choice via ladder and skylight, charging the final escape; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with objects (cast, seashell) integral to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Victor's arrival; Mara's agency in outwitting and climbing drives tightening under causal lens, with cost in leaving manipulation for fearful freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power) emerges through action and image; subtext in objects avoids moralizing, though "I feel everything..." is a slight earned echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (fear-colored observation); voice modulates with pressure, dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts, figurative language ("carrion birds") enhances without muddle, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phobia-ridden stunt double and identity theft; specific details (seashell half, cast) create organic originality, risk-taking in fear-as-strength heightens stakes.</comment>
