<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is concrete and survival-driven; interiority embodied in sensory details like "hair lift and fillings ache." Her discarding assumptions and final choice to wake towers are earned micro-choices under pressure, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation clear early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes signal, with cost legible in her laughter and commitment. Accumulative lens held throughout, with pattern break reweighting meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting of suspended city and tower constrains choice via equipment and arrays; sensory details like "moon pressed close" and "wind howling" are selective and charge the final image of waking towers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of finding beginnings in endings escalates through Mira's agency in tuning and discarding assumptions; cost is visible in use of star fragment and her decision to wake towers, redefining options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as signal and endings/beginnings as interconnected emerges from particulars like the star fragment and echoes; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing, subtext in "city was waiting."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice blends poetic and practical tones, consistent under pressure. No dialogue, but narrative control is tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "veils dropping from a widow's face" is coherent and advances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial signals and silence; specific details like Hollywood star fragment transform tropes. Risk-taking in tone pays off with closure, feeling inevitable.</comment>
