<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thessaly's scattered consciousness is a concrete, character-particular interiority that motivates her gathering role. Her final dissolution is an earned sacrifice with visible cost ("poured her scattered essence into the weaving"). Micro-choices under pressure (coaxing songs, initiating the final singing) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. A slight abstraction in her emotional state at the climax ("desperate care") prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through gathered songs to a decisive, on-page closure (Thessaly dissolves, light returns). Orientation is immediate and clear. The cost is legible in her dissolution and the mica window's blazing transformation. The persistent constraint of fading light shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and essential: the alchemical orchard greenhouse provides sanctuary and dying resources, while the mica window is the key object that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Thessaly's POV ("phosphorescent fruit trees," "breath misting"). The environment directly constrains choice and supplies the climax's mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (realm's survival) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the last tree dims, forcing Thessaly's call to collective song. The cost (Thessaly's dissolution) is unmistakable on the page and directly reweights the final image. The tightening forecloses her individual existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory, community, and sacrifice emerges organically from concrete events and the "woven dawns" concept. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: light returns through collective song and personal dissolution, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The final image of the glowing window carries the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture reflecting Thessaly's scattered consciousness ("existed in fragments"). Perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent, with syntax modulating from fragmented to flowing as the song builds. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and supports the atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. A minor tendency toward slightly elevated diction ("collective breath," "essence") in peak beats is voice-consistent and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept—gathering forgotten songs to weave physical light—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The scattered memory keeper trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
