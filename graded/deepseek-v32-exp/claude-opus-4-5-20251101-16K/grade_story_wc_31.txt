<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's solitude and hidden truth are concrete, his motivation rooted in a luminous vow. The final realization that the search itself is the answer is an earned Conceptual Repricing, shown through the jar discovery and his commitment to continue. Interiority is largely embodied, though the weeping moment risks mild diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern of light, water, and sound builds to a resonant Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page with cost (the reconfigured quest and the warm key tag). Orientation is immediate; structure (surface/dive/return) is legible and serves the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the pier, festival, and sunken library are vividly filtered through Elias's perception and directly constrain choice (the dive, the jars). The key tag and jars function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling the vow) escalates through discovery of the jars, a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear (he chooses to complete the thesis). Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of his lifelong search, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of search-as-answer emerges organically from concrete images (jars, lanterns, key). Subtext operates through implication (the vow, the library). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final commitment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical, reflective perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains consistent. No head-hopping; purposeful compression ("meteor hush") is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical with high information density, varied rhythm, and no noticeable loops or scaffold. A slight risk of overwriting in a few phrases ("particulate darkness") is voice-consistent and does not obscure clarity or touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lamplighter, sunken library, and captured sound feels fresh and inevitable. The central conceit (color of sound) is transformed through specific, grounded character choice. Risk-taking in quiet, internal epiphany pays off with coherence and heightened stakes.</comment>
