<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and contradictory (thief/prisoner/vendor, desire to understand vs. restraint of parole). Her final endurance (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: "Her parole required her to stand at the threshold of beginning and never step through." Emotions are embodied (touching cold bark, feeling the story tremble). Minor deduction: some interiority verges on poetic abstraction ("the careful cultivation of absence") but remains character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira accepts her role of waiting and tending, with cost legible in the final paragraph's restraint. Orientation is clear within 120 words (glass orchard library, Mira, opening day lull). Structure is a single continuous scene with integrated backstory that tilts present stance. The pattern is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. The glass orchard library is vividly specific and integrated into action (incising bark, measuring exhalations). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (crystal trees, cloud-leather ledger, bottled moonlight). Spatial choreography is coherent. The environment is the story's central mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increase: Mira's careful work, the customer's request, and the trembling story in the grove deepen the stake of her parole. The cost of her restraint is unmistakable on the page in the final beat. Agency is in her renunciation/endurance, which forecloses the path of transgression with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence as potential emerges organically from concrete particulars (vials of emptiness, measuring unspoken fears). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's charged poise. Subtext operates in image and implication ("counting what was missing, waiting for what might someday arrive"). No moralizing; theme is inextricable from character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable close third-person, filtered through Mira's professional and emotional lens. Voice has a distinct lyrical texture that matches the setting, with controlled modulation. Perceptual signature is strong (noticing narrative striations, quantifying absence). No head-hopping. The experimental description is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and clear. Figurative language is consistent and enhances meaning ("shadows taught the light how to whisper"). High information density with no scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs. Minor hairline slip: one potentially overripe metaphor ("the first word would fall out like a ripe fruit") but it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original synthesis of concepts (orchard of pre-narrative stories, clean slate vendor, glimmering parole). The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on storytelling and penance. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
