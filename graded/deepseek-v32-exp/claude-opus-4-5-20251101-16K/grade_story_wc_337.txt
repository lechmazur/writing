<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's brokenness is embodied in her trembling hands and lucid unrest; her motivation to mend the dead's masks is consistent and deepens through the unraveling. Sela serves as a catalyst with visible grief, but her interiority is slightly told. The final choice—Mira continuing her work—is earned by her past and the scene's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Mira's "lucid unrest" and the ongoing accumulation of silence. The net's unraveling drives a coherent before/after change for Sela's mother and the spirits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly specific and constrain action—the net and needle are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory details (bone-colored fibers, prismatic light) are filtered through Mira's perception and integrated into the unraveling beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing spirits) escalates through Mira's deliberate unraveling of knots, each release deepening the silence and cost. Agency is clear; the final image of Mira working onward reweights the stake with visible price in her enduring unrest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence emerges through concrete actions—unraveling knots, absorbing grief—without moralizing. Subtext in imagery (net, prisms) and the ending's "lucid unrest" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to healing inherited trauma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perception is filtered through her expertise and grief. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with the unraveling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Peak beats maintain clarity without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief-work through mask restoration and knot unraveling feels inevitable. Specific details (prism sanctuary, interlaced hush) transform familiar tropes with grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
