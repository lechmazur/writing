<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; her internal conflict between instinct and thought is embodied under pressure. The final choice to retrieve the vial is earned by prior causality, and the emotional cost of confronting her mother's bones is felt. A minor deduction for the slightly tell-y realization about the vial's function ("The vial didn't store memories—it found them..."), which edges toward diagnostic summary in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear, felt cost in the final image of the vial as "holding everything that mattered and nothing that could last." The causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages (oxygen gauge, discovery, decision). The persistent constraint of time shapes tactics and the final ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively constrains choice (oxygen limit, the chamber of vials). The underwater temple and the vial itself function as micro-settings that pressure and enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action. The "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" recur to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieve the memory before oxygen runs out) is signaled early and escalates via the ticking gauge and the discovery of the bones. Mira's agency—the choice to override instinct and take the vial—drives the tightening under the causal lens. The cost is legible in her confrontation with mortality and the bittersweet recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality versus presence emerges organically from the vial, the temple's purpose, and Mira's final realization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Not permanence. Presence.") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the mother's fate and the nature of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filters perception through Mira's urgency and longing. The prose has a distinct lyrical texture ("lonesome splendor," "gathered hush") that modulates with pressure without losing coherence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. Minor artifact: the repetition of "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" leans slightly decorative, but the pattern is taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold; information density is high, and the closure beat remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of an underwater treasure-hunt frame with a poignant dementia/memory core feels fresh and organic. The emotional specificity (a child's lullaby, a mother's bones) avoids generic templates. The risk of a lyrical, quiet climax is earned and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
