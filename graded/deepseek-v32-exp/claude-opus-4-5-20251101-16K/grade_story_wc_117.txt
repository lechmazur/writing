<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's adaptive patience is embodied and drives key choices, but her characterization lacks interior contradiction or flaw, leaning toward idealization. Marcus's breakthrough is earned by causality, with visible cost in the crack of a door, though his change is somewhat expected.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Marcus speaks and asks to return, a door cracked open. Causal lens holds tightly—Elena's planned outing, the eclipse, and the curl lead to the shift. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: Sage Ridge and the eclipse constrain choice (timing, location) and charge the final image with sensory specificity (crescent shadows, sage scent, corona). Environment is filtered through Elena's professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Marcus's healing) escalates through Elena's agency—choosing the ridge, playing kalimba, giving the curl—tightening as totality prompts his words. Cost is legible in the "cautious exuberance" and the patience required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through concrete events and images, with subtext in silence and the curl. The final paragraph states the theme explicitly, slightly reducing resonance, but the earned, non-literal answer remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elena, with a distinct lyrical, therapeutic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "cautious exuberance") and no head-hopping. Elision (the accident) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and effective (e.g., "tiny eclipses scattered like offerings"). Sentence-level propulsion matches scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of familiar elements (therapist, traumatized child) through the specific use of solar eclipse and baby hair curl. The perspective feels organic and inevitable, with emotional truth outweighing surface novelty.</comment>
