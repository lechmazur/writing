<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sirel's interior contradiction (substituting reality vs. yearning for home) is concretely embodied; her final choice to remember and teach is earned by the feather and stone, with visible cost in her weeping and the stone's illumination. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure are consistent and revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (she will remember and teach) with felt cost (tears, cracked-open talent). Causal lens holds tightly: feather → memory → reading stone → realization → decision. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the stone and feather are persistent constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (Hollow Peak's labyrinthine bookstore) is vividly specific and pressures choice via isolation and discovery. The lost language stone and feather function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Sirel's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoiding vs. confronting memory) is signaled early and tightens via the feather's specificity and Sirel's agency in reading the stone. Escalation is causal; cost is legible in her weeping and the stone's transformation, foreclosing her path of forgetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (home as a carried shape, memory's cost) emerges through concrete particulars (feather, stone, prayer) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of teaching and the mountain's groan, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent, with a perceptual signature shaped by Sirel's seer nature. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., the scholar's visit) is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("mercury-glass skin," "hidden thunder") is consistent and clear; sentences propel momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (memory, lost language) through a unique, fully realized concept (mercury-glass seer in a mountain bookstore). The transformation of buried talent into reclaimed sight feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
