<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's grief is a consistent, embodied motivation that compels her to stay and build; her final understanding is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the warmth of the bronze foot and the charged silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: Mira's choice to stay leads to her building a capacity that culminates in guiding her daughter home. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of listening to the silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The signal station is a vital constraint and resource; the bronze censer foot as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mira's grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (navigating loss) escalate through Mira's agency—building tools, taking calls, guiding Elena—with cost paid in emotional weight and the realization of building within grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of building within brokenness emerges through concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (peace in wreckage) that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; prose texture is lyrical yet precise, reflecting Mira's grief-sharpened perception. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with information; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports emotional beats, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief, radio technology, and reverse migration; concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific lived detail and emotional authenticity.</comment>
