<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (gift as weight) is concrete and embodied; her final renunciation is earned by prior causality (her history of giving) and carries visible cost (emptying her last possessions). The child applies immediate pressure, and Mara's micro-choices under stress reveal a consistent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (empty-handedness, saved village). Orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of her "orchestrating coincidences" shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (black sand beach, active volcano) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (warm sand, green-gold light). The environment directly pressures the climax and evolves causally with the eruption’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's burden vs. volcanic threat) escalates via the child's prophecy; protagonist agency (releasing the jars) drives the decisive turn under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of her last possessions and the village's deliverance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through concrete particulars (jars, lava, release); the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the child’s prophecy and the final image of the lone lightning bug.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara’s perceptual signature (noticing “texture of transformation”). Lyrical, rhythmic prose remains consistent under pressure; dialogue (child’s lines) is natural and goal‑driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high (e.g., “the universe seemed to move through her like breath through a hollow reed”). Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (philanthropist, volcano, lightning bugs) feels inevitable; risk‑taking in lyric, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non‑obvious moral calculus.</comment>
