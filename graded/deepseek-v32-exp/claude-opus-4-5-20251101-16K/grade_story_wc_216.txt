<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices (embedding messages) reveal values, and her shift from measurement to witnessing is earned with visible cost. However, the internal conflict remains subtle, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with legible cost in the final image reweighting timekeeping from measurement to witnessing. Orientation is early and clear; the pattern of messages and responses builds coherently to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo constrains choice (depleting temporal stores) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Vera's POV. The urn fragment and chronometers are integrated into action and thought, creating a lived-in, atmospheric setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through Vera's agency in embedding messages and receiving responses, deepening the stake of meaning and connection. The cost is legible in the final reconfiguration of timekeeping as witnessing, which forecloses her earlier path of mere measurement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (capsule, messages, network) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of time and connection, reweighting prior material through the final image of witnessing and care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, reflective voice that matches Vera's perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the accumulative pattern is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time, memory, and human connection in a post-temporal world feels organic and inevitable. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the perspective is memorable and specific.</comment>
