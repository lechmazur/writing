<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished is clear and rooted in her acoustic sensitivity and family legacy. Her interiority is concrete, and her final choice to unstring the violin is an earned, embodied renunciation with visible cost. The emotional progression from inadequacy to acceptance is credible. A slight abruptness in her realization ("Mira understood then why she had come") is a minor, non-closure flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence transforms into expectation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, and cost is legible in the unbinding and offering. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph. A minor causality softness exists in the quick pivot to understanding her purpose, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply woven into the POV's perception. The greenhouse and shipwrecks function as a micro-setting that directly constrains choice (wading, playing to the hulls) and charges the final image. The score is capped because Q2 is not ≥9.0, though the integration itself is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding meaning in silence) escalates cleanly under the accumulative lens through Mira's sequence of actions: playing, speaking, and finally unbinding the violin. Each step deepens the cost and tightens her renunciation. The escalation is driven by her agency, and the price of surrender is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges organically from the imagery and actions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the drifting bowl and unstrung violin reweights prior material. The score is capped due to the Q2 gate, not thematic weakness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's acoustic perception. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with syntax and rhythm modulating to match emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature is exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A few sentences in the reflective midsection verge on overwrought density but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes post-apocalyptic, musical, and meta-narrative elements into a fresh, organic whole. The core concept of the "chronic hush" is transformed through specific, lived detail and a bold, quiet climax. The risk-taking heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
