<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Guardian's interiority is concrete and embodied; her transformation from homesickness to acceptance is earned through interiorizing the garden. However, the change is more gradual realization than dramatic choice, and contradictory impulses are not strongly active in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (home redefined as practice) with legible cost in her permanent vigil. Orientation clear early; persistent constraint (pendant, garden) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen garden is vividly sensory and constrains choice (interiorization); it charges the final image of accumulated stillness. Environment is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (homesickness vs. acceptance) escalate through guardian's active waiting and interiorizing; cost is her feral transformation and enduring vigil. Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (uncertainty, home as practice) emerges through concrete images and events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in pendant's warmth and guardian's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice is poetically distinct with strong perceptual signature ("luminescence frayed into mist"). Rhythmic control supports accumulative pattern; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific; synthesis of feral guardian, frozen garden, and dimensional homesickness feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes.</comment>
