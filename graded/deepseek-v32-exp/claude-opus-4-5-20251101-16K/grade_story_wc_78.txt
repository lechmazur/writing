<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veluna's characterization is concrete and embodied; her motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned endurance (exhaustion, fallen apples). The final choice is rooted in prior causality (her training, the mallet's use) with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is filtered through professional perception and physical strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: pressure builds through sensory and rhythmic density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("exhausted hand," "battered but whole"). Orientation is immediate; the pattern of fractal generating is taught early and pays off at closure, cohering the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice (raft limits movement, storm necessitates action) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Veluna's expertise (reading clouds, feeling vibrations). The floating orchard functions as micro-setting, tool, and antagonist, fully integrated with the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/freshwater) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Veluna's decision to play the storm as an instrument tightens options and deepens the cost. The storm's violence harmonizing with her rhythms is a decisive intensification with legible cost (exhaustion, physical toll).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (transforming chaos into music/survival) emerges organically from concrete actions and the core concept of "sketched resonance." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the orchard drifting on, the boundary dissolved. No moralizing; subtext operates through the fusion of obstacle and instrument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature (prophetic, rhythmic, tactile) that modulates with pressure without losing coherence. The prose's lyrical rhythm is taught early and sustained, serving the accumulative drive. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("restless euphony" appears twice) is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion matches the storm's tempo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis (floating agrarian prophecy, sound-based navigation). The premise is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
