<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veris's motivation is clear and embodied; her growth from solitude to community is earned through specific actions like the sculpture dedication, with visible cost and no slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through relational density; closure is a resonant reconfiguration of belonging with cost legible in the final image of the sculpture and shared search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vivid and constrain choices, charging the closure; setting actively shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Veris's agency in the search and kinship-building; the dedication scene imposes a cost that reweights her place in the community under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from the search and sculpture; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perception is filtered through Veris's bias, and prose rhythm supports emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts; sentences advance character and atmosphere with controlled figurative language and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, street art mystery, and kinship; specific details like marsh-reed weaving transform tropes with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
