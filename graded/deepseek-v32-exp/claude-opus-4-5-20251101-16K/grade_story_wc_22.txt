<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and embodied; the coachman's ritualistic seeding arises from wartime trauma and a need to "find something worthy of all that motion." Interior contradiction is shown through his patient, doomed work. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("longer than he had left").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the coachman commits to continuing his slow reclamation, foreclosing other paths with a felt cost. Orientation is immediate, and the cost is legible in the final paragraph's temporal acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable; the jetty constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the coachman's professional perception. The "narrow vastness" of the aftermath is a micro-setting that shapes the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming the battlefield) is signaled early. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening via the coachman's methodical seeding, driven by his agency. The cost is legible in the on-page acknowledgment that the work will outlast him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through "slow green work" emerges organically from image and action, avoiding statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of seeds waiting and the coachman's patient continuation. Subtext in the drowned treaty enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, anchored in the coachman's knowledge. The voice modulates with ritualistic gravity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the scholar) is purposeful and paid off in method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously ("The narrow vastness of aftermath").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of wartime aftermath, ecological reclamation, and a linguist-coachman using bird calls is specific, fresh, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
