<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s obsession is concrete and rooted in trauma; his interiority shows contradictory hope and fear, and his acceptance of the flawed creature is earned by the causal chain and carries visible cost in his weeping and realization. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: his assembly and singing cause the hatch. Closure is a Decisive Change (egg hatches) and Conceptual Repricing (flaw becomes precious) with cost legible in "He wept" and the bittersweet song. Orientation is anchored within first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace and bioluminescent fungi are vivid, filtered through Aldric’s obsession; the setting charges the final image of flawed beauty in eternal night, and the egg as micro-setting constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) escalates through his assembly and desperate singing; agency drives the turn, and cost is unmistakable in the flawed creature and his tearful acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges through particulars—the flawed bird, the mechanical world—without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material via "perfection wasn’t the point" and the bittersweet song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice is distinct, lyrical, and reflects Aldric’s reverie and degradation; perceptual signature is strong (e.g., "hues of old dreams"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful; sentences vary in length and propulsion, accelerating to the hatch and decelerating at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of extinction, mechanical plague, and flawed genesis feels inevitable; the hanging palace and bittersweet creature are specific and irreplaceable; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes.</comment>
