<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margot's synesthesia and despair are concretely embodied, and her micro-choice to enter the maze and accept the coin reveals values under pressure. However, her initial motivation is somewhat passive (pulled by ribbons), and the ghost's revelation, while poignant, slightly edges toward diagnostic speech ("To lure possibility..."). The final endurance feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Margot's internal shift and the warm coin. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of sensory and temporal fragments coheres, teaching the maze's rule. Orientation is immediate. The final image reweights prior emptiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is masterfully filtered through synesthesia, making setting an active pressure. The maze's fractured time constrains navigation, and the orchard garden charges the final encounter. The tarot coin functions as a crucial micro-setting object, its warmth providing tangible closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant internal stake (despair vs. possibility) is signaled early and deepens through the maze's disorientation and Celeste's revelation. Margot's agency—following the sound, asking "Why?", accepting the coin—drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the lifted "gray fog."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of performance, echoes, and synesthesia. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer about hope and legacy without moralizing. The ghost's "reminder, not rescue" crystallizes the theme through specific action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through synesthetic perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The lyrical, accumulative voice is consistent and modulates effectively with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; all elision (time in the maze) is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Some figurative language ("voice tasted of copper and honey") is slightly ornate but voice-motivated. Information density is high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding artifacts dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, a stage ghost, and a fractured timeline is fresh and specific. The core concept isn't ornamental but shapes stakes and the final image. Emotional truth and specificity elevate it beyond template; the ending feels inevitable, not contrived.</comment>
