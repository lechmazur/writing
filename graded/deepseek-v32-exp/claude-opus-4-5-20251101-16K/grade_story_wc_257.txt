<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is concretely rooted in loss and transformation, shown through micro-choices (tracing stencil, guiding Marcus). Her Earned Stasis—continuing her work—is earned by prior causality. Marcus provides secondary pressure, his "curtains of intention" testing her philosophy without diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; patterns (jewelry, origami, stencil) build to a Charged Poise closure where grief's permission to change is reconfigured with felt cost in Vera's subdued ardor. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the final image of her ongoing work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—it is the only place where grief can be transformed. The tattoo stencil, a recurring object, charges the final theme. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, vivid without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can grief carry love forward?) escalates through Marcus's visit, a test of Vera's purpose. Under the accumulative lens, density increases in dialogue and the telescope image, reweighting the stake with cost in Marcus's breaking sound and the new constellations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (mourning jewelry, origami, stencil) and actions, avoiding moralizing. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer—"grief needed permission to change"—that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Vera) is stable, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains controlled; elision (observatory's rules) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is natural and advances theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("curtains of intention," "woman-shaped wound") is consistent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami coordinates, and timeless observatory into a coherent metaphor for grief work. Risk-taking (lyrical abstraction) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the concept is fully committed and transformed through specific character detail.</comment>
