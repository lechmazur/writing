<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia and desire for silence are concretely embodied; her patient corrosion of the lock and quest for the gilded hush reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization about her mother earns a transformative choice (carrying seeds) with visible cost (her contracted chest stretching).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the doll's vine sprouting reconfigures silence as seed, with felt cost in the return to the bunker. The inversion hour constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The xenial trellis and inversion hour are integral, constraining choice and supplying resources. The doll functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail (mineral quiet, gilded hush) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. confinement) escalates through Mira's pursuit of the rarest silence, tightened by the half-spent inversion hour. Agency drives the climax; the doll's transformation and her realization carry unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of burial vs. growth emerges through concrete images (bunker, vine). The mother's fate as scattered silences and the final image of seeds offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Close third-person POV with a distinct lyrical signature (silences as flavors, textures). Perceptual bias is consistent; rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (mother's vanishing) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs; peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, silence collection, and xenial trellis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes. Transformation of absence into seed is original and fully committed.</comment>
