<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amira’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with clear contradictory impulses (freezing versus navigating) acting in scene. Her final endurance—returning to tend seedlings—is earned by prior somatic practice and carries visible cost. No label-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis) with on-page cost ("feeling the aliveness of her grief"). Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure tightens around the photograph’s unfolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (arboretum, cliff, lighthouse) is vividly sensory and actively constrains choice—the soil, railing, and wind become somatic anchors. The environment charges the final image of seeds pushing through soil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating grief) escalates through Amira’s agency: she deliberately unfolds the photograph, lets the freeze happen, and uses somatic markers to find stillness. Cost is legible in her breath and the photograph’s threatened escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific images (automated lighthouse, photograph, seeds) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—tending what remains through sorrow—that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and filtered through Amira’s perceptual signature (gardener’s attention, trauma-narrowed focus). Lyrical, rhythmic prose remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("gray snow," "pearl of stillness") is precise and integrated; rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery with gardening and somatic markers feels inevitable. Specificity (henna on hands, automated lighthouse) avoids cliché; risk-taking in quiet, reflective plot heightens stakes.</comment>
