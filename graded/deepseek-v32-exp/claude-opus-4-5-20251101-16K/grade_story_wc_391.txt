<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is clear and rooted in grief-transformed patience; interiority is concrete with embodied contradiction ("the burning that never fully cooled"). Her final choice to send the signal is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the ice's tension and her calculated patience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (ice, moon paths) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (frozen lake as highway, viaduct disrupting compasses) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Sera's professional POV, with no generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Sera's agency in mapping and signaling, tightening stakes through density increase. The dominant stake (patient revolution) is signaled early, and cost is legible in her grief and the ice's restrained wildness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (fire/ice, glacier revolution) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the glacier metaphor, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetically controlled yet character-specific, and rhythmic modulation supports pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "ice groans, a sound of restrained wildness"), and sentence-level propulsion accelerates the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>The synthesis of patient revolution with natural mapping feels fresh and inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details (magnetic viaduct, moon paths), and risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
