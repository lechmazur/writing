<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and motivated, with patience embodied in micro-choices; however, the absence of contradictory impulses in scene prevents the 9+ quick test, capping the score. Final choice is earned by three years of causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation anchored early; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the scattered patterns and three-year wait. Persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the orchard and discarded items constrain the ritual and charge the final map. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding grandmother) escalates through Maren's agency in the ritual under the accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in the years of work and the transient seal. One meaningful tightening leads to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience and transformation emerges organically from particulars; subtext operates through image and action. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with pressure. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction heighten immediacy without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished with varied syntax; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing momentum. Line-level craft supports closure without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, cartography, and grief feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific setting and character. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
