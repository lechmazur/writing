<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inventive nature and commitment to the revolution. Her interiority is concrete and character-specific, shown through actions like adjusting the sundial and her calm under pressure. The final choice (freeing prisoners) is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, and the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (prisoners freed) and resonant reconfiguration (the Cradle's first spark) with conceptual cost legible in the empty quill holder and reset sundial. Causal lens holds tightly: blackout enables specific, time-pressured actions that culminate in escape. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the twenty-minute window shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous fort and its half-painted sundial are not just backdrop; they actively constrain choice (the coded signal) and charge the final image (its reset "to innocence"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional vigilance. The blackout transforms the setting into a tactical resource, integrating setting fully with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free prisoners undetected) is signaled early and tightens via the twenty-minute blackout window. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens—each action narrows options. Cost is legible in the risk of discovery and the reset sundial, though the successful escape mutes a more visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—ideas as sparks that cannot be contained—emerges organically from the parable, Mira's actions, and the final image of the empty quill holder. Subtext operates in the fort's oblivious illumination. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the parable explanation leans slightly toward explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perceptive, purposeful consciousness. Voice has a distinct, poetic texture ("silent as smoke") that modulates with tension without losing clarity. No head-hopping; dialogue (single line) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, avoiding muddle or ornament. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; information density is high, and the final image lands with clean, charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lock-sentinel revolutionary and coded sundial offer a fresh synthesis of prison-break tropes through specific, grounded details. The concept of a silent revolution of ideas feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. While not radically experimental, the execution is confident and integrated, with risk-taking balanced by clarity.</comment>
