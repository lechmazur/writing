<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Morrow's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her "sensitively perceptive" trait, which compels her high-stakes choice to hang the tapestry. Her emotional progression—from dry-eyed historian to someone whose eyes "grew suddenly wet"—is embodied and earned by the causality of her discovery. The final endurance (sitting beneath the tapestry) is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost, charged by her understanding of irreversible loss. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (wonder/grief) act simultaneously in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear from the start and holds tightly through closure, which is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The "bronze quiet" turning outside versus the "echo" of sleep inside reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The pattern of layered discovery—from diary to wall-resonance to tapestry—is taught early and pays off cleanly at the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is indispensable, functioning as both environment and a recurring object that constrains choice (Morrow must press its walls to "read" it) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Morrow's professional bias ("grain dust and book must"). Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, curved wall) is coherent and guides the action. The setting pressures the protagonist's unique method and supplies the story's central resource: remembered dreams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and pattern break: the discovery of dream-resonance in the walls reweights the dominant stake (preserving memory in a dreamless present) with profound cost. Agency is entirely Morrow's—her decision to probe the diary, press the wall, and hang the tapestry forecloses the path of passive cataloging. The price is legible in her tears and the final, aching image of "finding everything in nothing." No coincidence; pressure coheres from character-specific perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges immaculately from concrete particulars—the burned diary, the tactile wall, the woven dragons—avoiding any direct statement or moralizing. The core concept (displaced axis, lost dreams) integrates fully with the thematic exploration of memory and longing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that the "memory of dreaming persisted" in artifact and ache. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (pressing the palm, hanging the tapestry) and the final, quiet image of listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person filtered through Morrow's perceptive signature. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("bronze quiet," "sediment of secrets") that remains controlled and character-consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature—noticing the "residue of conversations" in stone—is unique and sustained. Rhythmic control is excellent, modulating from measured description to the poignant cadence of the final lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs (advancing story, deepening atmosphere, revealing character). Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("spiraled upward like a chambered nautilus"). No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Syntax varies beautifully to match emotional beats. The final paragraph is a masterclass in resonant closure, with each clause building toward the charged, conclusive image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a rare, specific synthesis of post-apocalyptic quiet, fantasy resonance, and literary introspection. The core premise—a historian who reads walls in a world without dreams—is fresh and fully committed to in its implications. Details are highly particular (half-burned diaries, amber-threaded tapestry) and feel organic, not ornamental. The transformation of the "dragon" trope into a symbol of lost subconsciousness is ingenious and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
