<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a "reckless idealist" is concrete and drives her to the trade; interior guilt is embodied without diagnostic speak. Her final choice to sacrifice her future is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the burning sensation and transformed card.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure lands with a decisive change (tarot card restored) and felt cost (Mira's future traded), underpinned by the persistent constraint of the card and tree shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and tree roots between bones are vivid and constrain choice—the tree is used for the trade. The burned tarot card as micro-setting charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieving destiny) escalates through Mira's agency from request to refusal to trade. Cost is unmistakable on-page as she sacrifices her future for a shared one, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and shared destiny emerges through events and symbols (tarot card, trade), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shared future, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet concrete, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, clear propulsion, and no loops or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, and closure is untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept of bartered destinies is fresh and fully integrated; risk-taking in the trade mechanism heightens stakes. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
