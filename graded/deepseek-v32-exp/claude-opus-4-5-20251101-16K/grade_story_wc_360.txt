<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesper's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete (e.g., sorrow as a parabolic curve), and her final choice to continue is earned. Slight diagnostic label-speak ("transposed empathy") is integrated into world logic without harming embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (crystalline ache, stars vanishing). Orientation is early and clear; constraint of vanishing stars shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting (topaz workshop) charges the final image through the "topaz fracturing" ache; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Vesper's perception. Micro-setting (halo fragment) constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving stars via empathy) escalates through vanishing stars, tightening pressure under accumulative lens. Vesper's agency in continuing her work forecloses paths with visible cost (ache, loss).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as mathematics to save the universe) emerges from particulars like borrowed personalities and pamphlets; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, mathematical). Voice modulates with pressure ("lucid turbulence"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, especially in peak beats like the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of transposed empathy, vanishing stars, and topaz workshop feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in blending mathematics with emotion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
