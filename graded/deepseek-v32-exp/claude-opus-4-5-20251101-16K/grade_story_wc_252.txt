<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between combative obligation and tender freedom is embodied in her choice to leave; her grace and ability to unlock hearts are shown through specific interactions with Henrik and Suti. The final detachment is earned by prior causality—the scrimshaw's pulse, the whale's call—with visible cost in abandoning her human life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from Vessels' gift to the whale's call to Mira's transformation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her departure reconfigures identity and subtly lifts the workers' burdens, with cost legible in "anchor chains" of pain and the vanished island.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and whalebone scrimshaw function as micro-settings that constrain choice (threshold world, map object) and charge the final image. Sensory details—"kelp forests," "pulse warm"—are selective, POV-filtered, and essential to the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. obligation escalates under causal lens via the whale's call, forcing Mira's agency in detaching. Cost is unmistakable on-page in her physical shedding and the workers' lingering tenderness, foreclosing her dock life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true nature emerges through concrete particulars—scrimshaw, island, confessions—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of her "dancing toward something real," reweighting prior pain as released.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with a lyrical, consistent voice; perception is character-specific, e.g., "fluid precision that made the rough work look like dancing." No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, sustaining a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines like "her skin took on a faint iridescence" advance character and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dock-worker realism with mythical transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details like the scrimshaw's carved lines.</comment>
