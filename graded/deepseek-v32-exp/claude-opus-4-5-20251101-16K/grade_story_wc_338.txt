<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's methodical curiosity is concretely embodied in her scrutiny of map details and layered ink, driving her investigation. Her motivation—to understand why a speaking place was sealed—escalates cleanly into higher-stakes action, though internal contradiction remains subtle. The final choice to share the whispers is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her acceptance that some maps must stay torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (map tear, notes, footage) tightens options, leading to the decisive change of reopening the vault. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in the realization that "some maps had to stay torn." Orientation is immediate; the researcher's disappearance is a motivated ellipsis that compounds pressure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (archival paper, limestone echoes) are selective and filtered through Elena's professional bias. The rain-scoured vault and the map's torn edge function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image of stones "gleaming like old teeth." Spatial choreography remains clear across shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the whispered chapel—escalates through Elena's agency: comparing footage reveals transforming frescoes, which forces her to contact the heritage board. One meaningful tightening (the discovery) forecloses passive observation and leads to the reopening with a visible cost in accepting irreducible mystery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the torn map, layered frescoes, and acoustic whispers, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "some chapels existed only in the space between speaking and hearing." Subtext operates through imagery and implication, earning its reflective weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and reflects Elena's methodical perception. Voice has a distinct texture—precise, archival—that modulates under pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal focalization remains clean, with purposeful compression in transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("stones gleaming like old teeth") is precise and charged. Information density is high; each line advances story, character, or atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of map framing, acoustic archaeology, and layered history feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept (whispered chapel) transforms a familiar mystery plot through specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking in quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
