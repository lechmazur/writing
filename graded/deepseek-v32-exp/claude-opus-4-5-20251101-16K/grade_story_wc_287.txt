<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is concrete and contradictory (“the ache of loving fragile things… quiet determination to tend them anyway”), with micro-choices under pressure that earn her final endurance; motivation clear and cost felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (“the vulnerability she kept shielded”); orientation clear, seasonal constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (fire escape, harbor, mirrors) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reflecting light against darkness) tightens via agency in mirror repositioning; escalation under accumulative lens through density increase, with cost legible in her tenderness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions; subtext in gestures (bitting gauge tooth) and final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice distinct (“wistfully pragmatic attention”) with perceptual signature; rhythmic control supports pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffold; figurative language coherent and vivid, advancing story without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lockmaster legacy and light-reflecting gardener; emotional specificity avoids template, risk-taking in quiet lyricism heightens stakes.</comment>
