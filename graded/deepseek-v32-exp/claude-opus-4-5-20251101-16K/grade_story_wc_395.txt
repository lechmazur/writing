<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from professional curiosity to personal quest. Her micro-choices (digging, lying, erasing traces) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to follow her mother's coordinates is earned by the revelation from Chen and the charged object of the patch. Interiority is concrete and embodied (heart hammering, blood chilled, trembling hands), though the emotional arc is direct without significant contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's understanding reconfigures her mission, crystallizing her choice to disappear with a felt cost of leaving her old life. The causal lens holds tightly: her investigation (effect) triggers Chen's confrontation (cause), which provides the key information (effect) motivating her final act. The orientation is immediate, and the two-shard structure (workplace scene into final reflection) is legible and purposeful. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's "refusal to forget."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "social network archive" and the patch function as potent micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smile thin as a razor cut," "ghost impression"). The archive's "strange temporal space" establishes a coherent tone. The patch is the key recurring object, its emblem driving the plot and its physical presence anchoring Mara's final realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under a causal lens. The dominant stake (finding the truth about her mother/7319) tightens meaningfully when Chen's confrontation transforms it from a digital puzzle into a lethal personal danger. Mara's choice to lie and then to erase herself is a decisive, costly turn that narrows options and forecloses her former life. The price—becoming a deleted file herself—is legible and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (nothing is truly erased; memory as resistance) emerges powerfully from the integration of concept (digital deletion), object (patch), and character action. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Chen picking up the patch) and implication. The story avoids thematic echo, earning its insight through the concrete particulars of Mara's journey and the conceptual repricing of "deletion."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third, and effectively filters the world through Mara's professional and personal lens ("brightly attentive to anomalies"). The voice has a distinct, slightly tech-lyrical texture ("echo of forgotten songs"). Dialogue is spare but potent, carrying significant subtext and threat (Chen's "You'd be surprised..."). The perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (the mother's exact fate) is purposeful, paying off in the final charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise, vivid, and highly functional, with strong information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The archive existed in a strange temporal space—across the echo of forgotten songs, as the old-timers called it."). Rhythm varies effectively with scene pressure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence shift lands the closure with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital memory keeper, a sci-fi conspiracy, and a personal mystery feels organic and fresh. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on data privacy and corporate power. Tropes (the missing parent, the hidden clue) are transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and the protagonist's unique skills. The story commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
