<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vela's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role and empathy. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like feeling vibrations and examining ice. The final choice to create the bloom is earned by her skills and observations, with visible cost in its temporary nature. However, contradictory impulses are minimal, limiting higher-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds seamlessly. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing ("learning to storm together") with on-page cost in the need for continual tending. The persistent constraint of the caves' amplification shapes tactics, and the ending reweights the premise with undeniable resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly woven into action, with the harmonic caves and ice cracks directly constraining Vela's choices. Sensory details (vibrations, frozen water) are selective and purposeful, reflecting her professional focus. The environment charges the final image through the new ripple marks, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding quiet is signaled early and escalates through Vela's agency under the Accumulative lens. Her examination of ice and use of the stone create a meaningful tightening, culminating in the bloom of hush. The cost is legible in the temporary, labor-intensive peace, foreclosing easy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Vela's struggle, culminating in the resonant, non-literal insight of "learning to storm together." Subtext operates through images like the hammered repose and the bloom, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on sound, vibration, and mapkeeper's precision. The lyrical voice modulates with pressure, using terms like "bloom of hush" that remain character-bound. No head-hopping; compression and rhythm support the Accumulative drive effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Metaphors ("trapped lightning," "hammered repose") are consistent and vivid, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image lands with crisp, charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of harmonic caves, energy beings as noise, and ice-crack cartography feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in concepts like "bloom of hush" heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors the premise in lived detail, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
