<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses (love vs. disapproval) are dramatized in scene, and her final choice to continue her father's project is earned by the journal's revelation with visible cost—her reconfigured grief and understanding. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost in the final image ("letting grief become understanding..."). Two-shard structure taught early; orientation is clear within 120 words. The journal's pattern reconfigures meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (library, lantern) is vividly selective and charges the final image; the mica-pane lantern recurs with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's POV, constraining choice and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her father's contradiction) escalates through the journal's accumulation, driven by Mira's agency. The cost is legible in her realization that "how small those lines had been" and her decision to traverse the same territory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of contradiction and meaning emerges through particulars (journal entries, lantern) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Mira's decision to ride the subway, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, mathematically tinged reflection. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting or loops. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is purposeful. High information density with clear propulsion; no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability, gambling, and subway graffiti as cartography of contradiction feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation through specific detail.</comment>
