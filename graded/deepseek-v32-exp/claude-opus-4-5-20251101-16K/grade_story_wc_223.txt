<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is deeply rooted in her trauma and her "benevolently ruthless" pursuit, with interiority shown through concrete memory. The final commitment to continue walking names is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira resolves to keep walking, with cost legible in the absent pawns and her personal loss. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the chessboard shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and chessboard are indispensable, constraining Mira's actions and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with spatial choreography clear in her walking pattern. No generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving small gestures) escalates under the accumulative lens through density of names and reflection, driven by Mira's agency. Cost is unmistakable in the missing pawns and her relentless pursuit, with one meaningful tightening to the final commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the chessboard and walking pattern, with subtext in metaphor and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of walking names into stone, no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Mira's perception. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscurity, and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere; figurative language is precise and integrated. No overwriting or artifact muddles the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crisis actor, whispering gallery, and historian of small gestures feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and details are specific and transformative.</comment>
