<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's reticence and motivation are consistently embodied; her internal shift to readiness to speak is earned by years of vigil, with cost visible in her weathered innocence and the library's hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—language as wilderness—with cost legible in Mira's realization and the crystal's role; orientation clear early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library and crystal function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "dust-choked windows" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving language alive) escalates through Mira's auditory fragments and impending testimony; her agency in deciding to testify carries cost in her altered worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of language as living entity emerges from crystal fragments and Mira's arc; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant wilderness imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm mirrors Mira's scholarly vigilance, and elision (e.g., crystal mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is flawless: high density without loops, figurative language enhances momentum, and sentences like "Dawn pressed against the eastern windows" propel story with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and fully committed; synthesis of crystal, library, and linguistic evolution feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet conceptual stakes heightening coherence.</comment>
