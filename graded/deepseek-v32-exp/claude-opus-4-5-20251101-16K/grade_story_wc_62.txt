<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and embodied; her "fierce meditation" and tracing of the ribbon roll reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to design a spiral memorial is earned by spectral visits and retracing, with cost legible in accepting her grandmother's departure. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: grandmother's visits drive retracing, poem recall, and epiphany. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the understanding that inheritance transcends breath. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks or convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse and monarch migration are indispensable: they constrain choice (visitations occur here) and charge the final image of wings and flight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the ribbon roll functions as micro-setting that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (designing collective grief memorial) escalates via Miriam's agency—retracing commissions, remembering poems—culminating in the "thundering calm" epiphany. Cost is unmistakable in her acceptance of loss and mentorship's end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief, memory, and inheritance emerges organically from monarch imagery, spectral visits, and the spiral design. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in "carrying their dead forward" deepens reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: the gravestone carver's worldview filters description. Voice is poetic yet controlled; dialogue (minimal) is natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language ("wings like stained glass") serves pressure and closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, monarch migration, and spectral mentorship feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices; emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
