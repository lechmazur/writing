<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory impulses (scientific detachment vs. latent grief) act simultaneously in scene, anchored in concrete micro-choices like touching the dust and ignoring the damp bench. Her final choice to call her mother is earned by the accumulating pressure of the butterfly dust revelation, with visible cost in her cracked voice and the foreclosed path of emotional avoidance. Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elena calls her mother, reconfiguring her stance from processing to connection with a felt cost. The inferred drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly: details of decay, dust, and memory build density that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is immediate; structure is a seamless single scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not just described but constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as a crucible for Elena's realization. Sensory details (iridescent dust, warped benches, dampness) are filtered through her POV and are selective, purposeful, and integral to the emotional escalation. The setting's state directly enables the key discovery and the story's thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional avoidance vs. engagement) is signaled early and escalates through an accumulative deepening via the butterfly dust discovery. The protagonist's agency—the shift from assessment to the vulnerable phone call—forecloses a path with a clear, on-page cost (the collapse of her "preprocessing" armor). Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of stellar and human decay, avoiding direct statement. The core concept of gradual change is realized through specific, resonant particulars (butterfly dust, magnetar cooling, her mother's fading memory). The ending offers a non-literal, profound answer through the final image of "the universe compress[ing]" into a humble moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person, with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision ("preprocessed reality") and lyrical observation ("dust smeared across her fingertip like a whisper"). Voice modulates cleanly with emotional intensity under pressure. The single focalization is controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is precise and integrated ("accumulated like sediment," "unarmored"). Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively, accelerating the realization and pausing for the quiet phone call. Information density is high, with nearly every line advancing character, atmosphere, or theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysical and intimate decay is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, verifiable details (neutron star density, butterfly wing scales) ground the high-concept analogy. The story commits fully to its premise, transforming a familiar emotional arc through a unique, risk-taking perspective that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
