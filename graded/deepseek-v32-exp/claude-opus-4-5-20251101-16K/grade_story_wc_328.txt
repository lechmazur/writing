<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction (scientific rigidity vs. thawing wonder) is concrete and embodied; her final renunciation is earned by the arrowhead’s revelation and the garden’s offer, with visible cost in career ruin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal/Hybrid lens holds; closure is a decisive change (replacing arrowhead, leaving empty-handed) with felt cost articulated; orientation is immediate, and the arrowhead constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly specific and actively constrains choice (arrowhead placement, hovering water); it charges the final image of Elena’s departure and is integral to the story’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bitterness vs. wonder) escalates via Elena’s agency—her taking of the arrowhead triggers the garden’s metamorphosis and the phone’s offer—culminating in a costly, irreversible choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness transformed into “cosmic joke” emerges through concrete images (arrowhead, static confessions) and the final non‑literal answer; no moralizing, resonant ambiguity remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific yet poetic); voice remains coherent under pressure, and the phone‑confession dialogue carries subtext without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with vivid figurative language that never muddles; sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and there are no scaffold loops or artifacts that dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cryptid research, magical garden, and grief‑turned‑wonder feels inevitable; specific details (flint arrowhead, static‑laden phone) avoid template plots, and risk‑taking heightens stakes.</comment>
