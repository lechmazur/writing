<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's emotionally rational characterization is consistent and drives her persuasive choice; internal conflict between truth and consequence is embodied, and the final decision is earned with visible cost in the loss of the saint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is decisive with cost legible in the ending image; causal lens holds tightly from rose petal to persuasion; orientation is immediate and clear, with the petal drop as a persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. noble lie escalate through Miriam's agency in dialogue; cost is unmistakable in the discussion of charities and historical harm, driving a meaningful tightening.</comment>
