<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her interiority is concrete (e.g., "the title felt hollow") and her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, some emotional states are told rather than embodied ("infinitely tired"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with legible cost ("seventeen days older and infinitely tired"). Orientation is immediate, and the sealed-awakening sequence provides clear, motivated linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (observatory, automaton) and charges the final image (stars settled). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's scholarly POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find father) escalates through sequential loop-closing, each tightening options and raising knowledge. Mira's agency drives escalation, and cost is visible in her relearning and father's exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge reconstructed through completion emerges organically; final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the automaton's exposition lightly risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, slightly poetic texture. The automaton's dialogue is mechanically apt. Minor register drift in peak beats ("infinitely tired") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled ("scattered like ash"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of runes, automaton, and celestial rearrangement feels organic and inevitable. The core concept (sealed awakenings) transforms a familiar quest into a unique, fully committed premise.</comment>
