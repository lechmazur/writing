<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in past guilt, with interiority shown through concrete details like the drawer pull. The final choice to give it away is earned by prior causality, and cost is visible in her empty pocket. Slight tell in backstory integration prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration: Elena accepts inner neutral territory, cost felt in the empty pocket. Causal lens holds tightly from past error to present action. Orientation is anchored early, and structure is a seamless single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the parapet and mist creating atmospheric pressure. The drawer pull functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, elevating specificity beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, from reflection to the decisive act of giving the drawer pull. Dominant stake (internal conflict) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the relinquishment of her talisman.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, notably the drawer pull's transformation. The ending offers a non-literal answer about inhabiting the space between apology and forgiveness, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and perceptually distinct, with Elena's thoughtful voice consistent throughout. Lyrical prose modulates under pressure, and any elision (e.g., backstory) is anchored in present cues, teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("mist clung... like a grieving thing") is precise and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific synthesis—guilt-driven negotiator, moon-phase mechanics, and talisman object. Emotional truth is particular, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
