<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's grief and defiance are embodied through concrete sensory details and micro-choices; her final decision to "make light anyway" is earned by the discovered note and Sava's memory, with cost felt in her laughter between grief and recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost in the final image of sparks falling; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density and cadence shift; orientation is clear early with chanting and fortress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choice: the blooming fortress houses the mosaic note, and the starless night charges the final firework display; micro-settings like the mosaic basin and kerosene rag knot constrain action and reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) escalates through Mira's agency in finding the note and lighting fireworks; cost is visible in her use of Sava's rag knot and changed chanting, tightening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—making light in darkness—without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of repeated rockets, subtext deepened by Sava's playful seriousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure (e.g., chanting shifts from formulas to Sava's name); no head-hopping, and purposeful elision (ambient awareness) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("purple waterfalls") is selective and coherent; sentence propulsion accelerates with Mira's actions, clarity untouched in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks designer, blooming fortress, and mosaic note feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity in grief and defiance avoids template plots.</comment>
