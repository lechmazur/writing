<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and contradictory (caution vs. surrender), with micro-choices under pressure (using the lantern, breathing in the rose). Her final choice to open the vial is earned by prior causality, and her endurance of grief forecloses her path of fear with visible, wept cost. The 9+ test is satisfied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and emotional layers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Maren's stance shifts from fear to acceptance; cost is legible in her tears and the final image of "grief transmuted." Orientation is immediate, structure is a single coherent scene, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vividly specific and pressures choice (the rose's transformation times her visit). It charges the final image ("crystal shadows... glittered like grief transmuted"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional POV. The 9+ test is met as the environment constrains tactics and reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates under the accumulative lens via Maren's agency: using the ultraviolet lantern reveals the message, inhaling the rose's scent deepens the confrontation. The tightening forecloses her option of avoidance, with cost paid in her on-page weeping. The quick test for agency-driven escalation with unmistakable cost is passed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief, memory, acceptance) emerges entirely through particulars—the vial, the rose, the lantern—without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of light revealing "the love we forgot to see." Epiphany is earned through specific struggle; no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (lantern broker's attention to light and scent). Voice is consistently poetic yet character-bound. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure (e.g., shorter sentences during realization). No head-hopping or elision issues; the taught pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, purposeful, and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., the vial's inscription does multiple jobs). Rhythm varies naturally; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level craft supports the accumulative texture without obscuring clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (lantern broker, ultraviolet revelation, extinct botany, olfactory memory) feels fresh and organic. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The emotional truth is specific, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes through grounded particulars.</comment>
