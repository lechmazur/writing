<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is concrete and consistent; her pragmatic endurance and private rebellion are embodied in micro-choices (polishing marbles, touching the hedge). Her final, quiet victory is earned by prior causality—three years of tending that manifested a "deeper truth." Inspector Chen’s swift change is a slight softness, but his reaction is cued by the garden's visible response, keeping it within credible bounds for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of deception, cracked marbles, and garden responsiveness builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with clear cost: Chen’s decision to "lose" the order carries professional risk, and Mara’s ritual of cracking another marble marks the cost of continued, fragile survival. Orientation is immediate; structure is a single, coherent scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden maze is not just backdrop but a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara’s expertise (yellowed leaves, polished cracks). The environment actively pressures the climax—the hedge regenerating at her touch is the decisive proof that reconfigures the inspector’s understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maze’s survival) is signaled early and tightens credibly with the inspector’s arrival. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency—her prepared confession and demonstration. The cost is legible in Chen’s subverted authority and Mara’s continued, commemorative rebellion. Under the accumulative lens, the single decisive intensification (the inspection) sufficiently reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between quantified luck and organic recognition. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"gardens remember"—through the image of simultaneous blooming and withering. No moralizing; the conceptual repricing (what constitutes "fortune") is earned by the garden’s response and the marbles’ cracked testimony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara’s perception, yielding a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "hedges rose like old friends"). Voice is consistent, with a rhythmic, pragmatic lyricism suited to her character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in Chen’s halted realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("cracked marbles... rebellion recorded in broken glass"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the beat, accelerating to the inspection and slowing in reflective moments. No loops, scaffold, or register drift to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a quantified-luck dystopia with the intimate, cyclical wisdom of gardening feels fresh and inevitable. The cracked marbles as a record of deception and defiance are a specific, irreplaceable invention. The risk of a quiet, earned-stasis closure heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
