<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Della's motivation is concrete and drives micro-choices under pressure; her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the foregone revenge. Interiority is embodied and specific, e.g., "something broken in his throat, in his chest." No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "betrayal's frequency still ringing in her ears." Orientation is anchored early; the truce of hush persistently shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressure-bearing, with the pirate market and watch fob constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Della's POV, e.g., "lanterns throwing copper light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding trust breaking) escalates through Della's agency; false starts tighten options, and the cost of her choice is unmistakable on the page. Coherent pressure under causal lens leads to a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("some broken things, known fully, hurt less than mysteries") without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet grounded, e.g., "the pirate market breathed its nightly breath." Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("sharp as ice giving way underfoot"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable; the concept of "capturing the sound of trust breaking" transforms familiar tropes through specific detail and risk-taking in the quiet ending. Authenticity of vision is clear.</comment>
