<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are concrete and embodied; her transformation from mourner to keeper is earned through micro-choices under pressure, with visible cost in the forged awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page in the absorption of ghosts and shift from brittle to forged awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the tidal library and brass sundial charge the final image, constraining choice and enriching theme without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose vs. isolation) escalates through ghost dialogues; Elara's agency drives a meaningful tightening into independence, with cost legible in the forged awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and dialogue, though a slight thematic echo occurs when Elara articulates isolation vs. independence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is poetic and consistent with perceptual signature; dialogue (with ghosts) serves subtext and advances the arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated; line-level craft supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized uniquely; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
