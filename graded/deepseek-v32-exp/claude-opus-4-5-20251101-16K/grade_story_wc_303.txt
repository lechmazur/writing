<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict is embodied in concrete details like the "mulberry ache"; her final choice to write the true report is earned by prior causality (plant telepathy, coffee stains) with visible cost in the dimming promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly from discovery to decision; closure is a decisive change on-page with cost legible in "some dreams were worth more than the empires," and the violin's truth persistently constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory and ice violin function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "burgundy folds" and "crystalline tone" are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weighing dream against empire escalates via plant telepathy and coffee stain readings; protagonist agency drives a meaningful tightening with cost unmistakable in the forfeited dream.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus sanitized history emerges through resonant images (colonized stars, distorted violin); ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical signature; perceptual bias (e.g., roses whispering) and rhythmic control under pressure are consistent, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and figurative language like "perforated destiny" remains coherent and supports closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism (plant telepathy, ice violin) with moral dilemma feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and elements are organically integrated.</comment>
