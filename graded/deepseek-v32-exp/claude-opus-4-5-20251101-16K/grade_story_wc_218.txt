<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren’s serene resolve and unsettling contradiction are embodied in her methodical actions; her final choice to restore the network is earned by decades of observation and the urgent cost of her dwindling time, with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain from diagnosis to restoration holds cleanly; closure lands with a decisive change (her integration into the network) and felt cost (her death) under a hybrid lens dominated by causality; the six-month constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living temple orchard is not merely backdrop—it constrains choices (copper wire, climbing) and charges the final image of woven growth; sensory details are selective, filtered through Maren’s expertise, and essential to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring symbiosis before death) escalates through Maren’s agency under the causal lens; the tightening is gentle but tangible as time dwindles and she can no longer climb, with cost legible in her peaceful death and the network’s acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of interspecies respect and legacy emerge organically from Maren’s concrete actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of woven growth, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a perceptual signature that reflects Maren’s gentle systematicity; voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise, and no head-hopping or register drift obscures closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle—even in peak beats, sentences advance story and character while maintaining clarity and propulsion to the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of living architecture, terminal diagnosis, and ecological restoration feels inevitable; risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical payoff is fully integrated, with specificity that avoids template plots and charges the closure.</comment>
