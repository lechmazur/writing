<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Madeline's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion ("heavy as a stone"). Her final release of love is earned by prior discoveries and her own confession, with visible cost in her lighter chest. Contradictory impulses of holding versus releasing love are dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her decision to become the booth's keeper. Orientation is clear early; causality links her readings to personal catharsis. The film strips' constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the projection booth and film strips enable psychometry and revelations. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of the booth as a "post office for the heart." No generic placeholder issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates through accumulative density of readings, driven by Madeline's agency. Cost is legible in her release and commitment to return. One meaningful tightening deepens her understanding and personal stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unexpressed love emerges through particulars without moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Madeline's release and new role, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical control ("hushed thunder," "cataract of accumulated tenderness"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear; sentences advance story and character. No scaffold or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of psychometry, unused love, and film history; emotional truth is specific and grounded. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
