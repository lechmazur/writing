<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation is clear, rooted in tradition and tenderness, and her actions align consistently. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict, limiting complexity; her serene competence is unwavering under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera completes the ritual and reflects on preserved sparks; cost is felt in the solemn duty at oblivion’s edge. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the ritual pattern taught and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are indispensable, constraining choice (burial winds, chip interaction) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with the ritual’s progress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the spark) is clear and escalated through the ritual’s accumulative intensity, but lacks external pressure or tangible cost. Agency is present but stakes remain abstract, without a tested trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ritual and image, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the emerald chip offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of memory and preservation, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Vera’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening the closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of beautician mortician, emerald chip, and skyborne ritual feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, quiet plot pays off with a fresh, non-obvious angle on death and memory.</comment>
