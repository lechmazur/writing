<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her serenity after the argument and the earned epiphany show contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to reverse her role is motivated by prior reflection on the story stick and dome, with visible cost in her renunciation of performer’s remove.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s realization that stories “teach you to see in the dark” reweights the premise with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate, and the dome’s listening function persists as a constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image through its “listening” purpose. Sensory details like “white shell” and “meteor hush” are filtered through Mira’s POV, creating atmospheric coherence without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling vs. clarity) escalates via Mira’s agency under the accumulative lens: her reflection tightens into a reversal that forecloses her old method with cost legible in the decision to “sit among them.” No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—story stick, dome, puppet shows—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: “the best stories… taught you to see in the dark.” No moralizing; subtext operates through silence and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., “meteor hush”). No head-hopping; elision (like Marcus’s departure) is taught and paid off in Mira’s epiphany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“like the inside of a skull”) is consistent and clarity-focused; peak beats avoid muddle, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of puppetry, radar dome, and story stick feels inevitable; fresh angle on listening vs. speaking transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet epiphany heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
