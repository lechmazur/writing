<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance is embodied through concrete micro-choices (nodding in meetings, painting at night) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her interior contradiction—the "splinter in her heart"—is shown, not told, and her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: "impossibly heavy with meaning." The stone chip anchors her motivation in generational memory, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Council's accelerated timeline forces Mira's painting, which triggers community action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost: "she would carry her dual allegiance... impossibly heavy." Orientation is clear within 120 words (Mira, the Drift, present). The final image of dawn painting and people moving reconfigures stakes without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the floating carnival's "neon veins" and "outer rafts" pressure choices (gentrification vs. mobility) and charge the final image. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira's choices and symbolizing memory. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "grooves worn smooth," "azure paint").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) escalates via Council's accelerated timeline, forcing Mira's agency—encoding messages—which narrows options and raises cost. The tightening is causal and legible: her painting directly leads to "her people read her messages and began to move." Cost is felt in her dual allegiance and the impending fight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. privatization, resistance through art) emerges organically from particulars: the stone chip, graffiti codes, carnival's "aggressive joy." Subtext operates in Mira's silent rebellion and the encoded murals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "desperation learned to dance with hope," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters through Mira's orderly intuitive perception. Voice has a distinct texture ("neon veins," "carnival spun on") that modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven (Tomás's "How bad?"). Prose rhythm supports the accumulating tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("splinter in her heart," "carnival's neon veins"). Information density is high; each sentence advances character, setting, or conflict. Closure image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gentrification conflict within a floating carnival setting feels fresh and inevitable. The culture shock absorber role and encoded graffiti art are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in poetic language and dual-allegiance structure pays off without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
