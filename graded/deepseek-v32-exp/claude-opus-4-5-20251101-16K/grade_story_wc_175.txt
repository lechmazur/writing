<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as an esoteric realist is concrete and consistent; her practical yet poetic approach to loss is embodied in micro-choices like knotting with intention, and her final stance of watchful endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot coheres around Mira's ritual; closure lands with Charged Poise as the moth wing catches light, making the cost of extinction felt without resolution, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and moth wing create a vivid micro-setting; the wing's iridescence charges the final image, constraining the memorial's meaning and elevating atmosphere to thematic necessity, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are tightly braided: honoring extinction during the last monarch migration; escalation is a cadence shift into acceptance under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the silent, unreceived signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted cadence emerges through concrete particulars—moth wing, monarchs, ephemeral structures—subtext rich in silence, and the final image reweights loss without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic yet precise, mirroring Mira's esoteric realism; POV stability and perceptual signature heighten pressure through selective, character-filtered detail, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no scaffold; figurative language like "small blue flame" serves closure without muddle, and information density advances story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of esoteric realism, ephemeral architecture, and extinction ecology; specific details transform tropes into a singular, inevitable vision with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
