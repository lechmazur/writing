<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus is consistently drawn with a whimsical attentiveness that drives his investigation and eventual foundation; his motivation is clear and his final choice is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal and the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (foundation established) and resonant reconfiguration (locket displayed, Marcus listening); causal lens holds without breaks; orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the shift of his life's work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the library and locket charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the environment does not heavily constrain choices beyond providing context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving the mystery) escalates through Marcus's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs as he finds Vera and arranges the reunion; cost is legible in his invested time and altered priorities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cycles of compassion emerges organically from events and images; subtext operates through gesture and object; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and voice is distinct, reflecting Marcus's perceptive nature; prose has a lyrical, attentive texture; dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific maritime details and a quiet meditation on compassion; transformation of a misaddressed letter into a cycle of gratitude is organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
