<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is clear and rooted in his father's legacy; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Final choice to step through the door is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though internal conflict is more narrative than scene-simultaneous.</comment>
