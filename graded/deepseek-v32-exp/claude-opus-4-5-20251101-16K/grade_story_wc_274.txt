<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior conflict is concrete and embodied ("hands trembled—not from cold"), and her final choice is earned by prior causality (seven years in the archive, mapping networks, personal loss). Slight deduction for diagnostic label ("bravely conflicted") in an otherwise dramatized beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost (she waits, "Let them come") and a persistent constraint (dormant networks) shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (hexagonal stacks, perpetual chill, dormant networks) constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("breath visible," "brittle page"). The archive functions as both environment and micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. stability) escalates through Mira's agency; one meaningful tightening at the transmission key. Cost is visible (she will be caught) and felt (personal grief). Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (truth, silence, burial) emerges from particulars (frozen words, contraband letter) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the conversation would be brutal... finally be true."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, pressure-modulated voice ("dizzying quiet... like depth pressure"). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is coherent and supports closure. No artifacts that obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise (cryogenic archive of dangerous truths) is fresh and fully committed. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (quiet, charged ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details are irreplaceable.</comment>
