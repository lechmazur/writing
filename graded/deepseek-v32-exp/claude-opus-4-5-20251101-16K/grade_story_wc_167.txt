<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (throwing stones) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final decision to keep creating beauty is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the impending loss. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (resignation vs. defiance) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; orientation is anchored early. Closure is a Charged Poise (resonant reconfiguration) with felt cost on-page in "contracts were being signed" vs. "one more breath." The persistent constraint of the developers' arrival shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (Pearl Bay, prism atrium) constrains choice and charges the final image through specific, POV-filtered sensory detail. The atrium functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and embodies the central stake. No generic placeholder; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty vs. development) escalates under Accumulative lens via deepening imagery and the imminent deadline. Maren's agency in deciding to keep throwing stones forecloses passive acceptance with legible cost. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the mundane, transparency requiring structure) emerges organically from concrete images (ripples, noctilucent clouds, atrium). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication and pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, reflecting Maren's profession and temperament. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., developer details) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. No register drift or artifact muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar themes through specific, irreplaceable details (glazier, prism atrium, noctilucent reckonings). Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
