<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Father Mattias's method is rooted in consistent traits; Corrine's interior contradiction (worthlessness vs. truth) is embodied and her change earned. The final renunciation of the lie carries emotional cost through her tears and gasp. Micro-choices (pressing the pedal, tracing symbols) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Mattias asks probing questions, Corrine's hidden assumption collapses, expelling the entity. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Corrine's trembling, absorbed symbols). Orientation is immediate; the dimensional anchor and stakes are clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is vividly specific and constrains choice (walls shift, anchor stabilizes with sound). It charges the final image ("the dimensional anchor hummed around them, its stillness restored"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mattias's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save Corrine before integration) tightens via the 20-minute deadline and the entity's resistance. Escalation is driven by Mattias's agency—his questions force Corrine's revelation. Cost is legible in her convulsions, tears, and the entity's shriek.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. hidden assumptions) emerges through concrete action—the exorcism method and Corrine's memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Mattias's final line about hearing one's own truth. No moralizing; subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and character-specific (entity's broken-glass voice, Corrine's whisper). Perceptual signature is clear: Mattias's attention to sound, silence, and dimensional shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("like a patient ghost") is purposeful and consistent. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor hairline slip: "muffled clarity" is slightly abstract but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism, psychological inquiry, and speculative elements (dimensional anchor, Threshold Gray). Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices. Emotional truth anchors the originality; the closure image (saving silence) feels inevitable and resonant.</comment>
