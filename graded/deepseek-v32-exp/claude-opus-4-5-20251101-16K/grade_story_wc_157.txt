<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect defiance is clear and drives her leadership; interiority is present but lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene. Her final choice to distribute seeds is earned by the Phase Three threat, with cost visible in the rebellion's risk. However, emotional embodiment leans toward label-like descriptions (e.g., "charming, disarming smile") without intense internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; causal lens holds with threat leading to plan. Closure is a Charged Poise: the seed distribution and luna moth image reconfigure stakes with conceptual cost of rebellion. The persistent constraint of taxation shapes tactics, but the cost is more implied than vividly felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (greenhouse humidity, condensation-streaked glass) and constrains choice as sanctuary. The gourd rattle seed charges the final image. However, the score is capped because Q2 is not ≥9.0, though the environment actively supports theme and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resisting taxation) escalates cleanly with Phase Three announcement. Mira's agency drives the plan to plant seeds, with cost legible in the danger of defiance. Under causal lens, this is a meaningful tightening, though the price is not yet paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of growth versus control emerges through concrete images (seeds, moths) without moralizing. The ending line "seeds don't pay taxes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Score capped due to Q2 not ≥9.0, but subtext is richly integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("speak in blooms"). Dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though rhythm occasionally leans toward ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with varied rhythm and high information density; no obvious loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "humid air like a confession"). Minor register drift in peak beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of taxable thoughts is fresh, integrated creatively with garden-based rebellion. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure supports stakes. Capped due to Q2 not ≥9.0, but originality is high.</comment>
