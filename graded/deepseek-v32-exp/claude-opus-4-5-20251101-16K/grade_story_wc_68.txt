<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vero's interiority is concretely embodied through his handling of the cog and reflection on sediment layers. His motivation—preserving truth against convenient lies—intensifies under pressure, leading to earned endurance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and his final choice is rooted in prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis with legible cost in his calibration "against despair." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through layered reflections. Orientation is clear early, and the sewer environment shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the sewer's "abrasive calm" mirrors Vero's stance. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his philosophical bias. The cog as micro-setting actively pressures his decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of truth—escalates through Vero's agency under the Accumulative lens. His decision to hide the cog forecloses easier paths with cost legible in his isolation. Pressure tightens via density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: sediment layers, competing narratives, and the cog as symbol. Subtext operates through image and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; Vero's voice is philosophical and reflective, consistent under pressure. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is flawless: high information density without padding, varied sentence rhythm, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and enhances clarity. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes post-plague decay, philosophical resistance, and archeological precision into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in quiet, endurance-based closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
