<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot accumulates through reflective beats anchored in the present, leading to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: she will walk the distance, carrying guilt as sediment. The accumulative lens holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station is vividly rendered with sensory detail, and the ivy, dust, and graffiti charge the final image. The setting functions as a micro-setting that mirrors her internal ruin and solace, though it does not actively constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates through the discovery of the graffiti and her reflection on her father's words. The cost is legible in her decision to carry guilt differently, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river imagery, map references, and graffiti wisdom without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forgiveness is a map, and she must walk the distance.</comment>
