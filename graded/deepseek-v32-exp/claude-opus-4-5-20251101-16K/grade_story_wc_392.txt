<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is concrete and driven by consistent traits; her final choice to call Internal Affairs is earned by her professional rigor and the revelation of her supervisor's betrayal. The "fortified vulnerability" concept is embodied in her ability to hold steady under the memory onslaught, making her endurance and decisive action credible. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("fortified vulnerability, her therapist had called it") in a peak beat, but it is quickly anchored in on-page action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly: the lantern trigger leads to visions, revelation of cover-up, and her decisive call. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (calling Internal Affairs) with on-page cost felt in the burden of memories she now carries. The persistent constraint of the supervisor's control shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The subway tunnel and lantern function as micro-setting that directly constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (damp concrete, cracked glass, distant trains). The tunnel’s spatial choreography is clear, and the environment mirrors the layers of history Maya uncovers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth and breaking control) escalates cleanly from investigation to supernatural encounter to confrontation of systemic corruption. The tightening is driven by Maya’s agency—touching the lantern, processing the memories, deciding to act. Cost is legible in the ghosts of memory settling into her bones and the risk she now faces.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of historical memory, justice, and carrying witness emerge organically from the lantern’s function and Maya’s arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she will carry the memories as evidence, reweighting the premise. No moralizing; the final image of the tunnel humming with layers of history deepens the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maya’s professional, observant consciousness. Voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic propulsion in key beats (e.g., "The tunnel fell away"). No head-hopping; elision (the memory flashes) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially in the memory sequences. No noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. A single minor paraphrase loop ("Preventable. All of it preventable.") is intentional and charged, not an artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical supernaturalism with a modern investigative thriller is fresh and fully integrated. The lantern as a memory-vessel and the cover-up by a predecessor feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the compressed memory flashes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
