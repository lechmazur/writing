<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is profound, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion shown through whittling and theatrical narration. Her moral ambiguity and the "remade hush" are dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. The final stance of becoming her own ghost is earned with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images to a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with cost in the final image of her as a ghost; the lens holds without contradiction, and persistent constraints (mandate, turbines) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: wind turbines and farmhouse pressure choices, while dried flowers and wooden birds charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, constraining choice and enriching atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's internal conflict between performed lightness and true grief. Escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density increase and pattern break (e.g., crumbling lavender). Agency in her endurance drives tightening, with cost legible in her emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges naturally from events and images—whittled birds, dried flowers, remade hush—without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost image, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, with Mira's theatrical narration filtering perception. POV remains consistent; prose rhythm reflects her state under pressure. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature is character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; no artifacts obscure causality or closure. Line-level craft supports momentum and the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high, transforming dystopian tropes through specific details like whittling and the happiness mandate. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
