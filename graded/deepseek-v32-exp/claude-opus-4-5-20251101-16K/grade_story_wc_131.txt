<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and motivated; her interior contradiction (invisibility vs. purpose) acts in scene, and the final choice to become visible is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("a lock finally turning"). The girl serves as a credible crucible, though less detailed, fitting the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on the page; the accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of invisibility shapes tactics, and the ending reweights meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated through sensory selectivity and POV bias; the library environment constrains choices (crawl spaces, hidden passages) and decisively charges the final image of "two figures finally visible."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Maren's agency—from discovery to decision—with a meaningful tightening that forecloses her invisibility; cost is legible in the chest lock turn and the shift to visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory, invisibility, purpose) emerges organically from particulars like caches and tape fragments; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of shared visibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (methodical, tactile attention); voice modulates with emotional pressure, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief, supporting subtext and advancement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("dust gathered like gray snow") is consistent and purposeful, and momentum is maintained through concise, sensory-driven sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (hidden dweller, lost memories) with fresh specificity through character and setting; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
