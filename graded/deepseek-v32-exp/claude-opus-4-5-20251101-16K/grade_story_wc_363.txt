<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., whispering into the bead). The final endurance is earned, but contradictory impulses aren't simultaneously active in the scene, capping at 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("giving away memory after memory until she was hollow"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of memory sacrifice shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric; the amber bead as a recurring object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost unmistakably legible as she trades memories. The dominant stake (reaching Lien) tightens through her repeated sacrifices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love as sacrificial weaving emerges through concrete images (loom, puzzle, bead) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative texture; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line-level craft elevates the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism, memory sacrifice, and weaving metaphor feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
