<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, and Cal's involuntary truthfulness is a defining trait that shapes the interaction. However, interiority is somewhat limited; Mira's emotional state is more told than embodied, and the final choice to ascend feels more thematic than driven by a visible internal conflict or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive is clear and coherent: Mira seeks cause of blackout, learns of sabotage and solution from Cal, and ascends with a thematic realization. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the final paragraph reconfigures the mission into a lesson about wonder) with cost implied by the city's ongoing darkness. Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail ("amber sky," "copper stairs," "nectar dusk") builds a distinct atmosphere. The tower as micro-setting pressures choice (the climb, the vault) and charges the final image of ascent. Details are filtered through Mira's goal-directed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (city's power) is signaled early. Escalation occurs via Cal's revelations, narrowing options to accessing the prototype. Cost is felt in the city's darkness, but pressure is primarily informational; the protagonist's agency in the climax is somewhat passive (receiving the solution).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in routine emerges organically through Cal's role, the riddle, and the final image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The motif of the matchbox and the tower reweights meaning at closure, though the thematic statement in the final line is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-filtered through Mira's perception. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent poetic register. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, distinguishing Cal's cryptic honesty from Mira's directness. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. High information density (e.g., "nectar dusk—that particular honey-colored hour..."). No noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Line-level craft supports closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy/sci-fi elements (lightning tower, mechanical bees) with a thematic focus on wonder. The truth-telling keeper and cryptic riddle feel fresh and integral. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, though the core problem-solution frame is familiar.</comment>
