<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her interiority is concrete (feeling "legacy's burden," her sensitive perception). The final choice to stay and listen is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the ivy tightening). However, we lack a strong on-page contradictory impulse in the scene—she is drawn forward without a palpable internal struggle between curiosity and self-preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira's investigation leads to diary discovery, which reveals danger, prompting the building's response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost (the ivy traps her, she understands the warning). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the decisive change is felt in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (ivy traps, fireplace holds diaries). The environment charges the final image ("green-wrapped dreams"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's perception. The ivy-veiled passage and ruined atrium are integral to pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's freedom/legacy) escalates through agency: her investigation triggers the building's response, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable (ivy tightening, "they would not let her go"). One meaningful tightening under the causal lens, driven by protagonist choice, forecloses escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (legacy, memory, dangerous obsession) emerges from concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Some legacies weren't meant to be carried. Some walls dreamed of never being alone again." No moralizing; subtext operates through the building's mourning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a textured, atmospheric voice ("Legacy's burden hung heavy"). Perception is filtered through Mira's sensitivity; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision (grandmother's backstory) is anchored in present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive with varied rhythm. No scaffold, loops, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The final lines land with charged specificity. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Core premise (corridor echo cartographer, walls that dream) is highly original and transformed through specific, grounded choices. The synthesis of climate shift, acoustic memory, and legacy feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, eerie climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
