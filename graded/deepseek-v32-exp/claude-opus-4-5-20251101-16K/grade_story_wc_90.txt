<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradictions are dramatized in the shadow work beat, and her final sacrifice is earned by a lifetime of pacifism and self-confrontation. The cost is visible in her ascent, and her emotional progression feels specific and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (Mira's transcendence) under a strong causal lens: her pacifism and shadow work directly enable the dimension's opening. Orientation is immediate, and the plot's because/therefore linkages are tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled ship and archive chamber pressure Mira's choice (the failing hull), while the photographs and tears are recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Mira's urgent, grief-tinted perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency: the failing ship's time pressure and her internal confrontation with hatred tighten options. The cost—her sacrifice—is legible on the page and forecloses all other paths, reweighting the stakes of mercy versus survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action and image (tears, stitching, ascent) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: mercy as a generative force, crystallized in Sera's laugh and Mira's completed shadow work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., the shadow work beat), and any elision (e.g., the dimension's mechanics) is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative language. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph's rhythm ("Sera laughed...") accelerates closure with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of SF and spiritual concepts (tears as dimensional memory, joy-altered gravity) feels inevitable in hindsight. The pacifist's inner work as the key to physical salvation is a bold, coherent risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
