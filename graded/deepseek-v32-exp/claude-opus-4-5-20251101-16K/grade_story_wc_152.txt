<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is precise and embodied; her wisdom disguised as foolishness drives her micro-choice to encode the warning, earning the final charged poise. The cost—risk of kingdom—is felt, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of the dancing flame and Mira's hummed tune. The constraint of her disregarded role shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory and eternal candle are not just vivid backdrop but constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection (whispering winds, blue shadows) reflects Mira's attentive POV and amplifies tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kingdom's fate) escalates through Mira's agency: piecing together clues forces the pivotal choice to encode the chart. Cost is unmistakable in the risk of failure and the silent urgency of the timeframe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden wisdom emerges organically from Mira's actions and the recurring motif of silence/stars; the ending's non-literal answer ("Fools... never suspected of saving kingdoms") reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, observant voice that mirrors Mira's perception. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence variety supports rhythm. No artifacts muddy causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wise-fool trope through specific embroidery and celestial coding feels inevitable. The perspective is memorable and grounded in lived detail; risk-taking (quiet, internal climax) heightens stakes.</comment>
