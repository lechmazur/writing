<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (tracing frost, retracing routes) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from a need to "burn bright" to finding luminosity in stillness is earned through accumulative pattern-work. The final stance—endurance and continuous adaptation—carries a visible cost in the scarred but resilient self. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (restless production vs. waiting) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of frost, ledger, and stars build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is immediate; structure of two shards (arrival/discovery, integration) is legible. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: "she would find herself luminous in ways that no fire could ever destroy," reconfiguring meaning through the final image of frost forming anew.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and ledger are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (artist's eye for patterns). Environment actively shapes tactics (waiting, reading frost) and supplies the key object. Spatial choreography is clear and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding purpose after trauma) is signaled early. Under accumulative lens, escalation occurs via density increase (frost patterns, ledger discovery) that deepens Vera's understanding. Agency is demonstrated in her choice to retrace routes and create "Scorched Testament." Cost is legible in her transformed art and the acceptance of continuous adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (frost, ledger, scars) without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and implication (frost as scripture, ledger as testament). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of survival, reweighting prior material via the final image of melting frost and renewed patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and apt. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, artist-filtered, with rhythmic control. No head-hopping. Diction remains within the character's lexicon; purposeful compression (e.g., "She learned to wait.") supports the accumulative drive. No dialogue present, so focus is on narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is consistent and clear, enhancing rather than obscuring. Sentence-level propulsion varies with emotional beats (e.g., short declaratives for resolution). High information density: every line advances character, setting, or theme. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (artist in retreat, found object) feels fresh through specific, grounded choices (frost patterns, smuggler's ledger). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in Charged Poise closure. Emotional truth is specific, avoiding generic templates. The core premise is transformed by lived detail and non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
