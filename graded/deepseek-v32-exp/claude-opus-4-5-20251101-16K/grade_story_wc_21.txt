<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her motivation intensifies credibly from archivist's duty to personal mission. However, the final choice (piloting to Alabama) feels more like a narrative necessity than a deeply conflicted micro-choice under pressure; the cost of her sleeplessness is stated but not fully embodied in the decisive moment, limiting the 9-band quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds; closure is a Decisive Change (piloting to Alabama) with a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of the lagoon "waiting to give up its dead." Cost is legible in her hollowed state and the weight of history. The three-week/two-week/one-week compression teaches pattern early, and the orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposeful (zeppelin's cathedral shadow, obsidian lagoon). The zeppelin as floating library pressures her choice (isolation, mobility) and the lagoon charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her archival POV (fever dream of ochre and gold).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through causal agency: breaking cipher, parley via debris, identifying perpetrators. The tightening is clear (discovery → communication → decision to act). Cost is visible in her trembling hands and hollowed state, though the peak choice lacks a palpable trade-off or narrowing of options beyond the declared mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting silenced history emerges organically through concrete particulars (diary, lagoon, debris messages). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight risk of thematic echo in "Truth was not meant to bring comfort. Truth was meant to burn," but it is anchored in character experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct with a lyrical, archival texture ("fever dream of ochre and gold," "black as grief"). Perceptual signature is consistent—noticing through an archivist's lens. No dialogue, but elision (the parley details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor artifact: "The solemn archivist had uncovered..." is a slight paraphrase loop of prior material, but it does not obscure causality. No figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical mystery, retrocognitive trapping, and floating library feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices (debris messages, civil-rights context). Some risk-taking in the speculative element heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
