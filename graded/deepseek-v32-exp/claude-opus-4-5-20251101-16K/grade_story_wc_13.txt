<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her profession and desire; her final choice to borrow time is earned by prior causality with visible cost in aging, showing embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear early; closure lands with decisive change (echoes freed) and resonant cost (aging), proven by "silver threading through her hair"; time constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (rooftop canals, giant, cavern), constraining choices via time pressure and navigation; sensory details are filtered through POV, and environment charges the final image of echoing towers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free echoes before giant wakes) escalates through Maren's agency under causal lens; cost is legible on-page in her aging; pressure tightens with each use of the pendant and time lock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and restoration emerges implicitly from events; subtext in echoes as memory; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "world remembered how to listen" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Maren's illustrator mindset; no head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure, and elision (time mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and coherent; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with climax, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes invisible creatures, time-sculpting, and echo-spirits with organic specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices; risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
