<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrator's curiosity and attachment to Mrs. Aldrich are concretely embodied through their work and weekly rituals; the final choice to believe in her existence is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting the lie and the responsibility to remember. The confrontation scene shows contradictory impulses (skepticism and longing) acting in scene, and Mrs. Aldrich's enigmatic presence is consistently rendered through specific gestures and dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; shards (initial meeting, tea sessions, discovery, confrontation) build pattern taught early; closure is a charged poise ("Will you keep believing I exist?") that reconfigures the relationship and the narrator's purpose with felt cost—the acceptance of a lie and the weight of preservation. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective (lavender and ink, rooftop garden, meteor shower) and constrains choice: the rooftop garden during the meteor shower charges the final image, and the recurring object (the seal) pressures the confrontation. The building itself functions as a micro-setting that shapes the narrator's motivation and the story's stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning the language of buildings vs. confronting truth) escalates through narrator's agency in researching the seal and confronting Mrs. Aldrich; a single meaningful tightening occurs in the confrontation, which forecloses the path of empirical truth and forces a trade-off—accepting a lie to preserve knowledge—with cost legible in the final exchange and nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, preservation, the nature of belief) emerges through concrete particulars (the seal, the meteor shower, the "agreed upon lies") without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the Sumerian word for threshold, reweighting prior material and leaving a lingering conceptual cost. Subtext operates richly in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by the narrator's architectural eye and historical sensibility; prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure (e.g., the meteor shower peak). Dialogue is spare but natural, carrying subtext, and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax; figurative language ("the sky unraveled in silver threads") is precise and purposeful, never muddying clarity. No loops, scaffold, or repetitive stems; line-level propulsion accelerates toward the charged poise without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of architectural history, supernatural mystery, and quiet character study feels inevitable in hindsight; the concept of "agreed upon lies" transforms a familiar ghost-story trope through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the reflective, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
