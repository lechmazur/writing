<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is minimal; his decision to sacrifice is straightforward without on-page contradictory impulses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (Silas diminished), causal lens holds tightly, and the philosopher's stone shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early, and the covenant renewal reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (resonance chamber) and objects (stone, music box) constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's professional bias, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming light) escalates through Silas's agency; the tethering action narrows options with visible cost (his diminishment). Pressure coheres under the causal lens, and the resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (mending what isn't torn, sacrifice for wonder) emerges from particulars without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Silas's continued work, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Silas, with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm. Voice modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., the lie's source) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("midnight unfolded like smoke given form") serves clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise blends fantasy and mundane with specific details (covenant of rust, philosopher's stone). Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in metaphysical repair heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
