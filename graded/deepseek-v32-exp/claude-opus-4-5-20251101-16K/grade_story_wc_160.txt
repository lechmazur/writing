<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict is concretely embodied (trembling hands, re‑reading schematics) and her final choice—to seek a third way—is earned by the cascading discovery of her father’s encrypted compassion. The shift from duty to harmonizing values feels inevitable because every micro‑choice under pressure reveals her hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; the emotional progression is layered and credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (envelope, adhesive, schematics, chain) narrows options and deepens stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise with clear cost (“six months of work”) and the final image of the chiming chain reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; the building’s breathing acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater‑inside‑a‑volcano is not just backdrop—it breathes, shifts, and directly pressures Mira’s engineering dilemma. Sensory details (dust, warmth, dim light) are filtered through her machinist’s perception. The surveyor’s chain functions as a micro‑setting that charges the final image, constraining choice and bearing emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. preservation) is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s agency as she decodes the envelope. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the auxiliary channel, foreclosing the quick solution with a visible cost (rebuilding half the gates). The cost is legible on the page and alters her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from the father’s schematics and the chain’s 53 links, never stated as a moral. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (“I understand water now”) that reweights prior material without tidy resolution. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, particularly in the pat‑stone‑seat moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third‑person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira’s engineer’s perception—noticing rhythms, measurements, adhesive patterns. Voice blends technical precision with lyrical warmth, modulating under pressure without head‑hopping. The whisper to the empty tiers is character‑specific and goal‑driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythmic control. Information density is high (e.g., the envelope’s adhesive tells a story in one sentence). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; the recurring “building breathed” motif is taught and pays off. Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates with Mira’s discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering detail and emotional legacy; the father’s love expressed through flood tables and a surveyor’s chain feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise—encrypted compassion—transforms a familiar duty‑vs‑legacy conflict into a specific, grounded exploration of how we encode care. Risk‑taking in structure (single scene, dense reflection) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
