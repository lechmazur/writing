<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving her actions with concrete interiority (stained fingers, bottled whisper). However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene, limiting peak emotional complexity; final choice is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with decisive change and cost legible in the library's shudder and fallen books. Orientation is immediate; frost pattern completion triggers the rupture earned by prior work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vividly rendered and constrains choice; frost patterns and letterpress micro-settings charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compressing eternity) escalates through Miriam's agency, culminating in the bottle opening with cost visible in the library's destabilization. One meaningful tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief and acceptance emerges through images like the bottled whisper and frost; subtext operates in implication. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical prose reflects Miriam's focus. No head-hopping; diction consistent with magical realism tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is controlled, e.g., "grief could be transmuted but never dissolved." No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism elements; glass orchard library and negotiable reality create a unique world. Emotional specificity in grief avoids generic templates, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
