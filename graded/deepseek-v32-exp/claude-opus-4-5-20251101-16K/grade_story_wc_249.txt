<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—grief-driven belief in entangled memories—is clear and compels her ritual. Interiority is concrete (Jonah's specific memories) and the final endurance (promising to return) is earned by prior causality with visible cost (bleeding palms, shattered heart). Slight tendency toward lyrical abstraction in emotional peaks ("auroral sorrow") prevents a higher score, but contradictory impulses (full yet shattered heart) act credibly in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis): Mira accepts the unbridgeable divide yet commits to return, with cost legible in her trembling hands and simultaneously full/shattered heart. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density toward the lagoon's manifestation. A minor causality quibble—the lagoon's responsive magic is taken as a given—slightly limits the score, but orientation is clear and the pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly specific and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (the ritual requires its properties) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (amber frequencies, luminescent moss). The auric lagoon is indispensable. Some descriptions verge on poetic generality, but the environment's active role elevates the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnecting with Jonah) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens via Mira's intensifying drumming, which drives the climax. The cost is unmistakable on the page (her palms bleed, heart "simultaneously full and shattered"). Agency is clear in her choice to continue despite the impossibility. One meaningful tightening (the lagoon's eruption) forecloses the hope of full restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and transcendent connection emerges organically from the entangled memories and ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—enduring communion across a divide—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (drumming, the fading smile). A slight explicitness in phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "impossible connections" slightly dampens the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and effective, with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature (Mira's poetic, grief-tinted observations). Voice modulates with emotional intensity. Some register drift toward elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "hush of the universe inhaling") is voice-motivated and consistent. The experimental, sound-based imagery is taught and paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vividly imagistic with strong rhythmic control. However, in peak beats, figurative language becomes dense ("auroral sorrow of almost-touching") and approaches overwriting, causing minor momentum drag. No major loops or artifacts, and sentence-level propulsion generally supports the accumulative build. The closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, specific synthesis of sci-fi entanglement and lyrical grief. The sound wave garden and drumming ritual are non-obvious, organic choices that heighten stakes and coherence. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through lived detail. Risk-taking in poetic, accumulative design pays off without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
