<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied, with earned resolution, but on-page contradictory impulses are historical rather than simultaneous in scene, capping below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost (emotional release and validation), orientation is early and clear, and the accumulative/textural lens holds consistently, driving the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and vial function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image; sensory details are selective and vivid, deeply integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her "screaming tenderness"; stakes tighten meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme is earned through particulars, but the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("The quietest calls carry furthest...") acts as a thematic echo, deducting for overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the cork release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse realism with magical scent-based beckoning; concept feels inevitable and risks a quiet, accumulative structure that pays off.</comment>
