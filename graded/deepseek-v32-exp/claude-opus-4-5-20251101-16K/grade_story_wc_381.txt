<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong, single-minded characterization with clear motivation and embodied emotion; lacks contradictory impulses, but final victory earned with visible cost (spent talisman, physical stiffness).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands with cost (wing faded, vigil ended); prophecy hushed, sleeper undisturbed, resonant reconfiguration achieved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nocturnal brook setting is integral to method and final image; sensory details (starlight, whisper, stones) filtered through POV; environment charges closure with lingering peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes clear (prevent awakening); escalation via accumulation of silence; protagonist agency drives hush; cost legible in spent talisman and dawn arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as powerful incantation emerges from concrete actions; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in quiet vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person POV; distinct perceptual signature (mapping silence, noticing absences); rhythmic control matches tranquil blaze tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished prose with high information density; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught; no loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of summoner, silence magic, and coded prophecy; specific details (origami wing, mapped silence) feel organic; quiet risk-taking in accumulative structure.</comment>
