<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren's weariness and stubbornness are embodied and drive micro-choices; her final revitalization of the lens is earned by prior causality with visible cost—her own exhaustion transformed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with cost legible in "the stillness had stopped running. And so had she." Orientation clear early, no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: impossible spaces and the Hall of Unfinished Stories pressure Maren's actions and mirror internal states with selective, vivid detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: weakening distress signals compel Maren to act; cost is her weariness transformed, foreclosing passive retirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rest and mending emerges through particulars; ending offers a non-literal answer via the repaired lens and chased stillness, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent, e.g., "like a held breath finally released," with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the lens revitalization.</comment>
