<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from skeptic to independent woman is earned through concrete interiority and micro-choices; the final decision to forgive and walk forward is motivated by the cascade of revealed memories, with visible cost in the weight of truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from shell discovery to garden ritual is clear; closure lands with on-page cost as she speaks her truth and chooses independence, the lens holds, and the time constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet garden and resonance structures are vividly specific, constraining action and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding her past to break isolation) escalate through memory revelations and the dawn deadline; Mira's agency in pressing the shell to each crystal drives the escalation, with cost legible in her forgiveness and resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus independence emerges organically from images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's choice and the garden's waiting crystals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical prose that reflects Mira's perception; no head-hopping, and the voice maintains a consistent, haunting texture throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and vivid, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates the ritual without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of quarantined memories and resonance structures is fresh and fully integrated; the synthesis feels inevitable, and emotional specificity avoids cliché, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
