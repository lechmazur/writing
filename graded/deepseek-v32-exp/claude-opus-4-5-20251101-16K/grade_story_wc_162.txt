<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation to understand her father intensifies under pressure, leading to an earned renunciation with visible cost in the final threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "fractured hush" and the decision to build her own mazes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prism terrace and wooden desk function as micro-settings that pressure choice and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Maren's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake escalates through Maren's investigative agency; a single meaningful deepening (decoding the logbook) forces a trade-off with cost legible in her relinquishment of the search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and necessary distances emerges organically from images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; lyrical voice with a consistent perceptual signature ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"); purposeful compression supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with no loops or artifacts; poetic diction and varied syntax propel the mood; figurative language is coherent and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (corn maze architect, drifting terrace, pilot logbook) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
