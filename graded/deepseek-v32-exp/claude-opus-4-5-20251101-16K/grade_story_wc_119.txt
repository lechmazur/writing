<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's interior contradiction between espionage and accidental prophecy is concretely embodied; her final endurance as lighthouse keeper is earned by prior causality with visible cost in isolation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise ("The keeper of lights casts no shadow") with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent lighthouse metaphor shapes the final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its beam function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei Lin's professional bias, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between cold espionage and warm hope) tightens through accumulative density; escalation is driven by Mei Lin's agency in writing fortunes, with cost legible in her realization and endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of duality emerges from particulars (fortunes, lighthouse beam) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through the final fortune and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping or register drift, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("cold river of espionage and the warm tide of ordinary hope") is consistent and clear, propelling momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes espionage with fortune-cookie writing in a non-obvious, organic way; risk-taking in reflective, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
