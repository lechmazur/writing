<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orin's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in past muteness, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned with visible cost, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in trembling hands and winter silence. Orientation is early, and the accumulative lens holds throughout, with the iceberg fragment as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the Whispering Bluff and kinetic sculpture constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposefully filtered through Orin's POV, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of preserving wonder escalate through Orin's agency in tuning the sculpture, resolving dissonance. Cost is legible in the effort and seasonal muteness, tightening under the accumulative lens with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus efficiency emerges through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the sculptures speaking for amazement, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature focused on resonance and sound. Voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing post-verbal communication with artistic preservation of wonder. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable.</comment>
