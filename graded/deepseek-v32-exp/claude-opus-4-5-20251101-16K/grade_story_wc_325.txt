<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia and determination are embodied through concrete sensation and micro-choices under pressure (counting rungs, shallow breath). Her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is consistent and intensifies with the rising tide, culminating in an earned endurance. The final stance is a credible Earned Stasis, though the early label "contradiction she'd never resolved" leans slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, building pressure through sensory density and the tidal clock. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: "The ocean exhaled behind her, reclaiming its forgotten station." Orientation is immediate; causality is tight, with the tide forcing a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice at every turn—the tidal timetable, flooding corridors, and rusted hatch all pressure Mira's actions. The environment charges the final image of reclamation. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional perception (signal ghosts, electromagnetic residue).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover recordings before tide returns) is signaled early and escalates through the seeping water and detector's scream. Mira's agency drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible as water reaches her ankles and the facility drowns. A single meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening to the forgotten emerges organically through the codex, recordings, and Mira's gift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the final line ("Because the forgotten still spoke...") verges on explicit. Subtext operates in images like the gold-flecked names and the crashing hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, atmospheric voice that reflects Mira's professional attention to invisible signals. Perception is consistently filtered through her bias (tracking electromagnetic residue). No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure is assured.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid figurative language ("walls seemed to breathe inward"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; information density is high. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates with the rising tide, supporting closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes claustrophobic exploration, undersea cables, and archival recovery into a fresh, inevitable whole. Specificity (gold-flecked codex, tidal phase transitions) avoids template plots. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
