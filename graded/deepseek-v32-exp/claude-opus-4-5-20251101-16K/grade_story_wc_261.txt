<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation and interior contradiction are clear and embodied, particularly in her realization that her purpose was selfish—"To analyze was to distance." The final choice to become a conduit is earned by the preceding causality of the displaced miracle and her scar's whisper. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness ("her purpose had always been selfish, she realized") which slightly abstracts an otherwise concrete epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (becoming a conduit) with felt cost in her cracking voice and tears, landing cleanly under a Causal lens (surgery → telepathy → revelation → action). The persistent constraint of the displaced miracle shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is anchored early ("Vera woke in the quiet tower at dawn").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower, ivy, and hourglass form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (the ivy tunnels, the hourglass thaws) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("meteor hush," "frosted hourglass cold to touch," "coffee rings layered like tree bark"). The environment is fully integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Vera's internal conflict between opening wounds and seeking closure) escalates meaningfully via the revelation of the displaced miracle. Protagonist agency drives the escalation—she chooses to press her palm to the wall and deliver the message. Cost is legible in her wince, cracking voice, and tears, foreclosing her prior path of distance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of displaced healing and communication emerges organically through the concrete particulars of the miracle, the ivy network, and Vera's scar. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "You opened others to heal yourself. Now open yourself to heal them." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing scars, patterns, plant speech). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with emotional pressure ("She let the tears fall... and began."). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("anesthesia wearing off in slow waves like fog"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "diagnostic self-awareness" moment, but clarity and momentum are uncompromised, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of closure seeker, displaced miracle, and plant telepathy feels fresh and organic, not checklist-driven. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. Risk-taking in the lyric, contemplative mode heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
