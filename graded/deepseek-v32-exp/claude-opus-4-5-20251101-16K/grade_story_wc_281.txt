<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism is embodied through concrete micro-choices (kissing while questioning, using her art to rebuild connection) and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses despair. The final stance—skepticism fueling faith—is earned by the somatic marker sequence and Eli's response, with cost visible in his tears and her determined promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: the telepathy pill recall forces Maya’s inventive response, and her light-painting intervention directly triggers Eli’s first coherent words. Closure is a decisive change (Eli reconnecting) with felt cost in the line “He was crying. Not the confused tears... but something deeper.” Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The geode’s “fractally precise” structure is essential to the method, and the studio’s darkness becomes a medium for revelation, shaping the climax and the hopeful rainbows on the walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnecting with Eli) tightens through Maya’s agency in devising and executing the somatic marker light painting. Escalation is causal and culminates in Eli’s whispered “I felt it,” a legible cost paid in emotional release and the promise of repeated, arduous effort tomorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (love as telepathy, body as memory) emerges through the specific fusion of light art and neurology, avoiding moralizing. The final image of “willowglass hope” and geode-scattered rainbows offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the line “love was its own kind of telepathy” leans slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to light, pattern, and structured emotion. Syntax modulates from reflective to urgent during the painting sequence without losing cohesion. The voice’s poetic precision (“fractally precise echoes”) remains character-bound to Maya’s artist-scientist mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffolding loops. Figurative language (“hope—fragile as willowglass”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Minor purple risk in “fractally precise echoes” is offset by its thematic integration and closure payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of near‑future telepathy failure, somatic neurology, and light‑painting art feels organic and inevitable. The muscovite geode is an irreplaceable object that transforms the climax. Emotional specificity and risk‑taking (lyric neurology) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
