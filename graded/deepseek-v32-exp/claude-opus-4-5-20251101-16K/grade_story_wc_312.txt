<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's "earnest naivety" and "brittle devotion" are concretely embodied through micro-choices under pressure, and her final decision to continue is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the ongoing test of her hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—"her brittle devotion would be tested through months, perhaps years"—and the causal lens holds tightly from study to rebuilding to the water's stir.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope through patient, small acts emerges from particulars like the dripping rates and mended bell, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer—the water stirring—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental restoration through a "lukewarm mage" subverts fantasy tropes; specific, grounded choices in dripping rates and brittle devotion make the outcome feel inevitable.</comment>
