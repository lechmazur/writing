<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is richly embodied, with Vera's grim optimism driving every choice; the final step is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens; closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) and felt cost at the rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is both vivid micro-setting and existential constraint; it actively pressures choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Vera's mathematical agency; the rupture's discovery tightens options and delivers a legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and implication; the ending reweights the staircase from prison to question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, mathematically lyrical, and strictly focalized through Vera's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive; no loops or figurative muddle, with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes mathematical precision and emotional regret into a fresh, inevitable whole.</comment>
