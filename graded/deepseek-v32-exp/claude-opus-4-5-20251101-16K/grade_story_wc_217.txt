<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation rooted in past grief is concretely embodied; her micro-choice to give the feather reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure, and the final stasis is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the girl's shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the girl's acceptance and Maren's realization, anchored early and paid off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the lagoon, feather, and kite charging the final image; the feather as micro-setting reweights meaning, though environmental constraint on choice is subtle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in brokenness) escalates via the kite's break, a pattern break under accumulative lens; Maren's agency in response deepens stakes with legible cost in the girl's emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (feather, kite, woven dawns) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via image and implication, avoiding thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, and dialogue (girl's cry) feels natural and goal-driven within the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, even in peak beats like the feather's description and final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of finding beauty in incompleteness is synthesized with fresh specificity through character and concrete details; risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off with inevitable hindsight.</comment>
