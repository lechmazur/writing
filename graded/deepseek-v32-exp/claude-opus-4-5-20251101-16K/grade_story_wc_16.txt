<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sera's ambition and regret are embodied in concrete micro-choices; Cassius's weathered hesitation and final "try" are earned by prior causality with visible cost in the three-hour deadline. Their internal contradictions act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost: the final note hangs, waiting for vows within the three-hour window. Causal lens holds tightly from Sera's recklessness to the interconnected promises, and the time constraint persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The archive and glass ink well are not just vivid backdrops; the ink well constrains the vow ritual and charges the final image with its glow, while the archive's shadows pressure the reunion. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Sera's three promises and Cassius's conditional vows tighten the stakes through the rising symphony. Cost is unmistakable in the dwindling time and emotional risk, foreclosing easy reconciliation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust and redemption emerges organically from the Veridian mechanics and the characters' specific promises, avoiding moralizing. The ending image—"teaching a dead tongue to sing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Sera, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "spines of dead languages, each tome a tombstone." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Cassius's clipped responses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("trapped tears") is consistent and clear. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating with the symphony's rise, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic magic and interpersonal repair feels inevitable and fresh; the "symphonies of truth" premise is transformed through specific vows and cost. Risk-taking in the quiet, hopeful closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
