<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her sharp-eyed trait enables the decoding, but interior contradiction is minimal; her final choice to leave the chip is earned and carries visible cost, though the emotional arc is more alignment than conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with legible cost (leaving the chip) and the sphere's constraint shapes the entire discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory disables drones and supplies the armillary sphere, directly constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details ("brilliant dimness," tarnished metal) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging) are signaled early; escalation via pattern recognition and sphere manipulation is driven by Mira's agency; cost is unmistakable in her leaving the chip, though the trade-off is positive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as a coordinate emerges through the chip, sphere, and pilgrim flowers; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (sharing the chip) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature (drone pilot's precision meets poetic observation); voice is consistent, and elision (e.g., the pilgrim's identity) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("star trails burned their ancient paths") is precise and advances atmosphere; sentence-level propulsion matches the accumulative revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and ancient astronomy; the concept of "frequency of belonging" as stellar coordinate feels inevitable in hindsight; quiet risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
