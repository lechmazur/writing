<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable's monthly "molting" is a vivid, character-specific contradiction that drives her need for constancy in the library. Her micro-choice to place the protest poems is a clear value hierarchy revealing her core motivation. Marcus serves as a stabilizing secondary pressure, but his characterization is slightly functional compared to Sable's depth. The final stance of "someone who believes in reconstruction" is earned by prior beats, though the cost of her shifting selves is more stated than viscerally felt in the closure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through imagery and reflective fragments toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate and vivid. The closure unit—the final paragraph's image of carrying "fractured light forward" and the library waiting—reconfigures the act of rebuilding from practical to profoundly symbolic, with the conceptual cost of endless, unfinished labor legible on the page. The pattern of decay and renewal is taught early and pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library is not just atmosphere; it actively constrains and enables the protagonists' choices (salvaging, tarping) and charges the final image as a "sanctuary built from wreckage." Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Sable's poetic perception ("oxidizing into burnt orange pillars"). The setting evolves from a ruined place to a conceptual space of resistance, fully integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving witness/beauty against societal collapse) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a deepening: from physical rebuilding to the symbolic act of planting "seeds" of poetry, tightening the protagonists' commitment. The cost is the endless, repetitive nature of the work, felt in the final lines. Agency rests in Sable's choice to disseminate poems and in their joint vow to continue, foreclosing the option of surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (resistance as persistent, creative reconstruction) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the false-bottom tin, the "TAKE ONE LEAVE ONE" box, the act of securing a tarp. Subtext is rich in gestures like Marcus's "reverent" movements. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "fractures will let in the light," reweighting decay as potential without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single, stable POV with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, metaphor-driven ("shedding selves the way trees shed leaves") yet grounded in concrete detail. Voice modulates purposefully from descriptive to reflective. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, revealing history and stabilizing their bond. The elision of their past is anchored in the present cue of sorting books and tilts their current stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and largely propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting emerges in adjacent metaphoric restatements (e.g., "wounded cathedral of books" followed closely by "gathering place for the dispossessed...sanctuary built from wreckage"), creating a slight echo that softens impact but does not obscure closure. Information density is high; every sentence advances character, setting, or theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ruined library, a poet with shifting selves, and a "blooming resistance" feels fresh and organic. The conventional trope of post-apocalyptic rebuilding is transformed through a specific, lyrical focus on micro-acts of witness and the monthly metamorphosis of the self. The core premise commits fully to its implications, finding originality in emotional specificity and a non-obvious, quiet form of defiance.</comment>
