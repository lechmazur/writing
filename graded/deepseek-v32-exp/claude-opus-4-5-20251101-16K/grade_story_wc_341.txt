<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and dedication, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, such as the warm telescope despite the cold, showing her connection to her father. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her isolation and vigil. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are shown through specific perceptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout, with closure as Conceptual Repricing: the sky remembers love, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when). Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Mira's vigil and the final classification "loved." Persistent constraint of her father's disappearance shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details (brass fittings, cold, starlight) and tightly integrated with character perception. The sky gondola and brass telescope function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Environment mirrors internal states, such as clouds reflecting emotion. Specificity is purposeful and supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving empty spaces remember) escalates through accumulative density of imagery and reflection, driven by Mira's agency in observation and recording. Cost is legible in her whispered commitment and the final classification. Under the textural lens, a single meaningful deepening reweights the stake with emotional price. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory, grief, and love are explored through cloud categorization and Mira's vigil. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "love... never truly scatters," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's poetic, professional notice of clouds. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining rhythmic control without head-hopping. No dialogue, but interiority is filtered through her bias and lexicon. Purposeful compression supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story, character, and atmosphere in every sentence. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity remains intact even in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with smooth propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise—categorizing clouds by emotion as memorial—is fresh and transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric structure. Originality lies in the integration of meteorology with grief and memory, avoiding tropes and offering authentic vision.</comment>
