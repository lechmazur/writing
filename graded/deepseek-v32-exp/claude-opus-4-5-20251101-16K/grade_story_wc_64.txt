<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's blithe, patient nature is concrete and consistent, driving her to decode the tapestry; her final choice to map the secrets is earned by her established traits, though internal conflict is minimal, keeping the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maren's understanding shifts and she commits to a new "game"; causal chain from discovery to decoding is clear under an accumulative lens, with cost legible in the "new weight" she carries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (cobalt silo, velveteen gloom) build atmosphere; the tapestry and silo function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image of mapping secrets under starlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on uncovering hidden truths; escalation occurs through decoding the tapestry, tightening pressure under an accumulative lens; agency rests in Maren's decision to map the secrets, with cost in her newly felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening to the dead's echoes emerges organically through the sovereign case, tapestry, and final realization; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's lyrical perception; voice is distinct ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") with rhythmic control and no head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language; no loops, scaffolding, or artifacts that obscure clarity; high information density and propulsion, especially in the decoding and final mapping beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a cemetery gardener decoding a tapestry‑encoded puzzle; concept feels organic and inevitable, with specific, non‑obvious details (chess clock, sovereign case) that avoid template plots.</comment>
