<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's motivation as an eclectic pacifist is clear and evolves through embodied emotion; her final forgiveness is earned by the journey through cataloged silences, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (tears, forgiveness) under an accumulative/textural lens; the locked diary and silences shape tactics, and orientation is clear early with no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (workshop under stars, oscilloscopes) and charges the final image when Vera tucks the diary close; the diary as micro-setting constrains choice and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her mother) escalates through accumulated silences, driven by Vera's agency in tuning frequencies; cost is legible in her emotional release and forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges from concrete silences and Vera's realization, but the final line borders on thematic statement, though it remains integrated and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature focused on silences and frequencies; voice is consistent, lyrical, and modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm, high information density, and no artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise of collecting silences via machines is transformed through specific character detail and emotional truth; synthesis feels inevitable and risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
