<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Yara's motivation is clear and rooted in her affliction and grandmother's teachings; interiority is concrete with embodied stress ("throat tightened," "pressure beneath her sternum"). Contradictory impulses (scholarly skepticism vs. youthful superstition) act in scene, and her final choice to draw the rune is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the shedding of crystal and the new, chosen scar. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from start to closure; orientation is anchored within 120 words (floating rock, Yara, tea ceremony). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost: the crystal sheds, leaving a self-etched rune, and the final image reweights prior material ("shedding was not about losing, but about choosing what remained"). Cost is legible in the transformation and the storm's break, and the persistent constraint of crystallization shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (amber clouds, petrichor, violet lightning) and functions as micro-setting: the tea ceremony platform isolates Yara, and the crow quill constrains her choice. Sensory details reflect POV urgency, and the environment charges the final image—the quill and platform are essential to the act. No generic placeholder; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming scars) is signaled early and tightens through Yara's agency under accumulative pressure. Escalation is driven by her decision to revisit superstitions and draw the rune, with unmistakable cost—the shedding of crystal and the permanent etching. No coincidence; the held breath timeframe and approaching storm increase tension coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: scars as stories, shedding as choice. Subtext operates in grandmother's voice and the rune's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing ("shedding was not about losing, but about choosing what remained"), reweighting prior material through the transformed scar and Yara's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, introspective, and filtered through Yara's stress. Voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., "saturated hush" to storm break). No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure supports closure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "Between them: this breath") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear ("crystal sang," "like ice releasing its grip"). No register drift or template cadence; closure image is sharp. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural acceleration and breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes magic, scars, and ceremony with fresh specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices (e.g., crystallizing stress, crow quill as tool). Emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
