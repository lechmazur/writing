<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. belief) act in scene; her final choice to ask for "new maps" is earned by the tooth and conversation with visible cost in the "bone setting" shift. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (Maren's shift from skeptic to seeker) with felt cost legible in the "cleft in her certainty" now seen as a doorway. The persistent constraint of the cleft shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (maze, secret garden) pressures choice and charges the final image; sensory details (cold tooth, moonflowers, perfume) are filtered through Maren's POV and integrate with action. The garden as micro-setting alters tactics and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maren's agency: finding the body draws her to the maze; meeting the changeling deepens stakes; the tooth forces a reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable in the painful "realignment" of belief. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness, stories as maps) emerges from particulars (tooth, garden, rituals) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "new maps" and the garden "remembering and becoming."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue carries subtext and character distinction (changeling's shrewd innocence). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("bone setting") is coherent and heightens pressure. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density high without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with emotional realism; specific details (substitute body, baby tooth) ground the premise. Risk-taking in quiet, conversational climax pays off with inevitable feeling. Transformation through character specificity.</comment>
