<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grandmother Sora's insurgent history and plant-speaker trait are concretely embodied; her final choice to unseal the amber is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the artifact's dissolution). No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and contradiction is shown through her troubled dialogue with the lichen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: because she carries the amber and decodes the prophecy, she unseals it at the springs. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (the fossilized embryo dissolves, releasing genetic memory to the earth). Orientation is immediate; the kite prophecy provides a constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are essential, not decorative: they fulfill the prophecy's condition and supply the mineral-rich water that dissolves the amber. Sensory details (sulfur-stained path, steaming pools) are filtered through Sora's perception and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition versus hoarded destiny) escalates through Sora's agency: finding the kite prophecy confirms her role, forcing the climactic unsealing. Cost is legible in the amber's dissolution and the release of genetic memory to the earth, foreclosing the old regime's control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of choice versus imposed destiny emerges through action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the past is given to the earth, allowing everyone to choose which traditions to carry forward. No moralizing; subtext operates in plant whispers and the kite's script.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Sora's perceptual signature (plant whispers, aged joints). Voice is poetic yet controlled; dialogue with plants feels natural within the world. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythmically, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Figurative language is purposeful ("cracked open like a ripe fruit"); no mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density advances story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and genetic memory subverts the chosen-one trope. Risk-taking with plant dialogue heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise—destiny as hoarded genetic memory—is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
