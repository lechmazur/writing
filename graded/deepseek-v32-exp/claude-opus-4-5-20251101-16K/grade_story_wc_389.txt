<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and rooted in her visionary solitude, with micro-choices under pressure (changing her broadcasts, descending the mountain) revealing a credible hierarchy of values. The final renunciation feels earned, though some emotional beats are rendered through lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through resonant imagery to a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. Mira’s realization ("shaping a new dawn never meant controlling it") reweights the premise with a felt cost legible in her departure and the final scattered light. The pattern is taught early and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory and cobalt glass portico are vividly specific and function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira’s POV, with the portico’s transformation of light serving as a recurring, pressure-bearing object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—control versus release of her prophetic message—escalates cleanly through Mira’s agency as factions form and she shifts to broadcasting raw static. The cost is visible in her relinquishment of the observatory and her isolated role, tightening options meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between curated prophecy and interpreted noise, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The final image of "scattered radio signals finding their home" reweights prior material without moralizing, offering complex ambiguity about legacy and control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The single, close-third POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical-prophetic perceptual signature that mirrors Mira’s vocation. The voice modulates under pressure (e.g., the gritty laugh) and any elision (the fragmented transmissions) is taught and paid off, maintaining coherence and rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. There is a slight risk of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "flower made of thunder"), but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image, which remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lonely prophet, fragmented radio signals, and theological factionalism feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and setting, and the risk of a quiet, conceptual closure pays off with ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
