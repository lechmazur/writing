<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's heartbeat counting and porcelain shard embody her obsessive interiority and contradictory impulses under pressure; her motivation to fetch wisdom from failure drives credible endurance, with cost legible in the final charged poise. Father's fragmented presence adds relational crucible without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Mira's ritual actions advance via because/therefore linkages to a charged poise closure where the cost of her unresolved identity is felt in the returning static and heartbeat count. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal observatory and snow create isolating atmosphere that pressures Mira's retreat; micro-settings like the ink plate and porcelain shard constrain choice and charge the final image with prismatic shadows, integrating sensory detail through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding failure and identity—escalates through Mira's agency in defragmenting the ghost, with each ink message tightening options; cost is visible in her heartbeat counts and the foreclosed path of correcting her death certificate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges through concrete particulars (porcelain shard, digital ghost) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the unresolved question "Was it worth it?" that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Mira's perceptual signature in obsessive counting and lyrical compression; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and minimal dialogue carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, and closure image is undulled by any line-level debt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost, death certificate error, and alchemical ink ritual feels organic and inevitable; specific details transform tropes through emotional truth and risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
