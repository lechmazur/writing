<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and motive-driven, with embodied interiority and a credible endurance earned by her history. The contradiction between her need to communicate and her inability to speak aloud is dramatized through encoding, though the final choice is more stasis than change, keeping it below the 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost in Mira's ghostly persistence and the caretaker's potential awakening. The flower press bolt plate as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the misty courtyard and flower press bolt plate actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated into Mira's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (communication/legacy) escalates through Mira's agency in encoding the spiral, deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her enduring ghostly state and the effort of encoding, though the conflict remains quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voiceless articulation emerges organically through encoded graffiti and Mira's history, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the courtyard's silent song. No moralizing; subtext is rich in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and compression are controlled, and purposeful elision (e.g., "driftingly alert") is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is masterful with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story, artistic legacy, and encoded communication feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed.</comment>
