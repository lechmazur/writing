<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia and motivation are concrete and drive high-stakes choices; interior contradiction ("prudently adventurous") is shown under pressure. The final choice is earned by prior causality (studying blueprints, using the compass) with visible cost (grief, defiance). Slight abstraction in "wistful rebellion" prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a decisive change (retrieves key, escapes) with felt cost (grief for father, defiance against the church). The persistent constraint of spatial mutiny shapes every tactic, and the final image of the key and compass reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the church's "spatial mutiny" directly constrains choice and escalates pressure. Sensory details ("starlight fell through shattered windows, painting silver equations on stone") are filtered through Maren's professional perception. The compass point and key function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve key/truth) escalates through Maren's agency under causal lens: playing the organ to "transfix" space creates a live, timed pressure. Cost is legible in her claustrophobic panic and the building's predatory reassertion. One meaningful tightening (the hour limit) forecloses options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (quiet rebellion, inheritance of grief/discovery) emerges through specific events and images—father's compass, the key, the organ's notes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of five roads and the key, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("claustrophobic explorer by nature"). Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and purposeful elision (father's fate) is paid off. No head-hopping; the lyrical quality is consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm; information density is high (e.g., "The space began to transfix itself"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor register elevation ("wistful rebellion") is brief and does not obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of spatial mutiny, architectural mystery, and personal grief feels fresh and organic. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (compass as key, organ as stabilizer). Risk-taking in the magical-realist concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
