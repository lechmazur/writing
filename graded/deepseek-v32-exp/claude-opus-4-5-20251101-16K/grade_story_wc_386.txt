<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "salvage something pure" is clear, rooted in her dual vocation, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final choice to carve truth into ice rather than seek human vindication. Her interiority is concrete and particular ("borrowed light, she thought"), and her cautious truth-weaving is embodied in her method and the tangible cost of her renunciation. The ghost Elsa is also distinct, transforming from a "hungry patience" to a child's smile, a change earned by Mira's actions. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, but the final endurance is credible and scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): Mira renounces public exposure to inscribe truth into the glacier, a decisive change with felt cost (the permanent, solitary act of carving). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure tightens via the accumulation of dream evidence and the emotional weight of Elsa's plea, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the stake from human justice to eternal memory. Orientation is immediate and clear; causality from investigation to choice is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacial shrine and the melted snow globe are not just vivid postcards; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The shrine's "blue ice held centuries of silence" provides the medium for Mira's lasting act. The snow globe is handled, examined, and finally lifted as a symbol of purity "despite damage," its warped glass directly mirroring the thematic core. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mira's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing Elsa's name and granting her peace—is signaled early and escalates through Mira's revealed investigation and the ghost's desperate question. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via the revelation of dream evidence, tightening Mira's options. Her agency is central: she makes the conscious choice to "tell the ice," a renunciation that forecloses a path (public vindication) with a visible, on-page cost (the solitary, permanent carving). The cost is legible in the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the "borrowed light," the melted snow globe, and the glacier's memory weave a resonant exploration of truth, guilt, and legacy. The ending offers a non-literal, profound answer: purity can be salvaged through enduring art/nature, not transient human judgment. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image (the cracking ice, the flaring candles). No moralizing; the final reconfiguration carries conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and deeply attuned to Mira's perceptual signature—her thoughts are interwoven with professional and poetic observation ("borrowed light," "borrowed starlight"). The voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue (with the ghost) is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext. No head-hopping; elision (the two-week investigation) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences do multiple jobs: "The shrine was carved into the glacier's heart, where blue ice held centuries of silence" anchors setting, tone, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The closure image ("Mira began to carve") is clear and potent. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream-analysis forensic is fresh and specific. The central conceit—using "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" to trace truth—is ingeniously integrated into the plot mechanics. The melted snow globe as a key object is a memorable, non-obvious choice. The story commits fully to its lyric, melancholic vision without gimmickry.</comment>
