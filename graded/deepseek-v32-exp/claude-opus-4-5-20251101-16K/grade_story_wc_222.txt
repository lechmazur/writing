<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mira's guilt and redemption are embodied in specific choices; her internal conflict between thief's arrogance and chivalrous code drives micro-choices like offering the sundial lid. Final transformation to "become the compass" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her committed service.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change: Mira becomes an apprentice of wonder tasked to "point the lost toward home." Causal lens holds tightly via because/therefore linkages from theft to penance; cost is legible in her offered secrets and new role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire and pocket sundial lid constrain choice and charge the final image; sensory details like "frost that caught light like scattered diamonds" are woven through action, pressuring the ritual exchange and resonating at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forgiveness escalates through Mira's agency: her offer of secrets triggers the emissary's response, tightening options and imposing cost. The final reweighting—"be the compass"—is driven by her choice and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus possession emerges through concrete actions and dialogue; subtext in the chess game and the emissary's message ("become one") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice; Mira's perception filters setting and dialogue naturally. Rhythmic control under pressure, as in "wind chimes in a hurricane," heightens emotional beats without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and precise imagery; no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language like "sky was wrong" supports clarity and momentum throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chivalrous thief and apprentice of wonder feels inevitable; specific details like chess-piece exchange and pocket sundial lid transform tropes through character-driven stakes, risking lyrical tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
