<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia and painterly determination are concretely embodied; her choice to exchange the brooch reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning the final peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: her sleep and realization charge the prior convergence; causal linkages from trails to brooch to exchange hold tightly under a hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal island pressures time and discovery; the brooch's unearthing and the rain trails' convergence constrain choice and charge the final image with specific, sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency—following trails, finding, exchanging—each beat narrowing options toward a cost-legible renunciation that reweights her artistic purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of convergence emerges from the brooch's dual symbolism and the exchange; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights war and peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; voice carries a distinct perceptual signature ("time moved differently... rhythm of waters") and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops; figurative language ("thresh meaning," "haggard awe") serves clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war setting, tidal environment, and artistic meaning-threshing; the convergence concept feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
