<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skimmer's non-human interiority is rendered with concrete, patient observation, and its final Earned Stasis—accepting its purpose as keeper—is credibly motivated by centuries of learning and the arrowhead's revelation. The cost of eternal stillness is palpable, though its agency is more observational than active, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the skimmer's realization of its calling reweights centuries of vigil with palpable cost. The arrowhead discovery acts as the decisive deepening, and the final image ("hummed its eternal, patient song") lands with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the canyon and bone towers constrain the skimmer's very nature and charge the final image. Sensory detail ("dust dance," "echoes linger") is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the skimmer's resonant perception, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through layered observation, tightening decisively at the arrowhead's appraisal. The dominant stake (purpose/understanding) deepens, and the cost—the skimmer's eternal binding—is legible in the final peace, foreclosing the path of physical movement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (stillness vs. motion, sacred duty) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the birds' patterns, the arrowhead, the bone towers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the posed question without moralizing, reweighting the entire narrative through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is a distinct, meditative perceptual signature, tightly aligned with the skimmer's consciousness. Poetic compression and rhythmic control are consistent and purposeful, with no head-hopping. The elision of centuries is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and flawlessly controlled. Sentences vary in rhythm to match contemplative pace; there are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Information density is high, with each line advancing character, atmosphere, or theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—a harmonic entity learning navigation through bird patterns in a bone-canyon—is original, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (non-human protagonist, quiet plot) heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
