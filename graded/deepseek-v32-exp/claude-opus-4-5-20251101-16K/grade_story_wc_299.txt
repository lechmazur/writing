<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and contradictory (trembling hands vs. factual appraisal). His final choice to call Jimmy is earned by the cloth's discovery and his reflective struggle, with cost visible in the wind's echo and his vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of the cloth against his chest and the quarry's echoing wind. Orientation is immediate and anchors the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and wind function as micro-setting that pressures choice and charges the final image. Sensory details (dust motes, limestone pit) are selective and filtered through Marcus's professional and emotional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates via protagonist agency: the cloth forces a choice between appraisal and feeling. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional risk of the phone call and the relinquishment of insulating facts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (speaker cloth, wind as applause). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—purpose as bridging moments—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that matches Marcus's appraiser mindset. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; the wind metaphor is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no artifact loops. Figurative language (wind as distant crowds) is coherent and heightens closure. Information density is high, advancing character and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-roadie and antiques appraiser, with specific, irreplaceable details (speaker cloth, quarry setting). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; the closure reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
