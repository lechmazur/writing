<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion shown through micro-choices like trembling hands. Her final decision to descend is earned by prior causality—the fever, discovery of the hidden message—and carries visible cost in seventeen years of waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens; Mira's descent after discovering "Forgive" reweights prior material with felt cost in the final image. The lens holds, and orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Mira's POV; the weather station and botanical illustration constrain choices and charge the final descent. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency in smudging the illustration, deepening knowledge under the accumulative lens. The cost of swallowed truths is legible on-page in her decision to leave after seventeen years, foreclosing her life at the station.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the painting and auroral light, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with poetic compression reflecting Mira's perceptual signature; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. Single POV is stable, and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weather forecasting with personal truth; specific details like "fault-tolerant oracle" and risk-taking in lyrical structure heighten stakes. The transformation feels inevitable, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
