<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure (confession, breaking bread) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her motivation—penance through noticing—intensifies credibly, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in actions like touching the bread's crust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "tenuous thread of absolution strengthen." Orientation is anchored early (Vera, palace courtyard, tea house). Persistent constraint of erasure shapes tactics and the final image of planting jasmine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective (aroma of ancient bread, wind in guerrilla garden), filtered through Vera's POV. The bread as object charges the final image, and the tea house setting constrains choice by enabling hidden remembrance. Economy is purposeful; no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remembrance vs. erasure) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase: bread revelation, confession, shared gathering. Protagonist agency drives tightening; cost is legible in Vera's uncloaking and the broken bread. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (sacred in ordinary, tenuous absolution) emerges organically from particulars like the bread and guerrilla gardening. Subtext operates in gesture (bread crumbs as relics). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "quiet unmaking of erasure, one seed at a time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV (Vera's) is stable with distinct perceptual signature as a "noticer." Voice is lyrical yet controlled; dialogue feels natural and goal-driven (Emil's quest). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats, such as Vera closing her eyes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("guerrilla garden," "tenuous thread") is precise and voice-motivated. No overwriting; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory preservation in a dystopian frame, transformed through specific details (300-year-old sourdough, guerrilla gardening). Emotional truth in Vera's guilt and penance feels authentic. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective stakes heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
