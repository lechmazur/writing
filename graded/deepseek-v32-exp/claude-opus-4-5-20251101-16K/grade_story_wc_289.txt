<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's interiority is concrete and her motivation—searching for the thread that connects all things—is clear and intensifies. Her final choice (writing a letter for herself) is earned by the visitor's revelation and her prior causality, with a visible cost in her transformed stance from ghostwriter to participant. The "inevitably whimsical" trait is shown in her handling of the nest but is a minor note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: Mei's realization and act reweight the premise of connection, with cost legible in the final image of her letter catching light. The lens holds throughout; the pattern of letters, nest, and installation coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Lotus Temple and lily pond are vividly integrated as a micro-setting that pressures choices (inspires the installation) and decisively charges the final reflected image. The thrush's nest functions as a recurring object that constrains choice and appears in the closure, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the thread) escalates through accumulative density—the installation, the visitor's revelation—culminating in Mei's agency-driven realization and action. The cost is felt in the reconfiguration of her understanding and her personal participation at the spiral's edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection through silence and the thread of wanting emerges powerfully from particulars (letters, nest, installation). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The visitor's dialogue verges on thematic echo but is grounded in specific memory, slightly tempering the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical, observant perceptual signature. Prose rhythm matches the contemplative tone; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., "prismatic quiet") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and purposeful imagery. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Some lush density exists but does not obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of love-letter ghostwriter, thrush's nest, and public art installation feels fresh, organic, and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids templates; the perspective on universal fragments of love is non-obvious and fully committed.</comment>
