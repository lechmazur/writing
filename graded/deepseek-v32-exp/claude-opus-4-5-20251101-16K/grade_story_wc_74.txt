<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia and dedication are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her final realization that her work memorializes kindness is earned by prior causality with visible cost (three years of sleeplessness). Interiority is specific and avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (her paintings reconfigure as monuments to kindness) with felt cost on the page ("three years of painting lost languages"). Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city pressure choices (moonlight positioning, refuge from pollution) and charge the final image; the brush functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory of kindness) escalates via the daydream that reconfigures Mira's understanding; agency is in her painting and realization, with cost legible in her sleepless endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from particulars (brush, paintings, old woman's gift); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—paintings as proof that "kindness rippled outward"—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("saffron threads dissolving in warm milk"); lyrical voice remains stable and heightens pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the quiet intensity of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment>A fresh synthesis of insomniac painter, lost languages, and moon-tipped brush feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
