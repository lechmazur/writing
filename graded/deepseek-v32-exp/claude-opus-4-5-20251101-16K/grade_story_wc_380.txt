<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find deleted memories is concrete, rooted in her mother's forgetting, and compels her investigative actions. Interiority is embodied through professional rituals (lantern lighting, coffee reading) and micro-choices under the strange gravity. The final resolve to exhume and read memories back is an Earned Stasis that forecloses passive acceptance, cost felt in the likely lack of recognition. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic moment ("Mira understood now") but it's brief and anchored in the discovered object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held cleanly: patterns of gravity, memory, salt, and light build to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost—the realization that deleted memories become "heavier than forgetting" and sink into preservative chambers, reconfiguring Mira's quest from search to recovery. Orientation is immediate and clear. The whale's beaching as inciting incident and the journal's discovery create a coherent, taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional: the harbor, lighthouse, and salt crystal chamber are vivid, sensory, and deeply integrated. The chamber is not just described but functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (guiding via gravity fluctuations) and decisively charges the final image and thematic resonance. Details are filtered through Mira's professional and personal priorities, creating a cohesive, lived-in atmosphere that is essential to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering lost memories) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through Mira's agency: reading grounds, following gravity, exhuming the journal. Each step deepens knowledge and narrows the path. The cost is legible in her resolve to continue despite the emotional price of her mother's non-recognition. One meaningful tightening (discovery of the journal and its revelation) is sufficient and well-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and preservation emerges organically through concrete particulars—the whale, gravity pockets, crystals, the journal. Subtext operates in image and implication (e.g., "lanterns... a small defiance against forgetting"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the harbor holding its "gleaming silence," reweighting the premise without moralizing. The pressed wildflowers shift meaning from mere memento to recovered artifact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that matches Mira's worldview. The prose texture—measured, precise, slightly archaic—coheres and modulates effectively with emotional beats. No head-hopping or distance issues. The voice supports the accumulative, textured drive of the story and remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and vivid imagery. Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward repetitive lyrical motifs ("gleaming silence" appears twice) which, while tonally consistent, edges toward decorative patterning in a high-pressure beat. No significant loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels fresh and inevitable: the conjunction of whale beaching, gravity anomalies, memory physics, and salt-crystal preservation is specific, grounded, and transforms its magical realism tropes through lived detail. The core premise commits fully and follows its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky.</comment>
