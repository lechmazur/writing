<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verai's motivation is crystal clear and rooted in her lineage and grief; her interior contradiction (sadness versus determination) is embodied in her actions, such as weeping over the untranslatable word for dawn. The final choice to press the diamond to her own arm is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her isolation and the language's death. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through concrete, sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly from start to closure. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph (Verai on the bone tower, canyon setting). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diamond's flaw becomes a doorway for translation, with cost legible in the language's death and Verai's enduring effort; the echo "didn't return" but joined the eternal song, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting—bone towers, canyon echoes—is not merely vivid but actively constrains and enables Verai's method; the canyon's echoes become an instrument she harnesses. The flawed diamond functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image: its crack forms a "tunnel of echoes" and ultimately transmits translations, essential to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Verai's agency: she translates textures across seasons, with pressure tightening as the language dies. The decisive act of pressing the diamond to her own arm produces a sound that joins the canyon's song, foreclosing other paths with visible cost (her isolation, the language's loss). Cost is unmistakable on the page in her weeping and the grandchildren's inability to understand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: language death and preservation through texture and echo. Subtext operates in the diamond's curse and the birds' patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the language lives in echoes, heard by travelers as colors and textures—without moralizing, reweighting prior material with poignant cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Verai) is stable and finely controlled; voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "copper veins glinting beneath her translucent skin"). Rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (time jumps across seasons) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., "the canyon had been singing since before the first word was spoken"). Information density is high; every line advances character, setting, or stakes. No artifacts obscure clarity, even in peak beats like the final transmission.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique synthesis: translating texture into sound to preserve a dying language, with elements like bone towers, flawed diamond, and bird patterns feeling organic and indispensable. The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on language death, and risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
