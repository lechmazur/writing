<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in her obsession with decoding, embodied through concrete actions like tracing the telegram and adjusting the telescope. Her final choice to find others is earned by the dream revelation and carries the visible cost of Oren's solitary burden. However, internal contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, keeping the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Vera realizes healing requires community, reweighting Oren's death and her own mission. The causal lens holds tightly from decoding to dream to dawn insight, with cost legible in "Oren's absence as something she could carry—not alone." Orientation is immediate, and the dream transition is legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—copper dome, brass instruments, daylily-pressed telegram—and filters through Vera's scholarly POV. The telegram as a recurring object charges the final image with reweighted meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is purposeful, avoiding generic cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding to understand/heal) escalates through Vera's agency: her stellar decoding triggers the dream, where speaking syllables redistributes burdens. The cost of solitary obsession is felt in Oren's fate and her exhausted revelation. One meaningful tightening—from solitary breakthrough to communal purpose—lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the decoded inscriptions, the dream healing, and Vera's final commitment. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carrying absence "alongside every soul." Subtext operates through Oren's telegram and the dreamers' silent gratitude, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—scholarly, precise, yet poetic—that filters through Vera's star-charting focus. Voice modulates seamlessly from technical observation to mystical dream without register drift. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent and character-specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("breathing darkness," "shadow-child") is controlled and purposeful. Sentence variety supports propulsion, and the final lines achieve resonant compression without muddle or artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of variable-star astronomy, lucid dreaming, and ancient healing rituals is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Originality lies in the specific integration of these elements through character-driven decoding and a community-focused resolution. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
