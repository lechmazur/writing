<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her rejection of her father's violence. Her internal conflict (drawing then sheathing the blade) and micro-choices (weaving the ballast, teaching) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final stance—enduring commitment to cultivation—is earned by prior causality. Slight deduction for some labeled interiority ("senselessly perceptive") but overall strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with conceptual cost: Mira's quiet rebellion against entropy, weaving continuity through teaching and the ballast scrap. Orientation is clear early; structure is a single scene with integrated flashback. The cost is legible in the final image of growing "what deserved to outlast her."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the glass dome creates a "tranquil blaze" that pressures and protects. The desert rose farm and the ballast scrap (object-as-setting) constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's perception, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's pacifist cultivation versus a fallen world—signaled early and tightens with the stranger's arrival. Escalation is driven by her agency: she weaves the ballast scrap and teaches her method, foreclosing violence. Cost is legible in her vulnerability and the ongoing effort to "weave continuity through chaos."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (cultivation vs. destruction, continuity vs. chaos) emerges organically through concrete actions and images—the ballast scrap, the roses, the teaching. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (e.g., sheathing the blade).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice that mirrors Mira's perceptive nature. Prose rhythm is controlled, and perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction, but voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or grammatical issues. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative pattern and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a bounty hunter's pacifist daughter cultivating roses in a post-apocalyptic dome. The ballast scrap transforms from memory to symbol. The quiet, reflective plot takes risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
