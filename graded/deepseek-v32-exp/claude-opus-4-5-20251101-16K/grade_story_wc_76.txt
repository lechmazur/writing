<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, but internal contradiction is not deeply explored in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure lands with on-page cost in the reconfiguration of the prophecy. The hunger stone schematic and yoyo mechanics create a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice via tide timing and lighthouse architecture; the hunger stone and yoyo act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying fate) escalates through Maren's agency under the causal lens; initiation of the sequence tightens options with visible cost in her transformation. Pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like backward clocks and latent radiance; subtext is rich in implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Maren's professional bias. Rhythmic control supports pressure, and purposeful compression integrates backstory without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic variation; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and clear, and line-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes backward time, prophecy, and latent radiance with fresh specificity; tropes are transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in metaphysical twist heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
