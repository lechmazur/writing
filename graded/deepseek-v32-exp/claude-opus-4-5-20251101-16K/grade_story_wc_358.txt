<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in professional dedication; interiority is concrete via embodied actions like gripping the ladder and reflecting on the patch. However, internal contradiction is subtle, and the final choice—translating chaos into data—is earned but with more conceptual than personal cost, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise ("this time, someone would be watching"), cost is legible in the system's "relentless optimization," and the causal lens holds tightly from investigation to insight. Orientation is immediate, and the structure's single-scene progression feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice—wind channels cause the accident and shape Mira's survey. Sensory details (wind's moan, gray light) are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of "secret channels" with atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing future accidents) escalates through Mira's agency: climbing, measuring, discovering the convergence. Under the causal lens, each beat narrows options, and the cost—systemic negligence—is unmistakable on the page in the "relentless optimization" line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: wind physics, the patch, and the port's efficiency trade-offs. Subtext operates through irony and image, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about foresight vs. variables, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's professional-perceptual signature—noticing wind patterns, technical details, and thematic echoes. Voice is precise yet lyrical, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("invisible rivers," "singing through the gaps"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; line-level craft supports momentum and closure with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of accident investigation with wind physics and systemic critique feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (anemometer, configuration logs, flight engineer patch) ground the premise, and risk-taking in subject matter heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
