<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses (hatred vs. buried love) are dramatized in scene; her final surrender of the music box is earned by the cellular memory revelation with visible cost. Vera's scheming pacifism is integrated through choice-driven turns. Minor risk of therapy-speak in Vera's dialogue is offset by embodied sensation in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira's goal (forget) meets Vera's intervention (release), leading to a decisive change with cost—leaving the music box as a grave marker. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; closure lands with a felt price in the final image, and the sanctuary's soundless constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is both atmosphere and constraint, forcing internal confrontation; the music box as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details (cheap soap, hum) are filtered through Mira's memory and reweight the stake. Environment actively narrows options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional freedom vs. resentment) escalates through Vera's cellular memory revelation, which narrows Mira's options. Cost is legible in the surrender of the music box. Agency rests with Mira's acceptance of the memories, driving a meaningful tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resentment and grace emerges through concrete images (broken pin, melody in blood) rather than statement. Final line reweights prior material without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in Vera's explicit explanation ("I exist to teach resentment...") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical but controlled prose that reflects Mira's perceptual bias. Telepathic dialogue advances plot and subtext. Voice maintains rhythmic variety and specificity under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., opening line sets character, conflict, symbol). No scaffold, loops, or figurative muddle; rhythm accelerates with emotional beats. Information density supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and psychological healing, with a fresh take on the guide archetype (scheming pacifist). The sanctuary's soundless constraint and cellular memory mechanic are organically integrated, committing fully to the premise and heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
