<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alex's affectionate skepticism is consistently embodied, driving his initial doubt and subsequent determined action. Internal conflict between skepticism and care is shown through micro-choices like retrieving the geode after the shock. The final choice to create the light painting is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the effort and fragile hope. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the captured image symbolizing fragile hope, cost legible in "willowglass hope." Causal lens holds strong from pill intake to light painting. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the static shock constrains tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio actively constrains choices and supplies resources, shaping Alex's method. Sensory details like "air still humming" and geode's "soft, inner glow" are selective and purposeful. The studio charges the final image, with spatial choreography coherent during the light painting sequence. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating Mara's pathways) escalates through Alex's agency under the causal lens, from retrieving the geode to devising somatic markers. Cost is unmistakable in the effort and time pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the light painting translates mental maps, foreclosing other options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection against fading memory emerges organically through events like the geode's reprise and light painting as neural pathways. Subtext operates in gestures and the final image, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. The "willowglass hope" reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering details through Alex's skepticism and care. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "fractally precise attention" reflecting his method. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; "whisper in a crowded room" enhances clarity. Minor ornament in "willowglass hope" but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy pill, somatic markers, and light painting feels inevitable, transforming memory loss tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in blending sci-fi with emotional depth heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
