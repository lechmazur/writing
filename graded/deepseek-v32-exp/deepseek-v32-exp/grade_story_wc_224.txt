<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final renunciation of substituted realities is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting painful memories. The hierarchy of values is revealed through micro-choices like tracing the feather.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "the painful remembering softened into acceptance." The drive lens holds, and orientation is anchored early. The lost language stone's revelation reweights options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices and charges the final image as a self-built sanctuary. Sensory details like "mercury-glass" and "feather's vanes felt like silk" are selective and POV-filtered. The mountain's shifting shelves pressure Elara's journey inward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency, with density increasing through nightly stone sessions. Cost is unmistakable in her facing painful memories to heal. The dominant stake (understanding home) tightens through a meaningful deepening that forecloses escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with home redefined as a pattern of connections through the stone's revelations. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, resonant in the image of the mountain bookstore with Elara at its center. Subtext operates in imagery like the labyrinth as metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression, like "hidden thunder," is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift; internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor repetition in "seed" phrasing occurs. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of seer and bookstore tropes through specific details like the mercury-glass and feather. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere.</comment>
