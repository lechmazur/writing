<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully through doubt and renewed trust, driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; cost is legible in ghost's sacrifice, though Jax's skepticism resolves quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hope and trust emerges organically from events; final image "The garden grows" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior despair.</comment>
