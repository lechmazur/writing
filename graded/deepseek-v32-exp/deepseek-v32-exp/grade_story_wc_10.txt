<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions shown through heat-mapping. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, and the resolution, while earned, leans on summary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—silence becomes her instrument—under the Accumulative lens. The lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in the final image of the heat-mapped tapestry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choices (heat-mapping on glass) and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. Specificity is purposeful, enhancing atmosphere and supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in heat-mapping, tightening emotional stakes toward closure. Cost is legible in her transformation, but the internal focus limits external pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to transforming trauma without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gestures and the heat-map, with the final image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic and consistent—elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity, though dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Minor figurative language in peak beats is coherent and voice-motivated, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of silence and music, transformed through specific details like heat-mapping. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
