<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her balanced curiosity is shown through micro-choices, like expanding her teaching method, which earns the final realization. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from teaching to student engagement. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ocean becomes a launchpad, with felt cost in the somber marvel. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the benthic city and Astral Chamber constraining choices by making starlight navigation vital. Sensory details are purposeful, and the environment charges the final image of the ocean as a launchpad.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is understanding navigation post-alien contact, escalating through Elara's agency in adapting her teaching. Cost is legible in Kael's engagement and her somber marvel, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events, with subtext in the chain link and starlight symbolizing reconnection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is clear and purposeful, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of benthic city, alien contact, and starlight navigation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
