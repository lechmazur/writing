<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to clear her name is clear and consistent, driving her investigation. Her interiority is shown through concrete actions like examining tickets, but emotions could be more embodied under pressure. The resolution with Marco feels earned, though her emotional arc is somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal chain with clear closure: mistrust thaws through Elara's actions and Marco's confession. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the shared understanding and renewed trust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vividly described with sensory details (rain, whispers) that constrain choice by enabling eavesdropping. It charges the final image of harmony, integrating setting with plot and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes of mistrust escalate through Elara's agency in investigating tickets and projecting images. A meaningful tightening occurs when Marco confesses, with cost visible in their emotional relief. Driven by causal lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transparency emerges through events like the lens's ambiguous clarity and the projected doodles, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the forecourt as a place of peace, though slightly explicit in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's observations. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when Marco speaks. No head-hopping, but prose could have more rhythmic variation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with good information density, though minor redundancies exist (e.g., "ambiguously clear" repeated). No major artifacts affect closure; sentence rhythm supports momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept of eavesdropping on environmental whispers and using doodles is fresh, synthesizing elements organically. Tropes are transformed through specific details, but it lacks bold risk-taking for higher bands.</comment>
