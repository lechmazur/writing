<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like healing in moonlight. The final change is earned by prior causality, though "quantified sorrow" leans slightly abstract, reducing immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (sorrow dissolving into mundane miracles) under an accumulative lens; the pin sound catalyzes a shift, and orientation is clear early. Lens holds without ambiguity, but the pin's role feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the stormlit tower and moonlight pressure Elara's actions, with sensory details like "stones gleaming" integrated into POV. The environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (sorrow) escalates through protagonist agency in mapping dreams and using the sextant; cost is legible as sorrow dissolves, though the pin's introduction is a minor coincidental complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's realization. No moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like touching the oak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is clear in Elara's noticing. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., dream mechanics) is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency issues exist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control with no major artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor scaffold in "quantified sorrow" phrasing, but no loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize freshly—labyrinth worker, sextant, dreams—with specificity that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
