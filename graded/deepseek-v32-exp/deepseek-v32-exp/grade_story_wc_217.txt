<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete is clear and consistent, driving his actions such as picking up the feather and reframing the kite incident. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his values. The final choice to weave the moment into poetry is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his fulfillment and the child's eased sadness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting incompleteness as beauty with felt cost in the shared moment and the poet's renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with details layering toward resonance. Orientation is clear early, and the kite snap incites a meaningful tightening that deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like the cobalt lagoon and wet sand are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the poet's POV. The drake's tail feather constrains choice by inspiring his actions and charges the final image as a talisman, integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the accumulative lens, as the snapped kite string introduces discord he harmonizes, narrowing options and deepening the stake. Cost is legible in the child's transformed sadness and the poet's reflective fulfillment, though the internal stake limits external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the fallen kite and feather, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to beauty in incompleteness without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery and action, such as the poet's exchange with the child, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the poet's attentiveness. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot through subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax that propels momentum. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "burnished hush" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of finding beauty in incompleteness is fresh and synthesized through specific character and setting, avoiding tropes. Execution is organic, but while memorable, it lacks transformative risk-taking for higher bands.</comment>
