<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in letting go of the shell. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens with coherent causality from the mirror crack to the cave discovery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the shell's release. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details filtered through POV. The coastal cave network and painted seashell constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating seamlessly with character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and dominant, escalating through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. The discovery in the cave tightens options, and the cost of letting go is legible on the page in the heart unburdened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the shell's release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
