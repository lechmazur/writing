<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with his resilient positivity anchoring his actions, but internal contradiction is minimal, and emotions lack deep embodiment under pressure, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (ferry materializes) and implied cost in "permanent transient beauty"; causal and accumulative hybrid lens holds strong, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spectral grotto and starlight are vividly specific and constrain choices, as the hourglass uses environmental features to align patterns, charging the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Eli's agency with the radio and hourglass, narrowing options under the hybrid lens, but cost remains somewhat abstract despite legible tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience and interconnection emerges organically through images like the "permanent transient" grotto, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic flourishes; radio dialogue advances plot naturally, though minor register consistency issues arise in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density with no major loops, but phrases like "permanent transient beauty" risk metaphorical muddle without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of vanishing ferry and timelines is executed with specificity and risk in pattern-based resolution, feeling organic rather than derivative, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
