<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices under pressure. Her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as roots aching and pain guiding her. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in scars and tears. Contradictory impulses like anxious elation act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—roots transforming into bridges—and felt cost in the glade's relief. The causal lens holds tightly, with events linked through Elara's actions like using the clipping. Orientation is clear early, and the eclipsed covenant's restoration shapes tactics. Persistent constraints (roots) charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is vividly rendered with sensory details that pressure choices, such as roots binding Elara and the glade responding to her actions. The setting constrains tactics and charges the final image through the clipping's dissolution. Sensory selection reflects urgency, with cobalt hues deepening as shadows stretch. Micro-setting elements like the maze topiary alter outcomes, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, using the clipping and linking through scars to narrow options. The dominant stake (restoring the covenant) tightens with visible cost in blood and tears. Pressure coheres until the final act, where a trade-off forecloses paths. Cost is legible in the transformation, though minor abstraction in "anxious elation" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as scars representing healing and balance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by embracing scars rather than stating a moral. Subtext operates in gestures like the clipping dissolving into starlight. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding platitudes, but slight repetition in tone holds it back from 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's root-bound perspective. Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with rhythmic syntax enhancing atmosphere. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction remains within character lexicon. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but the quick test is met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without major loops. Figurative language is purposeful but slightly dense in phrases like "anxious elation," causing minor overwriting. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with clarity in key beats. No artifacts harm closure, but figurative stacking in high-pressure moments triggers a small deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—root-bound visionary, eclipsed covenant, linking through scars—feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity anchors universals, with the glade and clipping transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious integration and charged closure image satisfy the 9+ test.</comment>
