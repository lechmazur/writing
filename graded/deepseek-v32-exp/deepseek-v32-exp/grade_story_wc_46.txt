<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to share the light is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving solitude, and contradictory impulses (solitude vs. connection) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page ("weighing that decision felt like holding the entire ocean"), and the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of solitude shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the serpentine grotto and sea glass constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through polishing and memories, leading to a decision with legible cost. However, the pressure coheres but lacks multiple distinct beats, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of light without fire, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with lyrical rhythm and controlled diction. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency holds it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slight overwriting in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of familiar themes, with specific details and risk-taking in the quiet, introspective narrative. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and transformation avoids derivative patterns.</comment>
