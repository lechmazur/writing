<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing stars and using the lantern glass. His change from yearning to acceptance is earned, though lacks strong contradictory impulses. The final realization carries cost, aligning with his spiritual curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Kael's acceptance forecloses his path of doubt with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens coherence ensures the ending lands with undeniable pressure, e.g., "Kael smiled, knowing he was part of something vast and beautiful."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the station and yellow glass acting as micro-settings that charge the final image. Specific details like the dome and glass constrain Kael's choices indirectly by enabling his actions, though not overwhelmingly. Atmosphere supports theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in Kael's empathy and reflections, driven by his agency. Cost is legible in his realization of vulnerability as strength, but external conflict is minimal, limiting higher band entry. One meaningful tightening occurs through his active tracing of stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the yellow glass and star tracing, with subtext in imagery and avoidance of moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through Kael's acceptance, reweighting prior material without explicit statement. Minor overtness in concept mentions prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., reflective passages) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; internal coherence remains under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and variation, though minor overwriting in repetitive phrases like "flourishing stillness" is purposeful and not artifact-heavy. Information density is high, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Closure image remains clear and uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise of cosmic janitor offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, but lacks bold structural choices. Originality feels inevitable but not exceptionally innovative.</comment>
