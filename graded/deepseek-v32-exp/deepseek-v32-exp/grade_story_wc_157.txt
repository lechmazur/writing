<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's defiance is clear and consistent, driving key choices under pressure, but interiority lacks deep contradictory impulses; her final resolve is earned yet feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the escape and strengthened resolve, under a causal lens; orientation is sharp early, and the tax enforcement constraint shapes tactics, though the warp resolution leans slightly on convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting is vividly sensory and actively constrains choices through warping plants and insect chaos; it charges the final image with thematic resonance, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, with enforcers' arrival forcing a tactical response; cost is legible in the risk and dispersal, though the dissonance solution slightly simplifies pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges organically from botanical cipher and defiance; the final line "smallest seed can shake an empire" verges on moralizing but remains character-specific and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with dialogue natural and goal-driven; perceptual signature sharp under pressure, and elision (e.g., warping) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion, though minor overwriting ("converging chaos") and a template cadence in action beats slightly dull clarity; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously blends thought tax with botanical ciphers for a fresh, specific synthesis; risks in concept heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
