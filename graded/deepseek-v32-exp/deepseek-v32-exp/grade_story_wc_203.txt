<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority shown through his observant nature and embodied emotions. His decision to engage the ghost and help them find peace is earned by prior causality, with the "weightless burden" reflecting a credible endurance. However, his competence borders on one-dimensional, lacking significant internal contradiction or struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with clear orientation early, and closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost—the ghosts fade after Leo's promise, reconfiguring his purpose. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the persistent constraint of his ghost-seeing ability shapes tactics. Minor convenience in the ghost's appearance is mitigated by motivation from the mainspring barrel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like the buzzing light and dust patterns, constraining choices as Leo uses the environment to uncover secrets. The abandoned circus ticket office pressures tactics and charges the final image, with micro-setting elements like the ceiling crack reinforcing theme. No generic or static description harms momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of helping ghosts find peace escalates under the causal lens through Leo's agency, from discovering the barrel to engaging spirits. Cost is legible in his time spent and the "weightless burden" transformed to pride. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghosts materialize, forcing a deeper engagement, though escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and mending the past emerges organically from events and images, such as the cracks in the façade and the mainspring barrel. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, theme occasionally verges on explicit in lines like "mended more than elevators," slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Leo's observant profession. Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue with the ghost feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful, as with the silence after the buzz, teaching patterns paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, such as "silence felt heavier," and figurative language is coherent. Read-aloud test passes with varied openings and propulsion, though minor redundancy in "weightless burden" repetition does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes ghost-seeing with repair work in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like dust analysis. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in supernatural elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the premise echoes familiar haunted-past narratives, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
