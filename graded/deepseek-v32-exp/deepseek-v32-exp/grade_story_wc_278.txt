<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion shown in moments like her weeping. Her final choice to use tattooing skills on soundboards is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible when guilt transforms into a "dull ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as guilt is acknowledged and released, with felt cost in the "weight lift." The causal drive lens holds tightly, linking her actions to resolution, and time folding adds persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the laboratory and amber constraining choices and charging the final image of "constellation tattoos glowing softly." Sensory details like "meteor hush" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, such as integrating the amber and tattooing soundboards, with cost legible when she weeps upon understanding the cry. Stakes tighten meaningfully from guilt to redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption emerges organically through images like the amber and tattoos, with a resonant, non-literal answer in "understanding its song." Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and elision (e.g., time folds) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "meteor hush" is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending tattoo artistry with sound redemption. Specific details like haunted firmware and amber transform familiar tropes through character-driven choices.</comment>
