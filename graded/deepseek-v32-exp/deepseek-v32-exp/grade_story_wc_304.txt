<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but lacks internal conflict or flaws, limiting depth. Her competence is unwavering, with no contradictory impulses under pressure, though her actions align with her goal. The final choice is earned, but cost is more conceptual than personally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara captures the spark, defying oblivion with legible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and structure is a single, coherent scene with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the skyborne grotto and aurora integral to the method and atmosphere. The aurora's static patterns constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV, enhancing tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (capturing the spark before oblivion) and escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increase in focus and infusion. Agency drives the escalation, with cost legible in the success against fading essence. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving beauty against oblivion emerges organically through actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("beauty could echo beyond silence") without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature reflecting Elara's focus on patterns. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, enhancing emotional pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with varied rhythm, clarity, and high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "drinking in the spark like a parched root." No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; propulsion is strong throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is original, blending fantasy and mortician themes with specific, grounded details. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyrical structure heighten stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through character and setting.</comment>
