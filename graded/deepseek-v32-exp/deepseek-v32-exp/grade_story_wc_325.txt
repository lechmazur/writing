<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and motivation to stand by the unremembered are consistently embodied and drive micro-choices under pressure, such as focusing on researchers' faces to overcome fear. The final choice to return the codex is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the tidal deadline. However, some emotional descriptions lean slightly toward summary, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara returns the codex, triggering the researchers' gratitude and her escape, with felt cost in the imminent tidal shift. The causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages, and the tidal constraint persistently shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, such as phase transitions forcing careful navigation and the codex's gold fleck revealing pathways. Sensory details like the "crashing hush" and sparking cables are selective and purposeful, charging the final image where the facility calms. The environment functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Elara's agency, as phase transitions and time pressure narrow options, with cost legible in the risk of eternal transition. The dominant stake (returning the codex before tides seal her in) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, though the escalation relies slightly on environmental hazards rather than deeper moral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through concrete actions and images, such as the codex's return reweighting Elara's personal healing, without moralizing. Subtext operates in her embodied fear and duty, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the researchers' ghostly gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's claustrophobia and perceptual bias, with a distinct voice in phrases like "crashing hush." Rhythm and diction control under pressure are strong, but the absence of dialogue limits subtext exploration, and some descriptive passages slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story efficiently, but minor overwriting occurs in repeated "crashing hush" and slightly stacked modifiers in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure causality, and closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements like phase transitions and undersea cables feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the surreal environment heightening stakes. Specificity in the codex's gold fleck and Elara's claustrophobia avoids template plots, though the core premise echoes familiar exploration tropes without full transformation.</comment>
