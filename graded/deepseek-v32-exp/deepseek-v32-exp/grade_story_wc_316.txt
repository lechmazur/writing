<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (emotional breakthrough and history stabilizing) under a causal lens; cost is legible in Kael's spark of feeling. Orientation is clear early, and structure tightens through Rin's guidance and the custody debate.</comment>
