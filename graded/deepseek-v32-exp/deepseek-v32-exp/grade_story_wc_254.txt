<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices, but lacks internal contradiction or struggle, reducing depth; final transformation is earned through paraphrasing action, with cost legible in the thawing lake and lingering doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (ban based on fear, lake thaws) and persistent constraint (boundaries) shapes tactics; orientation is clear early, and paraphrasing causes dissolution logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with cobalt atrium and quartz colonnade actively constraining choice (pillars as key to dissolution) and charging the final image (lake thawing); details are woven into action and reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (paraphrasing tightens options and dissolves boundaries); cost is unmistakable in the tremor of certainty and thawing lake, foreclosing paths with visible conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in change emerges organically from events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the poet's transformation and carried hush; no moralizing, but slight explicitness in "he understood" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping or elision issues; rhythmic control supports pressure, though dialogue is absent and voice remains consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "lantern-moth hush" is purposeful and clear; no artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentences advance story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (forbidden place, transformation) with fresh, specific elements (paraphrasing as action, quartz colonnade); turns feel earned and inevitable, with risk in lyric tone, but not highly innovative.</comment>
