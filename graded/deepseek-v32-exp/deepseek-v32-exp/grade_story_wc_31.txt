<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the transformation, while earned, lacks deep conflict; the vow feels slightly tidy without significant struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias vows to protect the knowledge, felt cost in his expanded purpose. Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from motivation to discovery. Orientation is anchored early, and the key unlock signifies a persistent constraint shaping the finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "scent of salt and decay" and the luminous pathway, constraining choices as the library and key direct action. The sunken ship micro-setting charges the final image, though some descriptions edge toward ornamentation without full integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in discovering sound's color escalates under causal lens through Elias's agency—diving, unlocking—with cost legible in his vow. One meaningful tightening occurs at the orb's revelation, narrowing options and foreclosing his prior solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sensory truth emerges from particulars like the luminous vows and color manifestation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in vows "hiding behind truth," but abstraction slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a poetic perceptual signature, though voice can become overly ornate under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, but rhythmic control occasionally wavers in dense passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, advancing story with minimal scaffolds. Minor overwriting in phrases like "meteor hush" risks muddle, but no loops or artifacts harm closure; propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lamplighter and sunken library with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like the key and orb. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
