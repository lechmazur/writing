<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as breathing into stiffness during a freeze. Her motivation to anchor optimism in realism drives consistent actions, and the final integration of memory is earned by prior causality. Minor use of diagnostic language ("somatic markers") is mitigated by dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara releases grief's grip, cost legible in her whispered ritual. Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong via sensory density and pattern shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lighthouse beam persistently constraints the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filters through Elara's POV, with the arboretum and cliff edge constraining choices by mirroring resilience. Sensory details (brine, blooms) are purposeful, and the environment charges the closure by symbolizing integrated growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between memory and healing) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase when aircraft hum triggers somatic response. Protagonist agency drives tightening through breathing and grafting, with cost visible in her refusal to let paralysis win.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like grafting and the photograph, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to optimism/realism tension without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (lighthouse beam) and gestures (smoothing the photo).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, rhythmic control, and poetic diction that modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "pearl of stillness" repetition) slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of drone strike survivor, somatic healing, and arboretum sanctuary feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (grafting as transformation) avoid tropes, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
