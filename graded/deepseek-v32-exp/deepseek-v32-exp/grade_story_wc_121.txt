<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to conquer the labyrinth of self is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices like tracing runes and leaping. His final renunciation of defying gravity is earned by prior struggles with fractured selves, and the cost is visible in the painful integration. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—Kaelen merges timelines and achieves peace—with felt cost in the painful integration. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with each rune activation leading to viaduct reconfigurations. Orientation is clear early, and the structure follows a coherent cause-effect chain without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct constrains choices by reconfiguring in response to runes, charging the final image of stability. Sensory details like "rain-slicked stones" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment actively shaping tactics and mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the causal lens, with each rune activation narrowing options and increasing cost, culminating in the painful integration. The dominant stake of self-conquest is signaled early and tightens through his choices, such as rejecting the eternally young self. Cost is unmistakable in the on-page suffering during timeline merging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-integration emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in Kaelen becoming "simply Kaelen." Subtext operates in reflections and fractured selves, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without tidy resolution, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Kaelen's state under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "between the drop and the ripple") is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor purple hints in peaks like "darkening brightness" slightly reduce clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with varied syntax and concise advancement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractured timelines, procedural generation, and self-conquest feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, such as the tablet's evolving use. Emotional truth and specificity anchor the premise, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
