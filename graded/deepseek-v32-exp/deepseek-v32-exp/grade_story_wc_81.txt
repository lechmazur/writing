<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; her "dappled resolve" shows internal conflict, and her final choice to probe the cabinet is earned by prior causality. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like using the stamp in darkness, reveal character. However, some interiority edges toward summary, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—discovering fragmented scrolls—and cost is legible in her smile and redefined truth. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from hypothesis to discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the sunken library's darkness forces tactile navigation, and the stamp charges the final image. Sensory details (touch, smell) are purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins) escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency—she readjusts methods, probes the cabinet, and finds scrolls. Cost is visible in her abandonment of neat indexing for complicated truth. One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: truth versus curated history, with stillness as a tool. Subtext operates in gestures like stamping and the library's silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—Elara's perceptual signature is tranquilly perceptive, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., reliance on touch) is taught and paid off. Diction remains character-consistent, though minor expositional phrasing appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story efficiently. Minor redundancy in "reclaimed stillness" phrasing, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis: a logical indexer in a sunken library using tactile methods during a blackout. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in quiet introspection heightens stakes. Feels inevitable in hindsight, though not radically innovative.</comment>
