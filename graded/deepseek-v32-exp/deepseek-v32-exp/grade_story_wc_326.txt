<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in heartbeat counting and micro-choices during defragmentation; her change from haunted to accepting is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the frantic then calm rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as Elara stops counting heartbeats and recontextualizes the shard; the accumulative/textural lens holds via pattern coalescence in ink, and the ink method persistently constrains tactics, charging the final image of solace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the opal observatory and spilled ink filtering through Elara's POV; the ink and shard function as micro-setting, constraining choice in defragmentation and charging the ending with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake in fetching wisdom escalates through Elara's agency in defragmentation, driven by the accumulative lens; cost is legible in heartbeat acceleration and slowing, foreclosing her path of anxiety with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically through images and events, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shard's recontextualization, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elara's poetic, anxious voice; rhythmic control under pressure, and the ghost's dialogue fits the synthesized tone without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language in ink patterns is coherent and supports propulsion, and closure clarity is untouched by any muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghost and ink defragmentation feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking with abstract concepts heightens stakes through specific, grounded choices in character and closure.</comment>
