<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from start to closure. Her curiosity and protective nature are embodied through micro-choices like adjusting the hearing aid and assuring Eleanor, with no stock phrasing. The final renunciation (letting Eleanor go) is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Eleanor's peaceful dissipation, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Causal lens, cost legible in Elara's solitary calm. Orientation is immediate, pulses create because/therefore linkage, and the hearing aid's constraint shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks; structure is tight for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with mist, dome, and marble bench, filtering through Elara's POV to charge the final image. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that constrain choices and amplify stakes. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting voices) escalates through Elara's agency under the Causal lens, from tracking pulses to assuring Eleanor. One meaningful tightening occurs as the pulses intensify and the ghost appears, foreclosing options with visible cost in the emotional resolution. No coincidence; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges organically from Elara's actions and Eleanor's story, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of peace and silence, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the warming photograph, deepening emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal. Elision (e.g., pulses as guide) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences vary in structure, advancing story and atmosphere efficiently. Figurative language (e.g., "reeling hush") is consistent and purposeful, clarity untouched in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ghost story and emotional legacy. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the hearing aid, and risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
