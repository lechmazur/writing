<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and interiority, but internal conflict is summarized rather than shown simultaneously in scene. Aris's cautious hope and determination are embodied, and his final choice to interfere is earned, though some emotional beats rely on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is causal and coherent with on-page closure: the signal disruption and Evans's confrontation form a decisive change with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the causal lens holds without ambiguity. The ending reconfigures Aris's role as guardian with resilient resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "humming consoles" and "dimly lit control room" filtered through POV. The radio station constrains choice by enabling the counter-signal, but environmental pressure could be more deeply integrated into tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Aris's agency under the causal lens; his interference narrows options and incurs cost with Evans's arrival. The community's calming shows tangible impact, though the external conflict resolution is somewhat swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope versus chaos emerges organically from events and character choices, with subtext in the cosmic struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but some thematic elements are slightly explicit in narration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a professional yet gritty texture. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, but minor register consistency issues arise in Evans's lines. Perceptual signature is strong, though elision is minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied rhythm and high information density. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is controlled. Minor scaffold phrases like "wave of relief" appear but do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic and social conflict with fresh specificity; the interpreter-as-guardian angle feels inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure integrates elements cohesively.</comment>
