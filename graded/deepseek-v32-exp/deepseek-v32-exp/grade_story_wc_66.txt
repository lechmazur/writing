<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying as she decodes broadcasts and embeds codes in scores. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "pulse quickening" and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to embed codes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk of exposure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her quiet rebellion balanced with thistled calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the dust glowing and narratives flourishing, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost in the looming threat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through pattern and repetition. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with Elara's actions driving the arc. Cost is legible in the final image of the alcove breathing with stories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ember alcove and radio glow constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias. The alcove functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics, serving as a sanctuary where stories stir. No generic or static description; environment actively shapes the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving stories escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency, from listening to transcribing to embedding codes. Pressure coheres and tightens with each choice, narrowing options and increasing risk. Cost is visible in the threat of authorities and the delicate calm. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as stories as seeds scattered on the wind, without direct statement. Subtext operates in elusive lyrics and dust shapes, inviting reflection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the dust's luminosity and continued broadcasts. No moralizing; complexity lingers with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains within Elara's lexicon. Dialogue from the broadcast is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Figurative language like "thistled calm" is purposeful and coherent. Grammar and punctuation are clean, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing story famine, pirate broadcasts, and dust narratives into a fresh, non-obvious angle. Tropes are transformed through specific details like elusive lyrics and embedded codes. Risk-taking in the conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity make the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
