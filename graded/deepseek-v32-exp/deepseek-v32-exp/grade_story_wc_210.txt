<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final renunciation of magic is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict between reason and nostalgia is dramatized. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly, with closure as a decisive change—the town's revival through Elian's efforts—legible cost in the rejection of wishes. Orientation is clear early, and the amber bottle's constraint shapes tactics. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "brittle leaves" and "sagging lanterns" filtered through Elian's POV. The paper-lantern cove and amber bottle constrain choices and charge the final image, guiding the revival plan. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining civilization without magic—escalates through Elian's agency, such as gathering materials and teaching settlers, with visible cost in effort. Pressure tightens under the causal lens, foreclosing the wish-dependent path. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, like the unopened bottle symbolizing patience, without moralizing. Subtext in Elian's rejection of "false comfort" leads to a resonant, non-literal answer: a world where wishes are unnecessary. Earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet consistent voice reflecting Elian's alchemical mindset. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective, e.g., noticing "brittle leaves" and "durable reeds." Elision is purposeful, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "sagging like a forgotten dream," is purposeful and clear. Sentence propulsion supports scene needs, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic revival with alchemical reason, transforming tropes through specific details like working memory and the amber bottle. Risk-taking in theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
