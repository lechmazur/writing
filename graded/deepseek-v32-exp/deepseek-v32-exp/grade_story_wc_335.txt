<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characters exhibit embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, with Elian's shift from frustration to vulnerability earned through causal scene work. The archivist's combative tenderness and backward-walking habit reveal consistent interior contradiction. However, Elian's anger melting into defiance feels slightly abrupt, though cost is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in Elian's perception, reversing his exile through earned causality under a causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in his emotional vulnerability and the archivist's pride. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the persistent constraint of exile shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dusty floors and creaking swings, integrated into action and constraining choices through shards and tea leaves. The forgotten library charges the final image by enabling the mentorship, though the playground swing remains somewhat atmospheric rather than pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reversible exile escalates through Elian's agency in annotating shards, driven by causal linkages. Cost is legible in his trembling hand and melted defiance, narrowing options meaningfully. The archivist's guidance reinforces pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through metaphors like shards and tea leaves, with a non-literal answer at closure that exiles is perceptual. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing, though the "anger is a shield" line verges on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV (archivist) is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., swing sounds) is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "permanent slice of fading light" is purposeful, and propulsion accelerates with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "heart a mix of stern duty") but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of exile and mentorship through unique elements like shard-annotation and tea-leaf geometry. Tropes are transformed with specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
