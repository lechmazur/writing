<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her promise, with interiority shown through dreams and emotions. Her final choice to speak the decoded phrases is earned by prior causality, mending her fatigue with visible cost. However, some emotions like "shared burdens" are abstract, slightly reducing embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara decodes the inscriptions and heals herself, under a causal lens. The cost is legible when she feels warmth spreading, mending doubt. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the observatory and daylily-pressed telegram constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "stars whispered secrets" are purposeful, and the environment shapes tactics through the telescope and dreams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency, as her discoveries through variable stars tighten options and lead to healing. The cost is unmistakable when she speaks the phrases and lightens shared burdens. One meaningful deepening under the causal lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens and healing emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the manual for empathy. No moralizing; subtext operates in images like the telegram reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic and scientific registers. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision in dreams is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in repeated "midnight solace" but no major artifacts or loops that obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lucid dreams, variable stars, and healing words feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending science and spirit. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and the closure reconfigures prior material with freshness.</comment>
