<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to cultivate sparks is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with her dreamless nature serving as a vessel for the work. Her change from hollow to peaceful is earned through persistent action, though interiority sometimes leans abstract rather than fully embodied. The final peace feels credible, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as sparks ignite and Elara finds peace, under a coherent accumulative lens. The wave functions and archive shape tactics, and orientation is clear early. The chess clock symbolizes constraint but doesn't actively narrow options, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting with the glowing dune and archive constraining choices and charging the final image through its reactive light. Details are purposefully selective and integrated into action, supporting the accumulative drive without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in charming sparks, with visible cost in her draining hollowness. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the abstract nature of sparks slightly mutes visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically through images and actions, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the sparks thriving and lullaby smoothing, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control, even under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor register elevation in peaks prevents highest score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with strong propulsion and no major loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting risks in phrases like "dreamless freight guard" but clarity remains, and closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements like the divergent archive and wave functions feels inevitable and organic, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with coherence and originality.</comment>
