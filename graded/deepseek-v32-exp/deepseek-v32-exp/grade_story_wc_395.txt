<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives her actions, with her obsession compelling higher-stakes choices like lying for access. Her "brightly attentive" nature is embodied in specific details, such as zeroing in on the patch's discrepant thread. The final realization about deleted files fragments her initial quest, earning a conceptual change with visible cost. However, internal conflict could be more dramatized through contradictory impulses rather than stated obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: the numbers lead to coordinates, the patch reveals a frequency, and the lie uncovers messages. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's realization about fragmented truths reweights memory's cost, felt in the final silence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or unkept setups undermine the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored through "humming servers" and "digital ghosts," with sensory selectivity reflecting Elara's focus. The patch and numbers function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image by correlating to the broadcast frequency. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and details are integrated into action, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake in uncovering truth escalates through Elara's agency: she decodes numbers, lies for access, and confronts the cover-up, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the ending's "silence between the notes," a felt price for the revealed crime. Pressure tightens causally without coincidence, and the climax forces a trade-off between knowledge and unresolvable loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and deletion emerges organically through the cold case investigation, patch, and numbers, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by redefining deleted files as fragmented silence, charging prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gestures like the repaired thread and recurring distress code, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction ("digital ghosts") with professional lexicon. Dialogue in the lie scene is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Elision in the investigation is taught and paid off at closure, and psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats, though minor register consistency could be tighter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "ashes on the wind" is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and syntax varies naturally to support pressure, though a slight purple tinge in peaks doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital memory keeping with a space cold case feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the patch's thread and recurring numbers. Emotional truth arises from concretized loss, and the closure reconfigures the premise with ingenuity. Bold risk-taking in the poetic tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
