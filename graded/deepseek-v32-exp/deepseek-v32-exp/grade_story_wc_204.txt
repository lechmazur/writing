<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal chain leads to on-page closure with palpable cost; orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity, making the rupture and its consequences feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, with unmistakable cost in the library's destabilization; stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
