<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied through her gnarled hands and ritualistic polishing, with motivation rooted in pragmatic effort against measurable luck. Her steadfast belief drives the narrative without stock phrasing, and her final proof feels earned by prior causality, though minor lack of interior contradiction limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds strong, building through small victories to a resonant reconfiguration where the garden's response proves her point. Closure lands with cost in the polished marbles and the visitors' realization, orienting early and maintaining coherence, but a slight ambiguity in lens persistence prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden maze is vividly rendered with sensory details that pressure Elara's choices, such as vines threatening paths, and charges the final image where it breathes with her, constraining and reflecting her journey with high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of proving care over luck escalates through Elara's agency in mending deceptions and demonstrating to visitors, with cost legible in her devotion. However, escalation under the accumulative lens relies on density rather than causal tightening, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's actions and the maze's cycles, with subtext in rituals like polishing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor reliance on recurring images prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on horticultural detail, and voice remains consistent under pressure. However, minimal dialogue and occasional exposition limit the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied sentence structures, high information density, and no loops or artifacts. Minor template cadence in descriptive passages prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes measurable luck with intimate care in a fresh way, transforming tropes through specific details like cracked marbles. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes, but some elements feel slightly derivative, limiting originality.</comment>
