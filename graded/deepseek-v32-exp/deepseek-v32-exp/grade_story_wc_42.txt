<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in the "luminous ache," but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; her resolve remains changelessly constant without significant internal conflict, though micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (clock hand halted, flare captured) and resonant reconfiguration (lingering ache), cost is legible in the sorrow/joy mix; causal lens holds tightly from tremor to leaf-fall trigger, orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar observatory setting pressures choices via tremors and airlessness, with the clock as a micro-setting object constraining action and charging the final image; sensory details (leaf sound, light burst) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (capturing the ephemeral flare) escalate under causal lens through intensifying tremors and Elara's agency-driven restructuring; cost is unmistakable in the luminous ache and foreclosed transience, with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transience versus permanence emerges organically through events and images (leaf fall, escape velocity), with the ending offering a non-literal answer via the captured flare; minor explicit repetition of "luminous ache" slightly reduces resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure, though slightly over-lyrical at peaks; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, advancing story without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in climax ("camera whirred, light flooded").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (lunar camera repair, solar flare capture) with specificity; risk-taking in lyric tone pays off, though concept is not entirely groundbreaking, it feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
