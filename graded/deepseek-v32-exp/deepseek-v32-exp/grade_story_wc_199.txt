<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from curiosity to sacred duty, with interiority shown through concrete actions like prodding leaves and building monuments. The transformation "emerged transformed always" is earned by prior causality, though some emotional descriptions like "mossy delight" edge toward abstraction without full embodiment. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final duty shift has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara realizes her role as guardian, foreclosing her solitary path with felt cost in deepened duty. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the moonstone dust integrates causally. Minor hairline slip in repetitive transformation phrasing, but closure lands with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the ashen arbor and monuments constraining choices (e.g., dust transfer alters tactics) and charging the final image of greening branches. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as leaves "inscribed with cryptic symbols." The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through Elara's agency, using the moonstone dust to enhance monuments, narrowing options by binding her to the arbor's fate. Cost is legible in her transformed essence and the communal shift. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation lacks a sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection through change emerges organically from particulars like leaf decoding and monument building, with the final leaf symbol offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in whispers and visions, avoiding moralizing. Minor abstraction in "mossy delight" slightly dampens specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, e.g., "during the hush where past meets prophecy." Elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping, but slight template cadence in repeated "emerged transformed always" reduces perceptual signature under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, but minor loops in "mossy delight" and "emerged transformed always" create template cadence without payoff. Figurative language is generally coherent, and closure image remains clear. No artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skyborne arbor and folklore feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical accumulative structure. Specific details like moonstone dust and monuments transform tropes through grounded choices. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, though "mossy delight" leans slightly ornamental.</comment>
