<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in adaptive traits, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to create art instead of seek revenge is earned by prior causality, though some emotional shifts are slightly told rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost ("forged in fire") under a causal lens, and orientation is clear early. The ledger persistently constrains tactics, and the resolution is legible as a decisive change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the frost patterns acting as a micro-setting that constrains choice by guiding deciphering. The canyon atmosphere supports tone, but its impact on pressure is moderate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (survival and purpose) escalate through Elara's agency in retracing events and using the frost, with cost legible in her resolve. Under the causal lens, tightening is meaningful and driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in patterns and light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some lines edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. No head-hopping or dialogue, but voice remains coherent and purposefully compressed under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise with good information density and varied rhythm. No major artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is integrated without muddle, though minor purple phrasing occurs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of glass art, ledger, and frost patterns, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric resonance heightens stakes without gimmickry, but it's not groundbreaking.</comment>
