<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Widow's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with haunting practicality constraining emotional expression. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like carving under time pressure. Final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the transformation of pain into purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where carving reconciles here and gone. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the "rust-hued peace" image. Kettle's boil provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Loft setting with rain-beaded skylight and ash wood scent creates a vivid atmosphere that constrains choice via the kettle timer. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtering through the widow's POV to charge the final image of the carving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting lessons from loss escalates under Accumulative lens through the kettle's whistle tightening time. Protagonist agency in carving drives deepening, with cost legible in the foreclosed path of unexpressed grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of here and gone emerges through particulars like the carving crystallizing time, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the finished piece reconciling loss, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending poetic observation and practical focus. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., memory flashes) is taught and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "crystallized time" is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief processing through specific carving ritual transforms tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
