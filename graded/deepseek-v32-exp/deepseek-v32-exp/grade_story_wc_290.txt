POV filtering is consistent, with Elara's claustrophobia coloring spatial perception. The nexus and compass function as micro-settings that actively pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under the causal lens, with Elara's compass use and transcription narrowing options amid intensifying mutiny.
