<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "haunted euphoria" and micro-choices such as steeping the locket that reveal her values. The closure choice is earned by prior causality, though the repeated abstract phrase slightly dulls peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early, causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from the demolition vote to covenant regeneration, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the bittersweet triumph and pulsing locket.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like night-blooming jasmine and salt-tinged air are selective and purposeful, with the jetty constraining choices and charging the final image of eternal bloom, fulfilling the micro-setting role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the council vote, driven by Elara's agency in steeping the locket and writing, with cost legible in the "haunted euphoria" and trade-off of saving memories over physical preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the rescue and covenant, with subtext on memory's weight, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the jetty's eternal bloom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in sensory selection, and purposeful elision taught early, though minor convergence in emotional peaks with repeated "haunted euphoria."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with lyrical yet clear prose, varied rhythm, and no major artifacts; purposeful repetition of "haunted euphoria" supports tone without muddling clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist magic and memory preservation, with specific details like walnut ink and proximate causes transforming tropes through grounded choices, though some concept elements feel slightly ornamental.</comment>
