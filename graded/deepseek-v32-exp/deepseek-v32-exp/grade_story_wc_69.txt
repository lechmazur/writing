<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to use the rosette is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the rehearsal scene. However, minor abstraction in emotional summary slightly limits peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the transformation during rehearsal. The drive lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The rosette's discovery and use provide a meaningful tightening, though the plot is simple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like the "velvet library" and "crimson leaves" filtering through POV. The library and rosette constrain choices and charge the final image, elevating specificity. Economy of detail supports momentum without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of achieving harmony escalates through Elara's agency in finding and using the rosette, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the choir's transformation, but escalation lacks intense pressure, relying more on thematic deepening than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the rosette and rehearsal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though minor thematic echoing in "vanishing arts" slightly reduces freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven in the rehearsal scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and information density, with purposeful figurative language. Minor overwriting in phrases like "tiny spirits of the vanishing arts" causes slight figurative muddle, but no major artifacts or loops harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concept of "subtracting noise" for harmony is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and theme, with risk-taking in quiet resolution heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
