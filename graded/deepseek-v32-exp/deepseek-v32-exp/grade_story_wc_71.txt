<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a "noticer," driving her quest with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the house's transformation, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elara understands the pattern of displaced objects, reweighting the premise with felt cost in the house's sigh and warmth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with orientation anchored early and causality intact throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the bay and cottage constraining Elara's choice to place the orris root. The environment charges the final image through the "hushed blaze" and streetlights' glow, integrated seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in placing the displaced object, tightening the stake of understanding houses' vitality under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the house's awakening, foreclosing stagnation with a tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the orris root and displaced objects, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to renewal through small acts. Subtext operates in imagery and implication without moralizing, earned through Elara's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled rhythm, and purposeful elision in phrases like "shard of hush." No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional pressure, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "pink snow" is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting risks exist in peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of creeping normality and displaced objects, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
