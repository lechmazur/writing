<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>J-7's motivation to find thought origins is clear and intensifies, with embodied composure under stress and earned final insight through merging disparate selves, satisfying the 9+ test with contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing on the cost of courage, under accumulative/textural lens; orientation is early, and timeline amalgamation drives decisive change with felt cost in the final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin constrain choices (e.g., fragility risks) and charge the closure image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrating with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in finding thought origins escalate under accumulative lens via density increase in timelines; agency in violin use drives tightening, with cost legible in embracing fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from amalgamation events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in violin's hum and looping timelines enriches reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct robotic-poetic voice; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., noting frost glints), and elision in timelines is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "bow made of frozen light") is coherent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of robot janitor, ice violin, and timelines feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar quest tropes.</comment>
