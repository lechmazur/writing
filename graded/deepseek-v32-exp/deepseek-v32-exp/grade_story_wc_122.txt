<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to escape emotional numbness is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through actions like tracing the drum. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as using the broken needle, reveal a hierarchy of values, and her reawakening is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her tears. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elara's tears and reawakening, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the broken needle's use as a key to transformation is taught and paid off. The final image of the mirrored hush reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like sawdust and hammer taps integrated into action. The environment functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics, such as the phonograph enabling Elara's transformation. Specificity is purposeful and reflects POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, as she chooses to play the backward recordings, deepening the stake of emotional numbness. The cost is legible in her physical sensations and tears, foreclosing her path of numbness. However, the pressure coheres through density increase rather than causal tightening, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the backward songs unraveling into primal beats, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence's depth. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Kael's knowing eyes, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the filament of hush, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in Elara's sensory-focused narration. Voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in signs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language, like "a filament of hush," is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of a deaf music teacher using backward recordings to heal, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The element combination feels organic and memorable.</comment>
