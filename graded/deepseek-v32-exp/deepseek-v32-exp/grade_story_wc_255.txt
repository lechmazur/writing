<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. His final renunciation of color fixation is earned by the painting scene, with visible cost, though the "innocently cunning" trait is underutilized in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Elian accepts imperfection. Causal lens holds tightly from journey to awakening, with no orientation debt; the reed tongue's vibration marks decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the cracked fountain directs Elian's painting. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the courtyard's harmony without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sight vs. acceptance) escalates through Maestra's challenge, narrowing options. Protagonist agency in painting drives deepening, with cost legible in the inner shift and reed awakening, though one micro-turn is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the concertina's music, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Plant communication and dialogue are natural and goal-driven, though minor convergence in voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance character and atmosphere concisely; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, transforming the "awakening" concept through grounded choices. Risk-taking in plant communication heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
