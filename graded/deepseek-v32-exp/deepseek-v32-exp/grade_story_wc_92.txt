<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions under pressure. Her calmly inventive nature is demonstrated through micro-choices like decoding the sundial and distributing pamphlets. However, the lack of internal conflict or flaws slightly limits depth, though it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the revolution begins, cost legible in the risk taken. Causal lens holds strong from blackout to distribution, with the blackout as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the luminous fort and blackout pressuring choices. The quill holder and sundial act as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully integrated, reflecting Elara's priorities and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revolution escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency, from decoding to distribution. Cost is felt in the clandestine risk, narrowing options meaningfully. The blackout tightens pressure, and the resolution is earned by her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges organically through events and objects like the cradle of sparks, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. However, some motifs feel slightly over-reliant on repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic rhythm with Elara's focused perspective. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., decoding mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, with clear propulsion in key beats like the distribution. No figurative muddle or register issues in peak moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like the sentinel role and sundial cipher, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet rebellion heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept is fully committed and transformed through specific details.</comment>
