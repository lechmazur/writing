<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her scientific mindset, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final shift to humility is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in her "kindled humility," under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The orientation is clear early, and the structure builds seamlessly to the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the greenhouse and dust patterns constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (stripping drama), with escalation through accumulative observations that deepen her understanding. Agency in attention leads to a legible cost in her humility, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in dust patterns and a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; complexity is embraced through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scientific-perceptual signature that controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the final humility realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astrophysics and personal ruin feels inevitable, with specific details and risk-taking in quiet structure. Fresh angle on familiar material, though not radically transformative.</comment>
