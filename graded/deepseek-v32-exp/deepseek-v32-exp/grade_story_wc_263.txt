<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in her struggle with unspoken words. The final choice of alignment is earned through prior causality, but some interiority leans toward abstract description (e.g., "shadowed rapture") rather than contradictory impulses in scene, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the fragility of creativity and the resonant reconfiguration of alignment. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building to a charged poise. Orientation is clear early, and the orrery's role in the climax provides a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and orrery constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Elara's POV. The setting actively pressures her methods and supports the theme, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in tracing stars, leading to a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "shadowed rapture" and fragility, but the stakes remain somewhat internalized, limiting higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through celestial imagery and Elara's arc, offering a non-literal answer to creativity's connection to the cosmos. Subtext is rich in motifs like "remembered stardust," avoiding moralizing, though some phrases border on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, cosmic voice. Rhythm and diction control under pressure enhance the accumulative design, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving the theme. Minor template cadence appears in repetitive "shadowed rapture" and "unwritten calendar," but no major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial and creative elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyric mode heightening stakes. Specific details like the orrery and aurora avoid template plots, though the core premise has familiar roots.</comment>
