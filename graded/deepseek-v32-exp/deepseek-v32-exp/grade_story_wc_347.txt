<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority showing contradictory impulses (reluctance vs. duty). Her micro-choices under stress reveal values, and the shift to acceptance is earned through causality, with cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara moves from reluctance to quiet acceptance, with felt cost in "knowing she would do it all again." Causal lens holds tightly, and orientation is anchored early; the orchard's curse persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (labyrinth constraints, mechanical birds as obstacles). The nut as micro-setting constrains assembly and charges the final image, with sensory detail selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (travelers' safety) escalates under causal lens via time pressure (night frost) and mechanical birds' aggression, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and risks taken.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty and acceptance emerges organically through events and imagery, with subtext in repeated motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior reluctance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and lyrical without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in high-pressure beats maintains clarity, though minor register consistency holds it from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, even in peak beats, and syntax accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (cursed orchard, mechanical birds, blueprint) feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
