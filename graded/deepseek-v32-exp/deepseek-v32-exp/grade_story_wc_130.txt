<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in his loss, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His shift from solving to accepting loss is earned through specific on-page events, such as the projection of Lyra's face, with visible cost in his changed stance. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when Elian realizes emotion mathematics is about integration, not elimination, reconfiguring his pursuit. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns like the mosaic and drips to this realization. Orientation is clear early, and the cost is legible in the final image of peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choice, with the cavern orchard and mosaic stone constraining Elian's methods and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his POV, such as the pulsing fruits and dripping stalactites. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around understanding emotion escalate through Elian's agency, using the glass eyes and mosaic to deepen his observations. Under the accumulative lens, density increases to the climax where Lyra's image appears, forcing a trade-off with cost legible in his acceptance. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of integrating loss emerges organically from events and images, such as the chipped patterns symbolizing imperfection, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elian's realization, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the orchard's brightening fruits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Elian's introspective nature. Prose rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, as in the description of the emotional aura shifts. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely, such as "the fruits brightening slightly as if in sympathy." Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mathematics and emotion in a fresh, non-obvious way, transformed through specific details like the glass eyes and mosaic. Risk-taking in thematic depth pays off with inevitability in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, supporting singularity of vision.</comment>
