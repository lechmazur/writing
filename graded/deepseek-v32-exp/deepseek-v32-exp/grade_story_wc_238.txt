<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. Her belief in "imperfect miracles" is embodied in the climax, earning the final renunciation. However, interior contradiction is minimal, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the apology and forgiveness reconfigure meaning amid the orchard's loss. Hybrid lens holds tightly, with cost legible in the chainsaws at dawn. Orientation is immediate, and causality is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the archive hosts the ghost, the orchard roots Isabella's spirit. Sensory details (scent of orange blossoms) charge the final image. The perfume bottle as micro-setting alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (facilitating apology) escalates under hybrid lens via Elara's agency with the device. Cost is unmistakable in the orchard's destruction and peaceful resolution. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through particulars like the apple blossom's dew-script "forgiven," offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing. Resonance reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—practical yet mystical. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., spirits' communication) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("paper ghosts") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exorcism and gossip-column tropes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the hybrid causal-textural lens. Specific details (induced currents) transform familiar material. Bold choices heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
