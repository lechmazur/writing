<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her meditative actions; interiority is concrete through embodied focus and memory recall. The final realization is earned by prior causality, with cost in her profound peace. Minor abstraction in emotional description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in Elara's "profound peace" and the ghost's dissolution. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of retracing builds cohesively to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse constrains choice and charges the final image as a "cathedral for introspection"; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with ivy, broken glass, and butterflies enriching atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in retracing steps and matching ribbons to butterflies; cost is visible in her transformed understanding and the ghost's fade. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like ribbons and migrations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's shape without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, such as the breeze shaping unspoken verses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and meditative, consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but effective through non-verbal ghostly guidance, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with varied rhythm and clear propulsion; no major artifacts or loops. Minor overwriting in phrases like "thundering calm" is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
