<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism and motivation to weave continuity are clear and consistent, with micro-choices like incorporating the scrap and welcoming wanderers revealing her values. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, and emotions sometimes rely on telling rather than embodied depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, with Elara's endurance foreclosing violence amid chaos, cost legible in the tranquil blaze against darkness. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and density. Orientation is clear early, and causality smooth with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass-domed enclosure and desert roses pressuring choices as a sanctuary. Sensory details are selective, and the micro-setting of plants and scrap constrains actions and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity escalates accumulatively through Elara's agency, with plants growing robust and wanderers drawn, cost felt in the external chaos. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening of options, leaning on pattern over causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of peace through nurturing emerges organically from events and symbols, with subtext in the engraved quiet and plant growth. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the legacy of cuttings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice reflecting Elara's perceptive nature. Dialogue with wanderers is natural and goal-driven, and perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and high information density, avoiding loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "tranquil blaze" is pattern-taught and pays off, though minor repetition occurs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and specific, transforming post-apocalyptic tropes through grounded details like inculcating plants. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in accumulative design heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
