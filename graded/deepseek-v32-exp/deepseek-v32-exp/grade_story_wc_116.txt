<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "restlessness stirred within them." The final renunciation of gripping reality is earned by the journey, with visible cost in the release. However, the internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "they could release their tight hold on the tangible world." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and orientation is clear early. The origami swan's use provides a coherent pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the library and refuge constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "moss clung to crumbling shelves" are filtered through POV, but spatial choreography is slightly abstract in the fold journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the accumulative lens, from restlessness to peace, with cost legible in the release of reality. The stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully, though it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in the river and swan. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "eternity in decay," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature in phrases like "gripping reality loosely." No head-hopping; elision in the fold journey is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent, though minor repetition in "crumbling peace" occurs without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing decay and renewal through unique elements like the origami swan. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
