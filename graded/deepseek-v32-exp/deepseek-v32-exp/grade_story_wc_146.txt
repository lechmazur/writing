The final choice is earned but lacks visible cost or transformation, limiting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens, as the town revives with balance restored, and cost is legible in Elian's effort and the prevention of collapse. The drive lens holds throughout, with vibrations and rhythm building cohesively. Orientation is clear early, and the archway's pulsing light charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dust devils and cobblestones, constraining choices through Elian's interactions and vibrations.

Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring balance escalates through Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens, with rhythmic pacing and tuning fork use leading to revival.

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of balance and connection emerges organically from events and images, such as vibrations and whispers, without direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with a stable single POV, featuring a perceptual signature biased toward rhythm and sensory detail.
