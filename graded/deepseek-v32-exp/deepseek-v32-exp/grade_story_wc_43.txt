<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with decisively kind actions. However, her character lacks internal contradiction or flawed struggle, rendering her slightly idealized without the complexity required for the highest band. Alistair's emotional arc is more embodied, but Elara's steadiness limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost in Alistair's peaceful death and the completed reunion, under a hybrid causal-accumulative lens. The broken vinyl shard acts as a persistent constraint, charging the final image. Orientation is immediate, and causality flows logically from diagnosis to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like the jasmine scent and cloud-high sanctuary are vivid and selective, enriching atmosphere. The vinyl shard charges the final image, but the setting itself does not actively constrain choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of a flawless goodbye escalates through Elara's agency, culminating in Alistair's reconciliation and death with unmistakable cost. Pressure tightens under the hybrid lens via her intentional actions, such as suggesting the recorded message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness in fragmentation emerges through particulars like the broken vinyl and hymning the mundane, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and symbols, avoiding exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's serene voice modulates purposefully under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with clean mechanics and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or overwriting. Minor scaffold in repeated motifs like "pulsing stillness" is intentional, but prevents a higher band due to slight decorative phrasing in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of hospice therapy using broken vinyl is a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details. Emotional truth feels inevitable, though risk-taking is moderate, lacking bold structural innovation.</comment>
