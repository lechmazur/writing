<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like urging truth from the townsman. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats, and emotional progression is somewhat tidy, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost as light returns, under a coherent causal lens. The covenant of rust persistently shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early, but minor elision in the townsman's entrance slightly weakens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The resonance chamber constrains choice by amplifying sound, and sensory details like "humming resonance" are purposefully integrated. The music box and chip function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though spatial choreography is briefly vague at the entrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation is driven by Elian's agency when the townsman's lie forces a tightening. Cost is legible as gears wilt, but the conflict resolves quickly, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through mending metaphysical fractures, with subtext in the covenant's tie to truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward exposition in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic diction like "tinkersong wonder." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, but minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "stained with oil and starlight" is coherent and advances momentum, though a slight overuse of modifiers in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements like the covenant of rust and mending what isn't torn, transforming tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking in metaphysical repair heightens coherence, but concept familiarity slightly limits freshness.</comment>
