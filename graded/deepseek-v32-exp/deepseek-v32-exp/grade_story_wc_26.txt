<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., clutching the river stone). The final regret is earned but slightly summarized, reducing full dramatization of internal conflict at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and resonant reconfiguration (transformation of shadow, cost in questioning hope). Causal lens holds strong; orientation is immediate; cost is legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (e.g., "crystalline shelves," "cloud line") filtered through POV. The library and river stone constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving hope) escalates through Elara's agency under causal lens, from observation to transformative act. Cost is unmistakable in her regret, though escalation is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery (shadow transformation, river stone) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on hope's cost, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, observant). Voice modulates with emotional pressure, though some register elevation in peak beats ("luminous regret") fits tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with varied syntax and clear propulsion. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, but minor purple phrasing ("beautiful, sorrowful light") doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shared dreams and metaphysical conflict feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style and philosophical depth heightens stakes without obscuring coherence; tropes are transformed through specificity.</comment>
