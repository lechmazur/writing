<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; his final renunciation of isolation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the letter-writing act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias finds peace, cost legible in his transformed solitude; accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early and no causality breaks.</comment>
