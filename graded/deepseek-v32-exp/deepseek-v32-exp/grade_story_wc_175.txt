<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; however, internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contradictory, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as he unties the wing, under an accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and the grotto's isolation persistently shapes tactics, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto constrains choice and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through POV; the moth wing as a micro-setting object reweights meaning decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, escalation is driven by Elian's agency in building and untying, with cost legible in the release; though quiet, pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges through concrete events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical voice; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful, though minor register consistency holds it from highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with clear propulsion; no major artifacts or loops, though slight figurative density in peaks prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing esoteric realism with ecological loss; risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
