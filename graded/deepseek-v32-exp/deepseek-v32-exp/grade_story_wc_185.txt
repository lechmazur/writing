<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped, and the resolution, while earned, lacks the nuanced contradictory impulses required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost ("exhausted but fulfilled") as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, driven by persistent constraints (stone and ice patterns). Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks, making the repose feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and ice cracks constrain choices and charge the final image with ethereal luminescence. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, fully integrated into Elara's goal-directed actions, making the setting indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in using the stone and examining cracks, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens with legible cost (exhaustion). The stake (finding quiet) tightens meaningfully, though the progression is somewhat linear, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through concrete events and images like the "bloom of hush," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the theme occasionally edges toward explicit statement in terms like "harmony," slightly reducing subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; the poetic voice ("hammered repose") remains consistent and heightens emotional beats without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, and propulsion never falters, supporting closure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements (mapkeeper, harmonic caves) with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off, though it stops short of groundbreaking transformation, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
