<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to reverse her narrative approach is earned by the argument and reflections, showing credible endurance with visible cost. However, her serenity sometimes edges toward passive acceptance, slightly limiting internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her adapted approach, under a Hybrid drive lens. The structure is causal from argument to decision, but the accumulative reflections dilute tight causality. Orientation is clear early, though the lens ambiguity slightly weakens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The radar dome setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, charging the final image with its acoustic oddities and reflective atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to mirror internal states. The micro-setting of the story stick and tools reinforces tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of artistic integrity escalates through Elara's agency in deciding to reverse her narrative arc, with cost legible in her adaptation. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, but the internal conflict lacks external tightening, relying on reflection over active confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges through concrete events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like the story stick as a bridge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through redemption-focused revision, avoiding moralizing but leaning slightly toward explicit epiphanies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending urbane reflection with gritty themes. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, though minor register drift occurs in phrases like "meteor hush." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has good rhythm and density, advancing story with selective figurative language. However, minor overwriting and repetitive stems (e.g., "meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") create slight momentum drag without obscuring closure. No major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligrapher, puppet shows, and radar dome feels organic and fresh, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in internal focus heightens stakes, but the concept is not groundbreaking, relying on familiar introspection arcs.</comment>
