<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like "lucid unrest." However, Kael's passivity and lack of deep internal contradiction in Elara prevent a higher score, though her final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost in "weight lift from her shoulders" and "final sigh of relief," under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the net's constraint shapes tactics, but minor ambiguity in lens hybridity slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "crystalline walls" and "smelling of salt and time" are purposeful, and the net constrains choices, charging the final image. The prism sanctuary's breathing atmosphere integrates seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in unraveling knots, with cost legible in accumulated silence and her slip. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, though the conflict lacks deep complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like unraveling knots and "we are all restorers," with subtext in silence and secrets. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but the explicit statement slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Elara, with a distinct poetic voice like "lucid unrest." Dialogue is natural and advances plot, and perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "accumulated silence" enhances without muddle, and closure is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a unique synthesis of restoration and spiritual unraveling, grounded in specific details. It feels inevitable in hindsight, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking bold structural innovation.</comment>
