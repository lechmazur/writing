<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt is concretely embodied through tactile details like the cool watch hand and damp sand, and her internal conflict drives the narrative to an earned renunciation of her trade, with visible cost in the final acceptance of regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara accepts the truth about the brother's death, under a causal lens where her guilt motivates each step; the cost is legible in "the weight of that truth crashed down," and orientation is clear early.</comment>
