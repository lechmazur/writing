<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and drives her actions; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "drowning in yesterday's echoes"). Her final choice to disintegrate the bridge is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the visions fading. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the bridge disintegrates, breaking the retrocognitive loop with cost legible in "visions flickered and fractured." The accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the fractal time realization. Orientation is clear early, and the halo fragment's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the living bridge garden and hyperbolic geometry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "shimmering afterimages" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment directly pressures Elara's actions, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of breaking the loop escalates through Elara's agency in adjusting the maze, leading to the disintegration. Cost is unmistakable in the bridge's transformation and visions fading. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully with a single tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time as a fractal tapestry emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the disintegration and renewal. Subtext operates in gestures like the fading photographs vanishing, deepening reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and introspective, reflecting Elara's profession. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the hyperbolic geometry teaching its pattern. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "prison of shadows" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the disintegration beat, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hedge maze design, retrocognition, and hyperbolic geometry feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in non-linear time concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
