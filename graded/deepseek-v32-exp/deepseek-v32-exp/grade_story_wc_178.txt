<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's frugality and empirical irony are consistently embodied, driving his choices and the climax; his internal conflict when noting the irony adds depth, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tile fusing, calm settling); causal lens holds tightly from setup to payoff, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The palace setting actively constrains Aris's method as a architectural blueprint, with sensory details like "lavender sky" and mosaics charging the final image where the tile fuses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency with the tile and diagrams, narrowing options to the revelation; cost is legible in the tile's fusion and the wave of calm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing, culminating in the resonant realization that "devotion was in the seeking itself," reweighting prior material through specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., irony) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; sentences like "dusky harmony" advance story and atmosphere with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomy, magic, and devotion feels inevitable; risk-taking in philosophical quest tropes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
