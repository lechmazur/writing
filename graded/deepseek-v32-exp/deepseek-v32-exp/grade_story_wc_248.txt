<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and credible transformation from arsonist to preserver. The final choice is earned by prior causality, though minor tell-y moments in analytical intuition slightly reduce depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Kaelen's transformation redefines his purpose, under a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages. The vandalized portrait as a map encodes directions, shaping tactics and reinforcing the persistent constraint of his past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the archive's maze-like corridors and tactile details like the "shaft of light" are filtered through Kaelen's goal-directed perception, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency in following the artistic trail, narrowing options to the hidden chamber with visible cost in his transformation. The dominant stake of rescuing the promise tightens through each discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Kaelen's arc, with subtext in volcanic tenderness and the tapestry's message, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor explicitness in epiphanies slightly limits ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with analytical diction reflecting Kaelen's mind under pressure. However, slight register consistency issues in peak beats prevent higher scoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no major artifacts. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "volcanic tenderness" does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes arsonist and preserver roles with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in character concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
