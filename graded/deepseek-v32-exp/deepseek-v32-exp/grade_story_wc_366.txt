<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian's reticent and observant nature is consistently embodied, driving his actions from reading the note to relighting the lamp. His motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like placing the sea glass revealing his values. The final choice to relight the lamp is earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions are subtle rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: the dark lighthouse prompts investigation, the note escalates stakes, and cairn-building leads to relighting. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the presence recedes but the "luminescent ache" remains—anchored in the final image. Orientation is immediate, and the structure tightens coherently to a resonant end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-driven: the fog-shrouded island and haunted lantern room constrain Elian's choices, while the cove provides stones for the cairn. Sensory details like the "cold, curved wall" and "luminescent ache" are filtered through his POV, charging the final image where the sea glass gleams. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maritime safety escalates through Elian's agency: finding the note with its plea forces him to build the cairn and relight the lamp, narrowing options. Cost is legible as the "malevolent chill" intensifies and recedes, affirming his protective role. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared vigilance emerges through particulars like the letter chain and cairns, avoiding direct statement. Subtext operates in the sea glass and the haunting's calm, with the ending offering a non-literal answer—safety "bottled" in the persistent glow. Resonance arises from concrete actions without moralizing, though it leans slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct lyrical voice reflecting Elian's observant nature. Prose rhythm and diction ("luminescent ache," "cold, complex jewel") enhance texture without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong, and purposeful compression, like the note's revelation, serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms that propel momentum. Figurative language like "luminescent ache" is purposeful and consistent, avoiding loops or scaffolds. Read-aloud flow is smooth, and peak beats maintain clarity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes haunted lighthouse tropes with original elements like anonymous letters and cairn messaging, transformed through specific details (sea glass, "bottling safety"). Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivativeness, and the closure reweights prior material ingeniously. Risk-taking in the atmospheric payoff heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
