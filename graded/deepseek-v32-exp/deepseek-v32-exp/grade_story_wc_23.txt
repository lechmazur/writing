<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, driving her actions consistently. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "raw solace," and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., aligning the censer foot) reveal her values. The final renunciation is earned through prior causality, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "acceptance, not the erasure, of her pain." The Accumulative lens holds, with elements building to a coherent pattern. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the censer foot's lunar constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the starlit station and censer foot acting as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., aligning with Polaris). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The station's isolation pressures Elara's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) escalates through Elara's agency in building the resonator, under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in "raw solace" and the confrontation with past sorrow. One meaningful tightening occurs as the resonator hums and shifts her grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the reverse migration and censer foot's glow, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through acceptance, reweighting prior material. Subtext in the phone calls being her own voice deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice ("geography of loss"). Dialogue (phone calls) is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (voice reveal) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, enhancing momentum. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and the final image resonates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of reverse migration and psychic navigation, transformed through specific details like the censer foot. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative build) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The voice reveal feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
