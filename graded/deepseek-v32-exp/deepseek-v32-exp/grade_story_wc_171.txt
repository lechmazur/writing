<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, and the sacrifice, while earned, feels somewhat predetermined without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (Elara's fading), causal lens holds tightly, and the ritual's persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the terrace and clipboard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, with cost unmistakable in her sacrifice. The ritual tightens options meaningfully, and the peace achieved requires continued effort, adding depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of redemption and sacrifice emerge organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is consistently poetic, with a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; elision is taught and paid off, though minor convergence in emotional peaks occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and character efficiently, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh with specific synthesis of ritual and sacrifice, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes, though it echoes familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
