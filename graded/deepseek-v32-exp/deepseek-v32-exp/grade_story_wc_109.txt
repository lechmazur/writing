<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; emotions are summarized rather than embodied under pressure, with traits like "mildly obsessed" told not shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost implied in weariness and chill, but it is not sharply felt or pivotal; orientation is clear early, and lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "robes whispering" and "howled like forgotten gods"; the ridge fort and booklet function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (creating the map), and escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens through density of silence summarization, but cost is mild and agency lacks a decisive trade-off; no reversal tightens options significantly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence and guidance emerges organically through images and actions, with a resonant, non-literal ending; however, it leans abstract without deeper counter-readings or complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., silence summarization) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and purposeful, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts; but some overwriting occurs (e.g., "ambered hush" repetition), and figurative language occasionally blurs sense in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is original and synthesizes elements uniquely; the method of summarizing silence feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
