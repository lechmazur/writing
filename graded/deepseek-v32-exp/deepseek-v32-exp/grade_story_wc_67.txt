<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to crystallize emotion is clear and drives choices; internal conflict between love and disappointment is embodied in actions like grinding the mask. The final renunciation (acceptance) is earned with visible cost ("weight lift"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost ("weight lift"); accumulative/textural lens holds through ritual buildup. Orientation is clear early, and incomplete information shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (gallery, chair) constrains choice (amplifies solitude) and charges the final portrait; sensory details (charcoal dust, jagged edges) are vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting integrates with emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency (grinding the mask) under accumulative lens, deepening emotional stakes; cost is unmistakable in weight lift and dissolution of illusion. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of safety mirage and forgiveness emerges through particulars (mask, portrait) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("replaced by acceptance"). Subtext operates in imagery and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure ("creaked its rhythm toward silence"). No head-hopping; elision (incomplete information) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("resin of regret and hope"). Clarity and propulsion maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and art rituals feels inevitable; specific details (porcelain shards as broken promises) avoid cliché. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
