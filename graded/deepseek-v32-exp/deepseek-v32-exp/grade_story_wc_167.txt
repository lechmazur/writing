<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her trait of finding value in the mundane. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the lantern and throwing the stone. The final endurance (accepting change) is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtle. No major flaws, but minor lack of overt contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her realization that "change was not to be feared." Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout via pattern buildup. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Structure is a single scene with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp planks" and "mist coiling" filtered through Elara's POV. The pond at the atrium's center constrains her choice and charges the final image, elevating it beyond description. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the sunbeam climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict about change) is signaled early and escalates through her ritual with the stone, culminating in the sunbeam revelation. Protagonist agency drives the deepening under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her shifted stance. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ripples and glass, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of rainbows and ripples, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the stone cast reflecting consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "read between the lines" and "communion with physics." Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., the dredge project) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings" feels slightly forced) but no major artifacts or loops. Clarity is maintained, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of glazier, prism atrium, and ripples is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details anchor universals, and the core premise is transformed through character-specific choices.</comment>
