<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and motivation to imprison the sky are consistently embodied through micro-choices like searching by scent and using the coin, with the final acceptance earned by prior causality; however, contradictory impulses are more sequential than simultaneous, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as Elara accepts the sky's unbounded nature, with cost legible in "strange peace"; causal lens holds tight through because/therefore linkages like the coin puzzle leading to realization, and time pressure persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree library setting constrains choice through demolition deadline and hollowed shelves, charging the final image of the shimmering mural; sensory details like "scent of oak and ink" are selective and POV-filtered, but spatial choreography remains slightly vague during the search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirroring the sky) escalates under causal lens via Elara's agency in finding the safe and crafting the mural, with cost unmistakable in the static sky realization; one meaningful tightening forecloses her goal with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of limits emerges through particulars like the fractal sketch and demolition rumble, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the sky's enduring freedom; no moralizing, but the concept slightly echoes rather than deeply transforms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature shaped by face blindness (e.g., "shapes and textures"); lyrical rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision like the coin's backstory is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "fractally precise" serves pressure, and closure image is clear, though minor poetic phrasing ("profound hush") leans decorative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face blindness and celestial mapping feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet climax heightening stakes; specificity in elements like the coin and tree library avoids template plots, but transformation of familiar quest tropes is solid rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
