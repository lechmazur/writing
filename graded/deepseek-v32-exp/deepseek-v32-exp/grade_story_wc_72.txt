<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The statue's motivation to welcome nuance is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving higher-stakes choices like using the ampoule. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in lines like "its mind, incisively kind, pierced the solitude." The final change from isolation to community is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in its transformed duty. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as recalling foxglove's duality while seeking answers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the statue embraces community and reinforces the garden's magic, with felt cost in its relinquished solitude. The causal lens holds strongly, with revelations building because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The persistent constraint of structural weakness shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater city garden constrains choices and charges the final image, as seen when the statue uses structural weaknesses to thread essence. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "drifting seaweed" and "iridescent coral," filtered through the statue's POV. The setting pressures choices by serving as a living library and alters tactics through its crumbling arches. Micro-setting elements like the ampoule and coral beds are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the statue's agency under the causal lens, such as telepathically guiding the ampoule's essence to activate revelations. The dominant stake of understanding duty tightens through meaningful turns, foreclosing isolation with visible cost in the embrace of complexity. Pressure coheres and grows, with one key reversal when the statue learns it was a scholar, changing knowledge and options. The cost is legible in the final reinforcement of magic through vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as foxglove's duality mirroring the statue's journey, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the statue's realization that guardianship involves change, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like placing the empty ampoule among sea roots, symbolizing transformed understanding. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the harmonious balance of stillness and potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the statue's telepathic perception and poetic rhythm. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, such as in "pierced the solitude with telepathic tendrils," maintaining coherence under pressure. Purposeful compression is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping. The narrative stance is consistent, and diction reflects the statue's incisively kind nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence openings and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, like "cascading revelations intensified," without muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; syntax accelerates with scene needs, as in the activation of hidden inscriptions. The final line resonates with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar ideas with fresh specificity, such as the living statue as a guardian of knowledge, transformed through grounded choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with the statue's voluntary act of love adding depth. Risk-taking in the animate lifeless tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, with a non-obvious angle on solitude and community.</comment>
