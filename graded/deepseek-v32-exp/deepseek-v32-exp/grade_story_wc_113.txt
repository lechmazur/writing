<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure; her final action to disrupt the water is earned by prior causality, and interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the ghost is released, causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early; the persistent constraint of the flooded setting shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as wading through water and using the flooded environment to reveal secrets; the opera house as micro-setting charges the final image and integrates with theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling the code escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens; cost is unmistakable in the ghost's release, and one meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of liminal spaces and art in decay emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, subtext operating through gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, and sentence-level rhythm supports atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and musical elements feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes, and specificity anchors universals without derivative echoes.</comment>
