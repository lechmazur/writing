<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, rendering her determination somewhat one-note. Her emotions are embodied (e.g., "hauntingly optimistic"), but no flaws or blind spots complicate her choices, limiting depth. The final action is earned but without visible personal cost, preventing higher scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the labyrinth's restoration completes Elara's goal with felt cost in her effort. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through the sleepwalking paths method. However, the abstract nature of the method slightly weakens causal tightness, though it serves the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., red canyon walls, post-tidal light) integrated into action and constraining choices. The labyrinth actively pressures Elara's navigation and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test. No generic or static description undermines momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as sewing in the central chamber deepens the restoration. Cost is felt in the effort and transformation, but lacks unmistakable visceral price. Agency drives the tightening, though absence of overt conflict limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration emerges through concrete actions and images (e.g., sewing, broken precedents) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "path carved in spirit," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in metaphorical threads, but slight abstraction prevents top-tier scores.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature tuned to "rhythms of the sea and stone." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., sleepwalking paths) are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register shifts disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense, with varied rhythm and clear propulsion, though minor over-poeticism (e.g., "orchid solace") risks slight abstraction. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; figurative language is generally purposeful. Closure image remains sharp, but peak beats have minimal muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes unique elements (wharf weaver, sewing as mending) with specificity and emotional truth, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes; no derivative echoes or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
