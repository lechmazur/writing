<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with internal conflict shown through "combative tenderness." Her final choice to detach is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices like clutching the scrimshaw reveal hierarchy of values. The guarded heart unlocking is embodied, not labeled, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elara steps onto the island, surrendering her old life. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from the call to detachment. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the scrimshaw as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "dark, wet stones of the sublittoral fringe." The environment constrains choice by being the liminal space where the island appears, and the scrimshaw object charges the final image as it dissolves into sea foam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freedom vs. safety escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency in responding to the whale's call. Cost is legible in her "surrender to her true nature," foreclosing the shore life with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing true self emerges through particulars like the scrimshaw and island, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the dissolution of the scrimshaw, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, lyrical rhythm, and controlled diction. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., the call's nature) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "combative tenderness" is purposeful, and closure beat is clear with "scrimshaw dissolved into sea foam," showing propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of Great Pacification and disappearing island is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in lyrical closure heightens stakes, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight with emotional specificity.</comment>
