<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. Her involuntary truthfulness constrains actions and adds depth, though internal conflict is somewhat minimal. Micro-choices, like reading the riddle aloud, reveal her values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with coherent because/therefore linkages from blackout to riddle to resolution. Closure is a decisive change (power restored) with felt cost in the effort. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, as the lightning tower's summit requires climbing and spraying water. Sensory details like "nectar-dusk hues" are purposeful and charged in the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent during the ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring power/preserving wonder) escalates through protagonist agency, with a meaningful tightening when they simulate rain. Cost is legible in the reboot effort, and resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in routine emerges through concrete actions and the riddle's resolution, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with Elara's reflection on beauty in the ordinary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction with Elara's truthful nature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minor convergence in voice under stress. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with varied rhythm, but some figurative density (e.g., "like a dream at nectar-dusk") slightly muddles peak beats. No major loops or scaffolds; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (toll keeper, drone beehives, riddle) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes.</comment>
