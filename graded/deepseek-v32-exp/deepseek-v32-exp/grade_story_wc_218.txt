<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her diagnosis, with embodied emotion and systematic actions. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or flawed impulses, preventing a higher score; her "brazen calm" remains uniform without on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—the orchard achieves interspecies understanding—and cost is legible through Elara's weakening body. The causal lens holds tightly from diagnosis to legacy, with the time constraint shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly specific, constraining Elara's choices and charging the final image of intertwined oak and pillar. Sensory details like "hummed with a low, ancient energy" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (fostering interspecies respect) escalate under causal lens via Elara's agency against the time constraint. Cost is unmistakable in her physical decline and the foreclosed path of inaction, driving one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and respect emerges organically from events, with the final sketch offering a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext operates through imagery and action, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a calm, observational voice that reflects Elara's character. Prose rhythm and perceptual signature remain controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time jumps) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences like "The copper wires would eventually be absorbed" advance story and atmosphere cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes caretaker role, mystical ecology, and mortality into a fresh, inevitable whole. Specificity in method (copper wire, oak) avoids tropes, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking transformative boldness.</comment>
