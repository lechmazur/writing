<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her sympathetic skepticism and desire to offer solace. Her internal conflict between skepticism and belief is embodied through specific actions like tracing the tile, and her final choice to act with brave compassion is earned by the visions. However, some emotional beats rely on told summary (e.g., "Moved by that legacy") rather than fully dramatized contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara shares the transcribed map, reconfiguring her role and the tower's purpose with visible cost in her overcome doubts. The causal lens holds strong, with because/therefore linkages from tile interaction to village invitation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored with sensory details like "salt-laced wind" and "whale songs," and the tower and tile constrain choices by enabling the reflective space. The tile charges the final image as a conduit, but the environment's pressure on tactics is slightly underdeveloped, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (creating reflective peace) escalate through Elara's agency in transcribing, which narrows options via visions and leads to her sharing the map. Cost is legible in her relinquished skepticism, but the escalation relies slightly on passive vision sequences rather than fully active pursuit, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of entangled memories and skepticism/sympathy emerges organically through the tile's visions and the unheard symphony, with a non-literal answer in the collective spirit. Subtext operates in gestures like the whales' songs blending, but minor thematic echoing ("unheard symphony" repeated) slightly reduces resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elara's perceptual signature as a historian filtering details like "brittle scroll." Voice is lyrical yet controlled, and elision (e.g., forgotten patterns) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and rhythmic variation supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has strong rhythm and density, with sentences advancing multiple roles (e.g., "the tile was cold against her palm" embodies character). Minor template cadence in repetitive "entangled memories" phrases and a slight register drift in peak beats ("courageously kind") prevent higher scores, but clarity and propulsion remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial history, magic square, and whale migration feels fresh and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the tile's pulsing memories. Risk-taking in lyrical closure pays off, but close echoes of common "unheard symphony" motifs limit uniqueness.</comment>
