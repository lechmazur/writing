<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory as a defunct revolutionary, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "burnished sorrow," and micro-choices, such as devising the experiment, reveal her values. The final renunciation of her failed revolution is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages: Elara's observation during the storm leads to her experiment, which reveals the past and resolves the dispute. Closure is a decisive change as she presents her findings and finds peace, with cost legible in her sorrow. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with the baroque asteroid, visible time strands, and ion storms, all filtering through Elara's POV. The environment constrains choices, such as covering mirrors and using the crystal shard, which charges the final image in the museum. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the archaeological dispute and Elara's personal quest, signaled early. Escalation is driven by her agency under the causal lens, as the experiment narrows options and changes knowledge with cost in her sorrow. Pressure coheres through Professor Kael's dismissal and the storm test, leading to a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as covering mirrors as a metaphor for inward focus, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to reimagining civilization through poetry, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the mirror covering, and ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Elara's mindset. Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., the experiment details) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and prose rhythm varies with emotional intensity, supporting pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "time weaving like golden threads" is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story and character, and closure image is clear without muddle, demonstrating mastery under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of visible time, archaeological dispute, and poetic reinterpretation, transformed through specific details. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept commits fully, with originality in Elara's arc and the civilization's portrayal.</comment>
