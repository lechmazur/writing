<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like using the seed revealing her values. However, interiority sometimes relies on abstract metaphors ("emotions locked away like seeds in winter") rather than fully embodied emotion, slightly weakening peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (Elara's guardedness unbends, seed crumbles) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early. The frozen confession's revelation as "Morwen" reconfigures the curse with felt consequence, though the linkage from failed magic trick to search could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (vortex pulls at cloak, seeds threaten soul) and charges the final image with tranquil grove. Sensory details like "petals and decay" are selective and POV-filtered, with the flesh-eating seed constraining the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under causal lens: searching circles, using seed to unbend confession. Cost is legible as seed crumbles and silence lifts, narrowing options meaningfully. Stakes around truth and silence deepen cohesively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus silence emerges through concrete events (unbending confession) without moralizing; ending offers resonant non-literal answer ("some lost things are meant to be found"). Subtext in frozen confession's betrayal enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("warlike serenity"). Poetic voice controls rhythm under pressure, though occasional ornate phrasing ("swirling orchard vortex churned the water into a froth") minimally distracts. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in dense metaphors ("a calm that promised violence") risks clarity in peak beats. No major loops or artifacts; closure remains clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of druid lore, cursed confession, and flesh-eating seeds feels organic and inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific stakes. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
