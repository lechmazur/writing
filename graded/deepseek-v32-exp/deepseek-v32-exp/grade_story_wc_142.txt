<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction is vividly embodied through her dual allegiance and micro-choices like rubbing the foundation stone chip. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes actions such as encoding messages in graffiti. The final choice to paint resilience is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her weary accomplishment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost in the "weary accomplishment" and "hopeful desperation," reconfiguring options under a causal lens. The privatization deadline and corporate shadows persistently constrain tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city and perpetual carnival supply resources that alter tactics, such as using chaotic beauty as a shield for graffiti. Sensory details like "scent of fried dough and salt" are selective and purposeful. The foundation stone chip recurs to charge the final image, constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in painting graffiti to reorganize resistance, narrowing options under causal pressure. The cost is legible in her weariness and the "imposing" corporate shadows. Dominant stake in community survival tightens meaningfully with the deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the foundation stone and graffiti, offering a non-literal answer to progress vs. soul without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature filtering setting through Elara's priorities.
