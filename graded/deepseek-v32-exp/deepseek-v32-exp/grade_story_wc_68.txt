<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied internal conflict ("agonized over this duty daily") and micro-choices under pressure. However, some repetition in her agony slightly reduces depth, though the final resolve is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("the weight of that struggle in her bones"). Accumulative/textural lens holds, oriented early, and persistent constraints (cog, layers) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the sewer layers and cog constraining choices and charging the final image. Specific details like "sedimentary layers" and "dim light" are integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) escalates under accumulative lens through Elara's agency (descending, uncovering equations). Cost is legible in isolation and weight, though escalation is more gradual than tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (cog, layers) without moralizing; ending reweights prior material through her resolve. Subtext in actions and objects avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("abrasive calm," philosophical tone). Voice remains coherent under pressure, though some phrasal repetition occurs without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "agonized" reiterations) and template cadence in reflective beats slightly reduce momentum. No major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic preservation with specific details (sewer philosopher, cog). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
