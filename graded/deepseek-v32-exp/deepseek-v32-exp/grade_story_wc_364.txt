<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure driving his transformation from meek to determined; however, the mage is underdeveloped as a secondary character, slightly limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—Elian's personal and community transformation—under a causal lens, with cost felt in the barter and enduring efforts; orientation is early and transitions are legible across shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard planet and floating arches constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are integrated through action, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the silk to bartering and forging, with cost legible in the trade-off and renewed purpose; one meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in "azure defiance" and a resonant, non-literal answer at the end; no moralizing, though it leans slightly explicit in moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; dialogue with the mage is natural and goal-driven, and prose rhythm supports emotional pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "azure defiance" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes through specific setting and character-driven stakes; risk-taking in the unique premise heightens coherence without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
