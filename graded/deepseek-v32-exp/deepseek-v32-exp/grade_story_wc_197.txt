<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his resourceful actions. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like desperation creeping in. The final choice to share truths is earned by prior causality, though some moments lean toward telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kael records and disseminates the hidden histories, breaking apathy with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong from puddle map to lagoon revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the structure supports a coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Settings like the auric lagoon and city outskirts are vivid and sensory, with puddle reflections and starlight guiding choices. The lagoon charges the final image, but environmental pressure on tactics is somewhat minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes against indifference escalate through Kael's agency, from unraveling plans to accessing records. One meaningful tightening occurs as he uses the key, narrowing options with visible cost in the dissemination effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus indifference emerges through events and images like the lagoon's glow, without moralizing. Subtext in the key as a bridge to eras adds depth, but some thematic echoes are slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, filtering details through Kael's archivist lens. No dialogue, but prose rhythm supports pressure; minor register consistency in peak beats.</comment>
