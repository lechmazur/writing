<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in duty, with embodied emotion (e.g., brass cool against fingers) and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is more reflective than actively in-scene, and the final endurance, while earned, lacks deep internal conflict, capping the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with cost (relief and sorrow) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of recurring duty shapes tactics. Minor deduction for slight predictability in the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the grotto and atrium constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (dewdrops, mist) are filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing chaos) escalates through Elias's agency using negative space, with cost legible in the temporary peace. Under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes, but escalation is subtle without major turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (silence, duty) emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in negative space and nostalgia. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though some repetition of "eerie nostalgia" slightly dampens effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density, but minor repetitions (e.g., "vested hush," "eerie nostalgia") create slight scaffold artifacts, though not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details like negative space method. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet closure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
