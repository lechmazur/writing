<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with internal conflict embodied in her "nervously confident" demeanor. Her actions align with her goal, and the final exoneration is earned through causal efforts. However, some emotional beats rely on summary rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with clear orientation and closure achieved through the exoneration, carrying emotional cost. The copper nail's retrieval and report presentation form a decisive change, though the committee's deliberation feels slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the "skeletal" weather station to the ocean floor wreck, constraining choices via data banks and probes. The copper nail charges the final image, but sensory detail occasionally prioritizes visual over other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalating through research and discovery driven by Elara's agency. The cost is legible in her emotional weight and the storm's symbolism, though the middle lacks a tight causal turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of justice and memory emerges through coded stanzas and the nail's retrieval, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without explicit statement, but subtext in dialogue is minimal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, and voice modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural but sparse; minor register consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise with good rhythm, but "spongey dread" repetition and minor overwriting in descriptive passages create slight momentum drag. No major artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map librarian, coded journals, and reversible exile feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
