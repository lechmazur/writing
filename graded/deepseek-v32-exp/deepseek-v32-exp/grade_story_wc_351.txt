<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's helix-minded nature is consistently shown through her perception and actions, with clear motivation driving her transformation. Interiority is concrete, and her final change is earned with visible cost. Minor abstraction in emotional description prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens. The transformation is legible and the drive lens holds without contradiction, though slight ambiguity in causality limits the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Setting actively pressures Elara's work, elevating atmosphere beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her integration of memories. One meaningful tightening occurs, though the chaos of emotion slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars without moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through image and implication, but minor thematic echo in the climax holds it back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose reflects Elara's mindset consistently, and any elision is purposeful, though slight register drift in peak beats occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong rhythm, but minor overwriting and figurative stacking in high-pressure beats cause slight muddle. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes engineering and psychic elements with freshness and specificity. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
