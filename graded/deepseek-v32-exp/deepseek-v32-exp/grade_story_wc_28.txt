<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The renaming action is earned by prior causality, showcasing contradictory impulses between past trauma and present resilience. Her motivation as a "gentle radical" is consistently rooted and intensifies, compelling the decisive change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the loosening of retrocognitive shackles—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the plot builds through sensory details and internal reflections to a coherent ending. The mosaic pattern teaches the structure, and the final image reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the ancient plaza and mosaic stepping stone constrain Elara's actions and charge the final image of rebirth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the "warm coldness" tone mirroring internal states. The environment evolves causally with events, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between empathy and past trauma) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase—the retrocognitive surge and pattern tracing—driven by protagonist agency. The renaming narrows options with legible cost: the visions become echoes. Pressure coheres and tightens to the closure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the tessera and renaming, offering a non-literal answer to empathy's resilience. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without statement. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, like the chipped patterns guiding revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflecting Elara's mind. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "warm coldness") is taught and legible. No head-hopping; elision is paid off at closure with consistent diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clear propulsion. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor overwriting is voice-motivated and harmless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes retrocognition and renaming with freshness, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth and risk-taking in lyric style heighten stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable in hindsight, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
