<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as humming her father's tune during the graft. The final act of giving the coin and helping the girl is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with felt cost. However, minor abstraction in emotional description (e.g., "compassion that never yielded") slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the girl's singing and Elara's peace transform pain into beauty with visible cost. The single-scene structure is coherent, and orientation is clear early. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the black sand and coin recur to charge the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are vivid and purposeful, constraining choice by providing the healing material for the graft and charging the final image with thematic resonance. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, avoiding generic description. The setting actively shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in performing the graft, tightening the stakes of healing and redemption with a legible cost in the emotional weight. The dominant stake is signaled early and deepens through the procedure, though the pressure is more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the graft and the coin, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to scars singing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, like the girl's trust and Elara's humming. The ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction with Elara's professional focus. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, though slight register elevation in peaks (e.g., "kelp-drift peace") is minor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without major artifacts. However, minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "kelp-drift peace," and some figurative language risks muddle. No loops or scaffold; closure clarity is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—arsonist's daughter firefighter, black sand graft—feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the premise commits fully.</comment>
