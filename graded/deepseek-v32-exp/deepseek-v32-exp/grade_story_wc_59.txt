<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices driving the narrative. The prince's internal conflict between hope and loss is concretely shown, and his final action is earned by prior causality, though some interiority leans toward summary rather than scene-level contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (the ghostly bird's song) and felt cost ("bitterly sweet, for it could not last"), under a hybrid causal-textural lens. The flawed genesis concept persistently shapes tactics, and orientation is anchored early, but the hypothesizing method is occasionally told rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through the prince's POV. The suspended palace and stalactites constrain choices (providing organic elements) and charge the final image ("stalactite anchors gleaming with moisture"), though some description is slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, and escalation under the hybrid lens is driven by the prince's agency in assembling the device, leading to a cost-legible climax. The bittersweet outcome forecloses a path with visible price, but the conflict lacks multi-layered pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the egg's symbolism and the flawed genesis concept. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the core concept is at times explicitly stated rather than fully implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature consistent under pressure. No dialogue, but narrative stance controls rhythm and diction effectively. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents higher scoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and no loops or artifacts obscure closure. Information density is high, though occasional phrases border on ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality stems from a fresh synthesis of tropes (mechanical world, prince quest) with specific details like the suspended palace and extinct egg. Risk-taking in hybrid drive and lyrical tone heightens stakes, but the premise has echoes of common templates.</comment>
