<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied, with Elian's mournful elation and the ghost bride's motivations rooted in past trauma. Internal contradictions are shown in scene, such as "lovingly venomous" actions, and the final acceptance is earned through causal memory awakening. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with Earned Stasis, as Elian's acceptance forecloses reunion with visible cost in "mournful elation." Hybrid drive lens holds strong, with causal linkages from visits to bead awakening. Orientation is clear within first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the alchemical orchard greenhouse constraining choices and charging the final image through its responsive glow. Sensory details like "luminescent fruits" and "winter-cracked fields" are filtered through POV, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominantly signaled as debt repayment, escalating through the ghost bride's frequent visits and the bead offering. Agency under Hybrid lens drives tightening, with cost legible in Elian's mournful elation and the ghost's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love, debt, and redemption emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in "lovingly venomous" gestures. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the orchard's peace, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elian, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., ghostly appearances) is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "veil flowing like smoke," without muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost lore and alchemy with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through grounded details like the carved bead. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
