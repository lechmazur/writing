<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and rooted in his identity as the "con artist's honest child," with internal conflict dramatized through his refusal to use his father's tricks. His final choice to use the ink pot on the security chief is earned by prior causality, showcasing micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion, like feeling the ink pot's warmth, avoids stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (asylum granted) with felt cost in Leo's moral calculus and the ink pot's use, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. The ink pot as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the cost is legible in the final image of Leo's satisfaction. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly specific and pressures choices, serving as Leo's sanctuary and influencing his actions. Sensory details like "stainless steel table" and "dusted embalming fluid bottles" are selective and purposeful. The ink pot as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image. Quick test satisfied with environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (father's asylum) escalates under the causal lens through Leo's agency in studying schedules and devising the ink pot plan. A meaningful tightening occurs when Leo decides to target the security chief, with cost legible in the moral trade-off. Protagonist-driven escalation narrows options without coincidence resolving conflict. Quick test met with unmistakable cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fairness and transformation emerges through events and the ink pot metaphor, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "rigidity fractures, but fluidity endures," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, like the chief's shifted tone. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Leo's voice, e.g., "deathly vitality." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, carrying subtext in the exchange with the chief. Rhythmic control under pressure with purposeful elision, such as the ink pot's attribute introduction. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and character. Figurative language like "liquefied rigid thinking" is coherent and purposeful, though minor density in metaphors slightly impacts peak beats. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure causality. Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (con artist's son, magical ink pot, political asylum) feels inevitable and transforms tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in the ink pot's attribute heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the mental breach concept, and closure reconfigures meaning. Non-obvious angle on familiar material.</comment>
