<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like tracing the bolt plate. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, and the final renunciation, while earned, leans on thematic resolution rather than deep personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (the warm bolt plate and lingering messages), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the storm timeframe tightens tactics without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—the courtyard's mist and storm electricity constrain Elara's act, while the bolt plate as a micro-setting tool charges the final image with transformative weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in encoding the graffiti, intensifying under the storm's live clock; cost is legible in the ghost's emergence and the glowing mural, though the stake remains internal without external friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically through the graffiti's sigils and the ghost's response, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the enduring messages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, perceptual signature in sensory selection, and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "tinkersong wonder" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (balladeer, ghost in code, graffiti) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the accumulative design and specificity that avoids checklist tropes.</comment>
