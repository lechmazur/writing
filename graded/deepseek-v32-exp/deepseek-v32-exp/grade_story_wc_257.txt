<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "hands too heavy with grief." Micro-choices under pressure, such as following coordinates, reveal a hierarchy of values, and her transformation to teaching others is earned by prior causality. The final choice forecloses her path of isolation with visible cost in shared understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Elara guides another, reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost; the Causal lens holds via because/therefore linkages from clues to discoveries. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (multiple shards) is taught early and legible, with transitions that maintain pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and sensory, constraining choices and charging the final image through objects like the stencil and origami. Details are filtered through Elara's POV, with purposeful integration into action, such as the "shaft of light" illuminating the stencil to reveal cyclical renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming grief escalates through protagonist agency under the Causal lens, as each clue narrows options and deepens knowledge. Cost is legible when Elara's creation of transformative jewelry forecloses her mourning path, with a visible price in her shifted focus to helping others.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and renewal emerges through particulars like the rose stencil and constellations, with subtext in gesture and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "grief was not a full stop, but a comma," avoiding moralizing and arising from earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent in Elara's biased noticing. Dialogue, though minimal, feels natural and goal-driven, as in the woman's whisper, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "subdued ardor burning steadily" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami clues, and observatory setting feels organic and inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in the mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image recharges prior material with authenticity.</comment>
