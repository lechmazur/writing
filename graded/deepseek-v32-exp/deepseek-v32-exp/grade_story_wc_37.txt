<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her struggle, but internal contradiction lacks depth in pivotal beats, slightly reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost under the accumulative lens; the mica window and songs persistently shape tactics, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the alchemical orchard greenhouse and mica window constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory detail and POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in singing and swaddling light, with cost legible as the realm transitions from brink to release under accumulative pressure, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through memory and community emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in songs and light, but edges toward overtness in the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature that reflects Elara's scattered mind; rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; figurative language enhances clarity without muddle, and peak beats maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, song, and light in a dying realm, with risk in accumulative design, but echoes familiar fantasy tropes without full transformation.</comment>
