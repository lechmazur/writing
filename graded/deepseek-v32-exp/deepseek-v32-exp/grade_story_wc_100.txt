<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elijah's weariness and stubbornness are embodied and drive key choices; his motivation to give rest a permanent address intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned resolution where his patience aligns the lens. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like trembling hands under stress revealing hierarchy of values. The final satisfaction feels earned by prior causality, though minor telling in emotional states slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident to closure; package arrival sparks investigation, research reveals lens function, and climax in impossible space delivers decisive change with cost—stillness achieved and souls freed. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands on-page with felt cost in the profound silence and Elijah's lifted weariness. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; structure is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Settings are vividly specific and pressure choices: the sodden crate, battered submersible, and coral-encrusted library constrain tactics and charge the final image where moonlight creates an impossible space. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like water pressing like a "thick, dark quilt." The lens and library recur with reweighted meaning, meeting the 9+ test by shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of giving rest a permanent address escalates through Elijah's agency under causal lens: journey to coast, submersible descent, and lens repair each narrow options and deepen knowledge. Cost is legible in his days of research and trembling hands, culminating in a trade-off that forecloses other paths. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though the distress signals' introduction could be earlier for fuller integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of using the broken to make whole emerges organically from events and images, not statement; the lens's transformation from cracked to radiant offers a non-literal answer to permanence and rest. Subtext operates in gestures like aligning prisms with undertaker's patience, and the final pulse of "arrival" reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, weary voice; perceptual signature is selective, noticing "salt-stained" crate and "ghost" pages. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, compressing under stress ("his breath bubbling in the cold"). No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is absent, so evaluated on internal coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language like "water pressing in like a thick, dark quilt" is coherent and voice-motivated. No template cadence or synonym churn; closure image is sharp and undulled by artifacts. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undertaker, lighthouse lens, and underwater library feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details like ethereal distress signals. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors universals. Fresh inflection in the "impossible space" method charges the closure, resisting middle-ground hedging.</comment>
