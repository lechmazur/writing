<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as following the musical notes. Her internal conflict is shown through sensory absorption and grief transformation, earning the closure. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in her acceptance. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres through sensory accumulation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and compass ring constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory detail integrated into action. Setting pressures tactics, such as the ring pulsing to guide her path, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating grief) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases in sensory trails and agency in dowsing. Cost is legible in the transformation of grief, and escalation is driven by protagonist choices, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and calm emerges through events and imagery, not direct statement, with subtext in the forest's language and the stillpoint. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical prose, and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., sensory absorption) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and poetic rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, with no artifacts harming closure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of unique elements (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest) transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable with organic integration.</comment>
