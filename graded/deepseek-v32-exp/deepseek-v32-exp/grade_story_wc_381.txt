<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in "tranquil blaze of determination," but lacks internal contradiction or significant change under pressure, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with cost in "profound relief" and restored balance; accumulative/textural lens holds with clear causality from ritual to hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "brook's gentle flow" and "starlit sky" integrate with action; the crane's wing as micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation driven by Elian's agency in mapping silence, with cost legible in the "growing silence" and his determination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of balance emerges through images like "smoothed hush" and "terrestrially cosmic"; ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with poetic voice; perceptual signature in tracing "silence's intricate pathways" and consistent rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in repeated "terrestrially cosmic" and "smoothed hush" slightly reduces density without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of summoner and origami elements with specific details; transformation of silence motif feels organic, though not highly risky.</comment>
