<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; the final action is earned but without significant personal cost, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an accumulative/textural lens, as mirages fade with cost of transience legible in "before fading back into reflection"; orientation is early and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the prism parapet constraining choices by guiding light and charging the final image; specificity is high and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency through humming and light guidance, tightening stakes under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the fading mirages, but escalation is gentle without foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities and transience emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing; subtext is strong in lullabies and light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and elision is purposeful with rhythm control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language is coherent and advances the story without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of mirage painter using coded lullabies is fresh and specific, with synthesis feeling inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
