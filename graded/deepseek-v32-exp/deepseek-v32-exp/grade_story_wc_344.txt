<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her quest with concrete interiority like "driftwood nostalgia." Her micro-choices, such as using the gear to uncap the vial, reveal values under pressure, and the final understanding is earned through prior causality. However, contradictory impulses are minimal, and the emotional progression lacks deep irrationality, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara uncaps the vial and gains understanding, reconfiguring her stance with cost legible in "driftwood nostalgia softened into acceptance." The causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of the prophecy and gears shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the frozen library and hall of mirrors constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "frost clung to parchment." The environment pressures tactics, such as using the gear in the mirror frame, and the glacial blue shelves reinforce tone without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from searching prophecies to uncapping the vial, narrowing options with cost in her emotional shift. The dominant stake of learning repair rhythm tightens meaningfully, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the mirrors showing "lost moments" and the realization that repair aligns with cycles, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in implication, like the light whispering secrets, without moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature filtering details through Elara's bias, like "gleaming like tiny metal stars." Rhythm and syntax control under pressure are strong, though minor register consistency issues in peaks prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language, but slight overwriting in phrases like "hauntingly bright in their vivid, sorrowful clarity" causes minor density issues. No loops or scaffolds harm closure, and propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like lunar-eclipse locksmith and frozen library, transformed with specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric resonance pays off, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, though it leans on familiar quest tropes without full subversion.</comment>
