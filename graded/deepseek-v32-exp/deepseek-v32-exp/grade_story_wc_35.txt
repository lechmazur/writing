<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Kaelen transforms stored remorse, carrying felt cost through his trembling and the pavilion's sigh. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with emotional patterns intensifying to the climax. Orientation is clear early, establishing who, where, and when without disorientation. Causality is smooth, with each beat building toward the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details, like the damp ramparts and coral pavilion, filtered through Kaelen's POV. The environment constrains choices, such as the emotionally contagious touch of the coral, and charges the final image of the glimmering pavilion. Spatial choreography is coherent, with puddles and dunes mirroring emotional residue. Specificity enhances atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—subsuming remorse—escalates through Kaelen's agency, as he actively draws emotions into himself despite the cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with emotional weight intensifying until the climax. The cost is legible in his trembling and the thick air of shared sorrow. A meaningful tightening occurs when he touches the central pillar, forcing a trade-off between absorption and self-loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as tasting memories and sandpapering rough edges, without direct statement.
