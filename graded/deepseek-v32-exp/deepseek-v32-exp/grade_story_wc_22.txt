<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, driving deliberate actions, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses or deep internal conflict, rendering the coachman somewhat one-dimensional under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the garden begins reclaiming the battlefield, cost is felt in the labor and memory, and the accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the jetty and twilight constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and submerged concord emerges organically through images and actions, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in whispers and bird guidance.</comment>
