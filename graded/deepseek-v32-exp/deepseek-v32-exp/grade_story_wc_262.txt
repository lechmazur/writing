<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices; however, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final commitment, while earned, lacks intense conflicting impulses during the vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elara's resolve crystallizes; the accumulative lens holds, with the spatial realm reconfiguring meaning; orientation is clear early, and the constraint of unused love shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image; the projection booth and nebulous realm constrain perception and action, with sensory detail filtered through Elara's spatial imagination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through Elara's agency in the vision; under the accumulative lens, density increases reweight the cost of her new purpose, though the turn is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unused love emerges organically through images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the melody and promise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with Elara's spatially imaginative perception shaping syntax and rhythm; no head-hopping, and elision in the realm sequence is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion, but slight overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "nebulous realm where emotions took on tangible form") causes minor muddle without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes crystal gazing and psychometry with fresh specificity; the reservoir of love as crystals feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes.</comment>
