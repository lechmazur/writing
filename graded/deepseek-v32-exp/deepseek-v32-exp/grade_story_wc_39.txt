<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied emotion; the poet's internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as jarring sounds and humming to sweeten them, reveal a hierarchy of values. His transformation from vagrant to keeper feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his redemption. However, the "positively wistful" attribute leans slightly label-like without deeply constraining choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (gleaned redemption) under an accumulative/textural lens, felt cost in the poet's personal shift. The structure is coherent with a single scene, and orientation is clear early. However, the persistent constraint of sound-capturing method doesn't fully shape tactics, capping the score just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the feral loft and music box charging the final image through POV-filtered details like "salt-crusted air" and "woven sea grass." The environment subtly mirrors internal states but doesn't strongly pressure choices, preventing a 9+ score despite its atmospheric richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes around preservation and redemption escalate through the poet's agency in capturing sounds, with cost legible in his emotional weight and transformation. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the conflict remains internal without external pressure, limiting higher escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through memory emerges organically from actions and images, such as jarred sounds as "a dialect of memory and hope," with a non-literal, resonant ending. Subtext in the poet's past as a bard enriches complexity, but the concept isn't fully repriced with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure; the perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., past regrets) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift, meeting the 9+ test for lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "choir of silenced voices" is purposeful and clear. Minor overwriting in phrases like "lonesome splendor" doesn't harm closure, but prevents a 9.5+ due to slight decorative elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of sound-capturing and redemption, feeling inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept is transformed through specific details, but close echoes of common literary tropes limit uniqueness.</comment>
