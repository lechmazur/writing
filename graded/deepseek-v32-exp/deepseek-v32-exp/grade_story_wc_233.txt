<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like shedding robes and defying fear during the climb. The final shift to guardian is earned by prior causality, though some interiority leans slightly told, such as "weight of her crown feeling like a cage," which is effective but not deeply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara embraces her duty, cost legible in "weight of revelation settling on her shoulders." Causal lens holds strong from dreams to grotto revelation, with orientation anchored early and no breaks in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the cobalt grotto and ember grotto constraining choice and charging the final image. Specific details like "clouds swirled below" and "shimmering with deep blue hue" are purposeful, though spatial choreography in the climb could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling dreams escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, with cost unmistakable in the celestial collapse revelation. The climb and grotto entry tighten options meaningfully, though the guardian's brief appearance adds minor pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic duty emerges organically through images like bleeding starlight and fireflies, with a resonant, non-literal answer in Elara's renewed purpose. Subtext in "lacy menace" and vision avoids moralizing, earning complexity through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Elara's lyrical observations and rhythmic prose under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision like the guardian's departure is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "bleeding starlight" is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, and read-aloud rhythm is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fantasy tropes with cosmic stakes feels inevitable, transformed through Elara's specific journey and emotional truth. Risk-taking in scale and tone heightens stakes, though it echoes familiar archetypes.</comment>
