<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving his exploration and interpretation. His skepticism and reverence are embodied under pressure, with micro-choices like using the radio revealing character. The final understanding is earned through causality, with cost felt in the release of the secret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Kaelen's realization and symbolic act, reconfiguring the ghost shift as trauma under a causal lens. Cost is legible in the "weight no longer swallowed" and the tunnel's lifted heaviness. Orientation is clear early, and linkages are tight without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the "crumbling bricks" and "cold air," constraining choices and charging the final image with the valve wheel's reprise. The tunnel and object function as micro-setting, integrated into action and theme without generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kaelen's agency in discovering the valve and interpreting the radio confession, tightening under causal pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the "profound hush" and relief, foreclosing options with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth and regret emerges organically from events, with subtext in the ghost shift as collective trauma. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the realization, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in descriptive prose and radio dialogue that advances plot. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision in the confession payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of ghost shift as auditory imprint and radio interpretation method, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
