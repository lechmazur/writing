<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the narrator's motivation to learn the language of buildings is clear and intensifies, culminating in an earned renunciation when the ghost departs, foreclosing the path with visible cost. Professor Finch's spectral nature and the "agreed upon lies" are handled with consistent traits and emotional complexity, though his acceptance feels slightly smooth, it is mitigated by the mystical familiarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens, building through imagery and emotional resonance to a closure that is a conceptual repricing—the ghost's departure and transfer of the seal reconfigures the narrator's understanding of communication with the dead, with cost legible in the dissolution. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with one meaningful tightening at the direct interrogation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the rooftop garden and meteor shower creating a sensory-rich atmosphere that pressures choices and charges the final image; the antique seal functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and deepens the closure, integrated through POV bias without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Conflict escalates under the accumulative lens through increased density and a key turn when the narrator interrogates the ghost, forcing a stance crystallization with agency; the dominant stake of learning the language is tested, and the cost of loss is felt on-page, though the escalation is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of communication between living and dead emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the "agreed upon lies"; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final image of the seal and silent conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a stable first-person POV and perceptual signature that filters setting and emotion; prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the ghost's nature) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh premise synthesizing ghostly tutelage and architectural language; tropes are transformed through specific details and emotional truth, and risk-taking in the mystical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
