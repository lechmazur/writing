<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like clutching the dice and using proofs. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, but the epiphany leans slightly tidy, though cost is visible in the acceptance of finite quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elara reconfigures her pursuit into acceptance, under the accumulative/textural lens. The staircase and dice persist as constraints, and orientation is clear early. The rupture revelation is decisive and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite staircase and chipped dice function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with proofs and dice rolls deepening pressure. Cost is legible when she forecloses endless pursuit for acceptance, driven by her balanced daring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the dice and staircase, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end: life's texture is imperfect. Subtext operates through images, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature in Elara's poetic introspection. Rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision (e.g., mathematical proofs) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or artifacts. Minor density in figurative language doesn't obscure closure, and propulsion remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of mathematical proofs and metaphysical quest, transformed through specific details like the chipped die. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
