<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration and felt cost as Elara reads the letters and makes peace; the causal chain from the whale beaching to the excavation is tight, and the hybrid drive lens holds with gravity as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and no plot breaks harm escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the salt chamber and gravity pockets constraining choices and charging the final image as a "cathedral for her sorrow"; sensory details like "chime of tiny falling shards" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elara's agency under the hybrid lens, with gravity fluctuations and excavation raising costs; the resolution is earned by her renunciation and endurance, foreclosing paths with emotional cost legible in the peace-making.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the buried jar and wildflowers offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and loss; subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing, though the line "deleted memories don't go anywhere" leans explicit.</comment>
