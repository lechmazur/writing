<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her quest with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as seeking candor to revive the leaves. However, interior contradiction is not strongly dramatized in simultaneous impulses, limiting the 9+ threshold. The final renunciation of mere discovery for preservation feels earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing as Aria realizes lost conversations are stored and her purpose shifts to preservation, with cost legible in the renewed glow of the leaves. The causal drive lens holds tightly from map discovery to archive activation, and orientation is anchored early within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky pressure choices through environmental constraints, while the leaves and archive as micro-settings charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Aria's POV, with the setting actively shaping tactics like seeking candor in decaying sectors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the causal lens, as lies wilt the leaves and force her to seek candor, narrowing options and raising the cost of truth. The dominant stake of preserving lost conversations tightens through the journey, with a visible price in the talismans' reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between truth and deception, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the archive's echoes and Aria's renewed purpose. Subtext operates in the leaves' wilting and the child's secret, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Aria's calligraphic sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in the closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, as with the child's secret.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "strained breath of filtered air," and syntax varies to support momentum without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligrapher, wilting leaves, and postal archive feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
