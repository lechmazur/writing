<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final decision to play the fiddle is earned by prior causality, foreclosing despair with visible cost. However, minor stock phrasing in epiphanies (e.g., "cosmic truth") slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (haunted to illuminated), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. The glass flake and flutters act as persistent constraints, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the ending reweights meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the pullout's fluttering fabric and light patterns directly enable Elias's insight. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with spatial choreography coherent. Environment evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency through density increase (observations leading to realization). Cost is legible in the transformation from confusion to wonder. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, though pressure coheres without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (e.g., glass flake, flutters) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "open doors," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in dynamic observation. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "scaffold wrap flutters") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and serves pressure, though minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "luminous disbelief") slightly reduces clarity. Propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis (e.g., pixelated amnesty, bridge-songs) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates. Transformation test passed.</comment>
