<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lorian's motivation is clear and fiercely consistent, driving all actions; his diminutive stature contrasts with immense duty, embodied in precise micro-choices like tracing book spines. Interiority is concrete without stock phrasing, and his final activation of the rune is earned by prior persistence. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatlining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Theron's power fades "like sand through fingers"; causal lens holds tightly from messages to confrontation. Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when; no disorientation or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—library shelves "curved like sleeping dragons"—and actively pressures choices as sanctuary and weapon. The iron gall ink and rune of drift constrains tactics and charges the final image, with sensory details like "scent of aged paper and iron" woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmasking the pretender escalates under causal lens through Lorian's agency, from planting messages to activating the rune. Cost is unmistakable in Theron's collapse, narrowing options and reweighting stakes with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deception emerges organically through the rune of drift and Lorian's patience, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "only what was true remained." No moralizing; subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with poetic perceptual signature ("weight of epochs in his eyes") and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven in the climax; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language like "ink blooming like a night flower" is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of classic usurper trope through specific elements like diminutive titan and rune of drift, transforming it with a focus on patience over force. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
