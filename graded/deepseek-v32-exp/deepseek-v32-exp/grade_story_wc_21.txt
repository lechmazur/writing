<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like arranging debris and parleying. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "heart pounding with tension." The final resolve to share the truth is earned through prior causality, though her solemnity remains somewhat one-dimensional without deeper internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: Elara returns with decrypted diary and renewed mission, cost legible in "the weight of it settled on her shoulders." Causal lens holds tightly from touch to vision to unlocking. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the retrocognitive trap persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Settings like the obsidian lagoon and floating library are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices—the lagoon is where debris arrangement unlocks the past. Sensory details ("grains of sand," "black glass") are selective and POV-filtered. The diary as a micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates under causal lens through Elara's agency in arranging debris and parleying. Cost is unmistakable in her burden and peace. One meaningful tightening occurs as each arrangement brings her closer, foreclosing comfort for confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus comfort emerges organically from events and subtext, e.g., "some truths are too painful to bear." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's resolve without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct, solemn perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., the woman's echoing voice. Voice coherence holds under pressure, and elision (e.g., vision transition) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled, e.g., "lagoon's surface shimmered," and clarity persists in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of civil-rights archival work with retrocognitive elements feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like beach debris as cipher transform tropes. Risk-taking in supernatural historical uncovering heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
