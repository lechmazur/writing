<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in "old, troubling serenity" and "peculiar grief." However, internal conflict is more reflective than dramatized in scene, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis with felt cost in the final hope and sorrow; Accumulative lens holds through pattern repetition. Orientation is clear early, and the calculating machine gear shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the nebula garden and calculating machine gear constraining choices and charging the final image through their integral role in seeding decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear in the cycle of civilization failure; escalation is driven by the Keeper's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in emotional toll, though it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in hope vs. inevitability; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with stable POV; perceptual signature is strong in the Keeper's cosmic observations, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cyclical failure and cosmic stewardship, transformed through specific details like the calculating gear; risk-taking in quiet tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
