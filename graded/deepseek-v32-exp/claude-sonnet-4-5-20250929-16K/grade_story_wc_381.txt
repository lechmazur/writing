<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "her legs stiff from kneeling." The summoner's competence and determination drive the narrative, and her final smile indicates earned stasis. However, lack of contradictory impulses or deep flaws limits complexity, though it fits the short scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the wing crumbling and the prophecy hushed, demonstrating a resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens. Cost is legible in her effort and the forest's changed state. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens meaningfully with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric with sensory details like "cricket songs" and "cool night air," integrating well with the character's actions. The brook serves as an anchor but doesn't heavily constrain choices, preventing a higher score despite its purposeful use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly signaled, with escalation driven by the summoner's agency in gathering the prophecy's instances. Cost is unmistakable in her prolonged effort and the wing's dissolution. Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as silence as salvation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "ignorance... truest form of salvation," reweighting prior material meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet consistent voice that reflects the summoner's perception. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports pressure, and elision (e.g., her trance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with high information density, varying sentence structures, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "whispered secrets that filtered through the darkness like smoke through silk" enhances without muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, subverting prophecy tropes through unique elements like mapping silence and the origami wing. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in method and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
