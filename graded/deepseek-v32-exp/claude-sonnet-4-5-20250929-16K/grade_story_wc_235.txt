<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of jealousy and awe, with embodied emotions like "the familiar bite of jealousy" and micro-choices under pressure, such as continuing to write despite time confusion, earning the closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the final image of Mara picking up another scroll, reconfiguring meaning under an accumulative/textural lens; the persistent constraint of time confusion shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the birch bark scroll and cabin environment constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "pine sap and old smoke" are filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency to distill chaos, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her "jaded wonder"; the dominant stake of making sense of time tightens through her continued writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the grave and soaring dreams, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control, e.g., "Time had become a tangled fishing line"; POV is stable and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language like "jaded wonder" is coherent and voice-motivated, without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes lucid dreaming and time confusion into a fresh, inevitable premise; risk-taking in non-linear narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
