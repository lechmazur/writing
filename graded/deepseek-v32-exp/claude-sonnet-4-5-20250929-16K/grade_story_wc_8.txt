<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Helena's emotionally rational trait is consistently shown through micro-choices, such as her balanced response to injustice, and her final decision to publish is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The closure choice forecloses her career path with felt cost, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—Helena's commitment to publish—and cost is legible in "her career at the state archives would end." The causal drive lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of censorship shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the ivy-strangled station and rosebush's final petal charging the final image by mirroring endings and beginnings. Sensory details are purposefully filtered through Helena's historian POV. The rosebush as a recurring object reweights the stake at closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Helena's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the letter to drawing parallels and deciding to act. The dominant stake of truth versus censorship tightens meaningfully, with cost unmistakable in her career sacrifice. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically from events and parallels, without direct statement, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Helena's realization. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, though the final line slightly verges on explicit moralizing without fully undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Helena's historian mindset through selective attention to endings. Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural flow, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes historical and modern censorship with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight through grounded character choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, but risk-taking is moderate, lacking highly unconventional elements. Fresh inflection in the parallel concept elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
