<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the wick and logging observations. Her motivation to steer ships using ancient techniques is clear and consistent, culminating in an earned endurance with cost in isolation. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara continues her duty, cost legible in the unread logbook and prophetic weight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of light and prophecy building to a final image of "ancient light shaping everything new." Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. Specificity is high, such as the lens cleaning and stellar alignments, reflecting Mara's professional priorities without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in the ritual and storm intensity, with cost legible in her isolation and the ships' course changes. The dominant stake of guiding ships tightens through the beam's pulsing and prophetic utterances, though no major reversal occurs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tradition versus modernity emerges through concrete particulars like the glass wick and unread logs, with subtext in Mara's laughter. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "ancient light shaping everything new," avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature, such as "shadowed elation." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "the beam shot forth, not just illuminating but somehow pulling," and elision (e.g., predecessor's disappearance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "photon finding its own infinite path," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the storm sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of a steering lighthouse, prophetic herald, and glass wick mechanics, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in magical realism elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
