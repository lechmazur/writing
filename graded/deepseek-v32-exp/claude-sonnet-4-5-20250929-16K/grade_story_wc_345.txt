<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirela's altruism is consistently motivated and embodied through her actions, with micro-choices under pressure driving the plot. Kess's mini-arc demonstrates credible emotional progression, though secondary characters are less developed. The final renunciation ("I CAN REST NOW") is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from messages to community change. Closure is a decisive change (community unification) with felt cost (Mirela's essence thinning). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or convenience undermines causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., low gravity affects watering, arches shape the environment). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The butterfly bell and orchard planet charge the final image, integrating setting with theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) escalates through Mirela's agency and the merchant ship threat. Cost is legible in Mirela's effort and the community's trade-off. One meaningful tightening (vote refusal) forecloses options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective vs. individual emerges through events and images, not statement. Subtext in chalk messages and final image offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity arises from particulars like Kess's hoarding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mirela, with distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue (e.g., Kess's speech) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language ("droplets that hung suspended like tears") is coherent and pressure-appropriate. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost, refugee settlement, and collective action feels inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific details (e.g., chalk messages, butterfly bell). Risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
