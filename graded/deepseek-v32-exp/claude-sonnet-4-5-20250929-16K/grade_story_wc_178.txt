<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's frugality and devotion are embodied through concrete actions like counting candle stubs, and her motivation to bridge cosmic truth intensifies under pressure, compelling her to uncloak the tile's meaning. The final choice to carry the covenant forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in political dissolution. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is shown through her meticulous work against scarcity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through Mara's discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where she recognizes the eternal covenant. Orientation is clear early with palace and violet hour. Closure lands with cost in "carried forward, one more link in a chain of stargazers," and the political constraint shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks; the tile's revelation tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with salvaged solar panels and reclaimed stone, constraining choices as both observatory and sanctuary. The tile as micro-setting charges the final image when carried in the satchel. Sensory details like candlelight and amber glow are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with terraces and chambers guiding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sealing a covenant with the unknown escalates under Accumulative lens through Mara's agency in deciphering the tile, uncloaking layers that deepen knowledge. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the foreclosed path of political uncertainty. One meaningful tightening occurs as the square's perspective shifts options, driven by her schematic work without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of devotion transcending time emerges implicitly from Mara's realization that observation and devotion are synonymous, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of carrying the tile, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in the encrypted message as love for the cosmos, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Mara's astronomical expertise, evident in phrases like "celestial coordinates." Voice is controlled and poetic, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in the tile's discovery is taught and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but internal texture remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "dusky harmony" is purposeful and clear. No register drift or overwriting; closure image is sharp with "morning star appeared above the terraces." Proofreading is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ancient astronomy and post-collapse setting feels inevitable, with encrypted devotion transforming the trope through specific details like the magic square. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in Mara's journey avoids template plots; the closure reconfigures meaning with freshness.</comment>
