<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's characterization is deeply nuanced, with her internal conflict between keeping and releasing secrets embodied through specific actions like tying letters to the spiral. Her final choice to teach Jun is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her relinquishment of control. The relationship with Jun applies subtle pressure, reinforcing her arc without overshadowing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mei Lin's realization that her work is about release, not preservation. The Accumulative lens holds strongly, building through image patterns like the letters and spiral. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the storm-incited installation drives coherent escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly rendered, with sensory details like "water dripping from the temple eaves" filtering through Mei Lin's perspective. The thrush's nest installation constrains her choice to add letters, charging the final image as a tangible expression of human connection. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of Mei Lin's internal conflict escalates under the Accumulative lens through her decision to release the letters, narrowing her options and altering community dynamics. Cost is legible in her transformed understanding of her role. Agency drives the tightening, with the installation serving as a catalyst but not a coincidental resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection and release emerges organically through particulars like the letters and reconciliations, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the image of the thrush recognizing "human longing," reweighting prior motifs. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Jun's quiet help and the visitors' weeping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with Mei Lin's poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "words scattering prismatic reflections." Voice modulates under pressure, retaining distinct rhythm and diction. Dialogue, though sparse, carries subtext and advances plot, as in Jun's admission about writing his own letter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "like a jewel emerging from silk," is coherent and purposeful. Rhythm supports momentum, and the final image of bells "fracturing into crystalline notes" lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of love letter ghostwriting and the art installation feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details like the categorized letters. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, as in the widow's letter tied to the spiral.</comment>
