<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her past trauma, driving her actions consistently. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown in her reverence for objects and community focus. The final choice to help Iris is earned by prior causality, and the cost is felt in Iris's emotional release. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like her need to heal others are balanced with competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from locket discovery to resolution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Iris begins healing, with cost legible in her sobbing and inclusion. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of the courtyard community shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the courtyard acting as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "bougainvillea the color of fresh wounds." Spatial choreography is coherent; details evolve with the narrative, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing grief through community escalates under causal lens via Maya's agency in investigating and confronting Iris. Cost is unmistakable in Iris's raw sobbing and the mailbox scene. One meaningful tightening occurs as Maya's listening leads to the climax, foreclosing Iris's isolation with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing through listening emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like Iris's silence and the community's inclusion. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Iris hearing others "like plants hear rain," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "sandstorm calm" reflecting Maya's mindset. Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in Iris's whispered confession. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "pain was a sandstorm," and doesn't muddle peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained throughout closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of thrift-store curation, locked mystery, and community healing, transformed through specific details like the locket key. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
