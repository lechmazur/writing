<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final decision to encode messages is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her isolation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: her voice finds an audience and the ghost coheres, with felt cost in the shared articulation. The causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from discovery to action. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of the monastery's mechanisms shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the courtyard and prayer-wheels guiding action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The flower press bolt plate and graffiti art function as micro-settings that alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with a meaningful tightening as she encodes messages to articulate needs. The cost is legible in her frenzied effort and the ghost's coherence. Dominant stake in giving voice to the voiceless is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in the ghost's nature and the encoding process. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to communication and memory without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the farmer's hope and child's longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression in high-tempo beats. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language serves the moment without muddle, though minor overwriting in peaks prevents a higher score. No loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes technology and mysticism in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
