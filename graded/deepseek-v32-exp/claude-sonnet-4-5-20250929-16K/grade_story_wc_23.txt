<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing maps and using the censer foot. Her internal conflict between hope and grief is shown through concrete actions, and her endurance feels earned. The final stance of waiting charges the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Mara's pressed forehead against the window, underscoring her enduring hope. The accumulative lens holds, building through phone calls and moon phases. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the broken hydraulics limit her methods, and the bronze censer foot charges the final image. Sensory details like the "waning crescent" and "warm stone" are filtered through Mara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the reverse migration and approaching new moon, driven by Mara's agency in guiding callers. The cost of her personal loss is legible in the closure, and pressure tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loss and return emerges organically through images like the censer foot and "geography of loss," offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and objects, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "stitching together what remained." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and elision (e.g., cryptic calls) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language like "thin as a fingernail scraping the sky" is purposeful. Momentum is sustained through to the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of patchwork navigation and reverse migration feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the bronze censer foot. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
