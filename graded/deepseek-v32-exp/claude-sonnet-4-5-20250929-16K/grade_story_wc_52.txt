<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits of grief and practicality, with interiority shown through specific, embodied actions like feeling the wood's weight. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as the first cut, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the transformation of loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira's acceptance reweights meaning; cost is legible in the final image of the carved figure joining others. Orientation is clear early, and the structure builds through sensory and reflective density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the rain-beaded skylight and ash wood constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like the kettle's whisper are filtered through Mira's POV, integrating environment with internal state to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mira's agency in carving, with a meaningful tightening as she commits to the form; cost is unmistakable in the emotional trade-off between grief and peace, foreclosing other paths of mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges organically through concrete actions and images, such as the carving of moments, without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the figure in ash and memory, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., memories) is taught and paid off in closure, enhancing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "crystallized time" is integrated and clear, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of grief through carving crystallized time, transforming tropes with specific, grounded details; risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
