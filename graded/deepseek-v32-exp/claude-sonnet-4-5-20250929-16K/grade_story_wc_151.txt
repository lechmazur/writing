<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her backstory and embodied in micro-choices like tracing chalk and smearing codes. Interiority is concrete, but lacks strong contradictory impulses under pressure, though endurance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring stakes through Maya's continued work, with cost felt in the risk and meaning preserved. Causal lens holds, orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the golden arcade constraining choices (e.g., decoding and erasing codes) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Maya's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in preserving human mystery escalates through Maya's agency in decoding, sending letters, and continuing work. Cost is legible in the risk and meaning, with one meaningful tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of futuristic nostalgia emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in actions like smearing chalk. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is consistent and purposeful, with natural dialogue. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., decoding) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and character, and figurative language is coherent, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, synthesizing dystopian resistance with nostalgic detail. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
