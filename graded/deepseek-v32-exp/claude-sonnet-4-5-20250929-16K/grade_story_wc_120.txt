<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority rendered through specific memories and embodied emotion. Her chronological homesickness drives micro-choices under pressure, and the final endurance against exhaustion is earned by prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions like homesick-yet-productive add depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "exhaustion finally hit" and the dissolved symmetry. Orientation is clear within 120 words; single-scene structure tightens meaningfully through memory density and raced writing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (glass spire chosen for mirrored horizon) and charges the final image ("frozen lake" to "clearly lake"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with the nautilus shell acting as micro-setting that shapes tactics. No generic placeholder; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (writing before exhaustion) escalates under accumulative lens through density of memories and raced writing. Agency drives tightening; cost is visible in exhaustion and foreclosed dawn window. No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images (nautilus as spiral of time) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through fortunes as "translation of homesickness." Subtext in gestures like shell imprinting; no thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("time moved like honey"). Voice is poetic yet controlled; no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., memory surges) is taught and pays off in closure. Diction matches POV's reflective tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; no register drift. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fortune-writing with memory archaeology feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific details (nautilus shell, glass spire). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative premise.</comment>
