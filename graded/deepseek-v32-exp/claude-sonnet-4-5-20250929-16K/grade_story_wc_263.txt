<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and consistent, rooted in her established sensitivity to unspoken words. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the "pulse of unspoken words" and hearing screams, which avoids stock phrasing. Her final choice to become the doorway is earned by prior causality, including her grandmother's teachings and her lifelong struggle, with visible cost in her resting. Minor lack of internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Lyra resting after becoming the doorway, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reconfigures options with felt cost. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of falling stars and aurora intensification builds coherently to the climax. Causality is tight, with orientation anchored early, and the astrolabe's use shapes tactics. Persistent constraints like the archway and instrument charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "cold granite" and "liquid revelation," selectively filtered through Lyra's POV. The aurora-lit archway constrains choices and supplies resources, directly affecting the outcome by being the focal point for the portal. Atmosphere supports the theme of creativity, and spatial choreography is clear. The environment charges the final image, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing trapped creativity is signaled early and escalates through Lyra's agency under the Accumulative lens, as meteor paths intensify and narrow options. Cost is legible in her resting, demonstrating a trade-off after the creativity spill. Escalation is driven by her actions, such as tracing stars and aligning the astrolabe, with no coincidence resolving conflict. One meaningful tightening forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unexpressed creativity emerges organically from events and images, such as the "unspoken words" and stardust memory, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lyra becoming the doorway, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in implication, like the aurora's approval, and avoids tidy resolutions. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through the final image of rain-like creativity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Lyra's perceptual signature, such as noticing "languages no one remembered." Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, e.g., short sentences during climax. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision; purposeful compression in celestial patterns is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Lyra's plausible lexicon, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "shadowed rapture" are consistent and purposeful. Syntax propels momentum, especially in peak beats, and clarity is maintained. Minor overwriting in dense imagery is balanced by strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of hearing unspoken words and freeing creativity, transformed via specific details like the astrolabe and aurora. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the premise is fully committed to. No derivative echoes or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
