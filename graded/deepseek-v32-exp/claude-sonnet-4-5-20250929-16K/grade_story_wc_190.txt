<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as touching the storm glass and guiding the young man without words. Her motivation to teach silence comfort is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies through the interaction. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the young man's grief is somewhat generic, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara's reflection on transits reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the storm glass as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of crystals reforming like grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as sound behaving differently and light moving like slow water. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the interaction with the young man, deepening the stake of emotional healing. Mara's agency in guiding him and his resulting slowed breathing show cost legibly. However, the escalation is subtle, lacking a sharp turn, which limits the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and silence emerges organically through images and events, such as the storm glass and train whistle echo, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the line "teaching silence its forgotten purpose." Subtext operates in gestures and implications, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mara's voice is lyrical and consistent, reflecting her professional focus. Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional pressure, as in the description of the terrace expanding after the whistle. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "air held memories of noise like water holds salt," is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of grief work with a surreal setting, transforming tropes through specific details like the storm glass and noise monitoring. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in the quiet, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
