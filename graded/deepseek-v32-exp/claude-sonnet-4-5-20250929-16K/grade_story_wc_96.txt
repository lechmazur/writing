<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solomon's motivation to forge beauty from anarchy is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like deciding to stop shedding personalities. His internal conflict between survival and stability is earned, and the final choice carries visible cost in foreclosing his old identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Solomon decides to stay Solomon and the library transforms, with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure moves from past to present seamlessly, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library setting constrains choices (e.g., using card catalogs for planting) and charges the final image with sensory specificity. Vivid details like "vines claiming the corners" are filtered through Solomon's POV and support the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with stakes in personal and communal rebuilding tightening through actions like planting seeds and reciting poems. Cost is legible in Solomon's renunciation of identity shedding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from anarchy emerges through particulars like the library's transformation and Solomon's arc, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "broken things grow toward light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, and dialogue between Solomon and Marcus feels natural and goal-driven. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression in lyrical moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "molts personalities monthly" is taught early and pays off, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of vagrant poet and community rebuilding feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in lyrical compression heightening stakes. Specific details like the coffee tin's false bottom transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
