<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's pacifism and perceptive nature are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as pressing canvas scraps with intention. Her father's shift from armed tension to kneeling is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his sheathing gesture. Internal contradictions act in scene, e.g., Mara's tension versus her cultivated calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the father sheathes his knife, reconfiguring their relationship with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds, driven by atmospheric pressure and Mara's steadfastness. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the dome's constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the ending, with roses leaning away from violence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "dust-caked" father versus "amber sanctuary." Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect Mara's POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace versus violence) escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase, e.g., roses curling from restlessness. Protagonist agency drives escalation via Mara's dialogue and actions, leading to the father's renunciation with cost legible in his sheathing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weaving continuity through chaos emerges from particulars like salvaged canvas and the sheathing action, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared planting. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., the knife's whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "taste tomorrow's dust storm." Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation in high-pressure beats. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, e.g., "You shouldn't have come."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "like a held breath." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of inculcating plants with values is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like ballast canvas. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
