<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to certify wonder is clear and rooted in his traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, no internal contradiction or flaws complicate his actions, limiting depth. The final choice is earned through prior causality, but the cost is implied rather than visible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the unfettering releasing wonder, felt cost in the world's change. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the aurora's pulsing. Persistent constraint of timing with the sculptor's chisel shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice cavern setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices as Kael navigates bells and uses the environment in the ritual. The aurora and bells charge the final image, with details filtered through Kael's synesthetic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of certifying wonder escalates under accumulative lens through Kael's agency in the ritual timing. Cost is legible in the synchronized effort and the unfettering's impact. One meaningful tightening occurs as chisel meets stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as necessity emerges organically through events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the unfettering, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature via synesthesia; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., timing mechanism) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements freshly with specificity; risk-taking in conceptual frame heightens stakes. The sculpted hush and unfettering feel inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
