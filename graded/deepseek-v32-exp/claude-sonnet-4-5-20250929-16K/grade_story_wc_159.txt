<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's motivation is clear and rooted in her role; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "foxglove regret." Micro-choices under pressure, such as using the phonograph and crafting a new chime, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the blend of purpose and sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "purpose mixed with sorrow." Orientation is clear within 120 words. The cracked tube creates a new frequency, and the solution arises from established pattern without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—the opal library's atmosphere and the orchids' resonance constrain Miren's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "opal light" and "glass petals." The environment charges the final image, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving orchids) escalates under accumulative lens through Miren's agency—discovering the broken chime, using recordings, and creating a new chime. Cost is legible in the emotional weight and the shattered orchid used for repair. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preserving lost emotions emerges organically from particulars like the orchids and recordings, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "love directed toward ghosts." Subtext operates in the interplay between regret and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "crystallized emotions from the museum of extinct feelings." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, and rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "opal light of the floating library." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative texture without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific—library of extinct feelings—synthesized with character and stakes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens meaning without gimmickry. The transformation of the cracked tube into a new frequency feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
