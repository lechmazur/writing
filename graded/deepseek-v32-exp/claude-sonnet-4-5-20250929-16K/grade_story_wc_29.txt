<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotions (e.g., teeth aching from frequencies). Her final choice to interfere is earned by prior causality, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (signals stop, chanting ceases) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and Jupiter's alignment amplifies the resolution, making the ending legible and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (e.g., basement studio with ozone smell, astronomical charts), constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from community division to her interference; cost is unmistakable in the on-page battle and its aftermath, tightening stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of free will vs. manipulation emerges organically through events and subtext (e.g., tricksters amplifying discord), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer, though it leans slightly straightforward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending scientific observation and poetic nuance (e.g., "whisper of stars"); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or muddle; figurative language (e.g., "waveforms danced") serves clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic manipulation and human resistance, with specific details (e.g., subsonic frequencies) feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
