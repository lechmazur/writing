<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply integrated with her deafness and profession, driving motivated choices like descending into the cavern and using backward music. Her internal conflict—numbness versus seeking vibration—is embodied in micro-choices, and her final guidance of students earns closure through prior causality. The deaf music teacher premise avoids stock traits, with emotions filtered through tactile perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the broken needle's shadow "pulsing" and the cavern's resurrection reconfigure silence as presence with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of hush and vibration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality tightens from Mira's experiments to student transformations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cavern functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—heavy fabrics absorb echoes, enabling the backward music's effect—and charges the final image of "resurrection." Sensory details (e.g., "trailing along walls," "light filtering") are selective and POV-filtered, with the body as a tactile instrument for vibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) escalates under Accumulative lens through Mira's agency: her experimentation with the phonograph and student sessions deepen pressure. Cost is legible in the "terrible numbness" yielding to "resurrection," foreclosing isolation. One meaningful tightening—the backward music's alchemy—reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as "filament" connecting sound to soul, resolved through the final image of the broken needle revealing "where feeling breathes." Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., students placing hands on drums) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's deafness filters perception through vibration and pattern. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "whisper, then a song, then a resurrection"). Dialogue is minimal but functional in signing; elision (e.g., phonograph instructions) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple roles (e.g., "the filament of hush, once acknowledged, became a thread"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("architecture of feeling") is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the backward music scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes deafness, backward music, and emotional numbness into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., phonograph needle's fracture). Risk-taking in conceptual frame heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image feels freshly resonant.</comment>
