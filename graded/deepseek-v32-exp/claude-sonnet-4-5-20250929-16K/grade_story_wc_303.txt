<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iris's characterization is deeply integrated with her abilities and moral conflict; her final choice to propagate the violin's design is earned through prior causality and embodied emotion, such as the "mulberry ache" signaling cost. Micro-choices under pressure, like sketching the blueprint, reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority remains concrete and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (propagating the blueprint) and felt cost (exile or worse), under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot escalates through Iris's visions and agency. Cost is legible in the final paragraph with consequences for her choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the velvet observatory and ice violin constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "cool glass," "bruised twilight") are filtered through Iris's POV and integrated into action. The violin and coffee stains function as micro-settings that shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (preservation vs. propagation) are signaled early and escalate through Iris's coffee stain visions and Director Kemble's pressure, driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The cost is unmistakable in the climax, with Iris forgoing safety for principle, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the violin and coffee stains, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on scattering to survive. Subtext operates in imagery and implication without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through Iris's choice, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating under pressure. Dialogue with Kemble is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., coffee stain readings) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no major loops or scaffolds. Slight overwriting in phrases like "mulberry ache" is voice-motivated and consistent. Figurative language remains clear in peak beats, and propulsion advances the story seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements (provenance researcher, ice violin, plant telepathy) into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
