<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply layered with contradictory impulses—her dedication to craft versus neglect of family—embodied in micro-choices like climbing the beam and admitting fault. Lisel's feisty nature constrains actions, and the final reconciliation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the ribbon-tying. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the new vow and shared tools, under a hybrid lens (causal dominance). Causality is tight: Mara's search leads to confrontation and resolution. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the orchard setting pays off at closure. Persistent constraint of broken vows shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard constrains choices (Mara's dizzying climb, the beam perch) and charges the final image with ripening fruit and light. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (smell of pears and incense). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting pressures the reunion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: Mara's persistence and admission force a trade-off, narrowing options to reconciliation. Cost is legible in Lisel's fractured eye and Mara's confession. Dominant stake (generational wisdom) tightens through dialogue and the ribbon vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—deciduous vows, flawed quartz eyes—without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the image of wisdom falling like leaves, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the ribbon-tying and unfinished eye.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing fractures, tools). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Lisel's accusations. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("promises fell away like apple blossoms") is purposeful and consistent. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of deciduous vows with craft and generational conflict, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The orchard cathedral setting heightens stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in structure (single scene with dense reflection) pays off at closure.</comment>
