<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's motivation is clear and intensifies through her discoveries, with embodied interiority like "boundary-lessly trapped" and micro-choices under pressure. Her final endurance is earned by the causality of her realizations, with visible cost in accepting the infinite task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where the tapestry realization reweights her purpose with cost legible in "some traps were also sanctuaries." Orientation is clear early, and structure escalates coherently to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the bronze grotto and lamp burner shape tactics. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with "shingled hush" layering atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through her agency in orienting the lamp, leading to the tapestry discovery with cost in her trapped yet purposeful state. One meaningful tightening forecloses options and reweights the task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected burdens emerges through images like the fractal patterns and tapestry, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "whalebone reverie." Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "shingled hush" is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of burdens as weights, transformed through specific details like the lamp burner method. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
