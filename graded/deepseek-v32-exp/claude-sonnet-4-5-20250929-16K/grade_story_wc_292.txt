<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her idealistic pursuit of justice for her ancestor, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., presenting the nail) revealing her values. Dr. Yoon's hope and caution add depth, though his shift from flat refusal to collaboration feels slightly rapid, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—the plan to publish coded stanzas reconfigures their exile and honors legacy, under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of government opposition shapes tactics, but the transition to collaboration could be more tightly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The weather station's isolation and the copper nail constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details (e.g., "rain hammered the reinforced windows") integrated into action. The nail's role in revealing formulae is indispensable, elevating specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from decoding stanzas to proposing publication, with cost legible in the risk of exile. The dominant stake of honoring legacy tightens meaningfully, though Dr. Yoon's quick agreement slightly reduces friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and reversal emerges through concrete events like the nail's revelation and the decision to publish poetry, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in dialogue (e.g., "Reversible exile is a myth") enriches without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "spongey dread"), and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, though minor exposition in Dr. Yoon's lines slightly flattens voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "rusted sentinel") is purposeful. No artifacts obscure closure, and sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate disaster and poetic resistance feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like coded stanzas. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the exile concept is familiar.</comment>
