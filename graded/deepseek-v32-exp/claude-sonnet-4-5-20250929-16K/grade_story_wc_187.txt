<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like measuring shadows. Her preemptive nostalgia and realization about memory transforming identity are earned, though the dialogue with Davin is brief but functional. The final stance crystallizes with cost in her altered perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as Charged Poise—Maris's reflection on remembering reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the storm's intensification drives coherence. Persistent fog instability shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—storm illumination enables shadow measurement, and crystal pillars charge the final image. Sensory details (rain, whispers) are purposeful and filtered through Maris's professional bias, enhancing atmosphere without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory preservation escalates through storm intensity and Maris's urgency, driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her desperate documentation and preemptive nostalgia, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as transformation emerges organically from particulars like shadow inscriptions and conjecture, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maris's realization, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective voice controls rhythm under pressure. Dialogue with Davin carries subtext, and elision (e.g., memory contradictions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("fog rippled like muscle") is consistent and clear, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak beats like the storm climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory archiving and fantastical setting with originality, transforming tropes through specific details like shadow measurement. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
