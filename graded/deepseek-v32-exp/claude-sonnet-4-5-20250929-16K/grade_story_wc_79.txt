<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal connection (Kade's damp whistle), with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to play the whistles is earned by prior causality, foreclosing ignorance with visible cost. However, minor lack of deeper internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change as turtles stop and watchers respond, with cost legible in the unknown consequences. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot structure is tight with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (e.g., descent between turtles) and charging the final image with the turtles' stillness. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "smell of brine and ancient reptile musk," enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to uncovering conspiracy, driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the expedition's fate and the city's halted movement, but the escalation lacks one tighter turn to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge, control, and authority emerge organically through events and images, with subtext in the council's denial. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal question without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mira's expertise; prose rhythm and diction reflect her urgency. No head-hopping or elision issues, though dialogue is absent and voice consistency is slightly less distinctive under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story effectively, e.g., in the climax where shells crack and reveal messages, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of city on turtles and spiral cartography feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes, and risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is fully integrated with character and closure.</comment>
