<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tracing stars and embodied emotion. His final realization—finding strength in vulnerability—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his continued vigil. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal his hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in Kael's acceptance of his role, captured in the final observation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of isolation shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the tracking station and yellow lantern glass constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Kael's POV, e.g., "copper dome weathered green" and lantern patterns aligning with meteor paths. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict about meaning in vulnerability) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase in the meteor shower and Kael's empathy. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, with cost legible in his foreclosed paths and the realization that "cracks let the light through." No coincidence; resolution is earned by his alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from events and images, such as the flawed lantern glass creating beauty, without direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., tracing stars as empathy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's observation, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, contemplative, and reflective of Kael's cosmic perspective. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "dancing with the sky itself," and purposeful compression supports the Accumulative lens. No head-hopping; diction and syntax are consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "cathedral of shadow and light," and sentences advance story or atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow; no register drift or artifice obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of the cosmic janitor trope through specific character and setting details. Emotional truth is authentic, and risk-taking in the lyrical, contemplative style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The concept of flourishing stillness feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality in the integration of vulnerability and wonder.</comment>
