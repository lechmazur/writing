<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion (scarred hands, screaming equations) and micro-choices under pressure (diverting power, focusing geode). Her final stance—bleak exhilaration—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing safety with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, with closure as Charged Poise (smiling at impending awakening) that reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality from past trauma drives present actions seamlessly to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (floating observatory, dust storms) constrains choices (failing life support, power surges) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the geode resonating and circuits humming, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through Amal's agency (calculations, geode adjustment) toward the unfiltered awakening. Cost is legible in her disregard for survival, narrowing options with palpable tension and exhilaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of lost potential and reality fracture emerges through particulars (geode, wedding echoes) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the coalescing "nothing and everything," reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—blend of scientific precision and poetic grief ("mathematical ghost," "captured stars"). Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("futures pooled like oil on water") is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats like the awakening climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of perturbation theory and emotional trauma feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending science and mysticism heightening stakes. Specific details (geode, observatory) transform tropes through grounded execution.</comment>
