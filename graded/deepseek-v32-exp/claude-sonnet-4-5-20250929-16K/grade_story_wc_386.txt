<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final decision to expose the truth is earned by prior dream analysis, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. No significant flaws in characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the ghost departs and Maya promises action, under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality tightens through dream fragments. The persistent constraint of the dreams shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the glacier shrine and snow globe constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates through Maya's agency in analyzing dreams, leading to a decisive choice with legible cost. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection and sacrifice emerges through events and images like the snow globe and aurora, with subtext in implication. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Prose reflects Maya's mindset, and elision (e.g., dream fragments) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with varied rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghost communication and wreck-diving with originality, transforming tropes through specific details. Emotional truth in sacrifice feels inevitable, and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
