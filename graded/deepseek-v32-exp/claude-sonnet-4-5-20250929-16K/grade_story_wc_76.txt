<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his rebellion against time; his interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in moments like trembling fingers. The final choice to activate the yoyo is earned by his prior work and mindset, foreclosing his old life with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in his bleak exhilaration add depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, events link tightly from discovery to climax; closure is a decisive change with cost as Silas feels his life unmade. Orientation is clear early with lighthouse and low tide. The hunger stone's reprise at the end charges the closure image, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "slick rocks" and "salt wind" filtering through Silas's POV. The lighthouse and yoyo constrain choices and charge the final image; atmosphere supports theme without cliché. Spatial choreography is coherent, and micro-setting elements like the workshop tools shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Silas's agency under the causal lens, from discovery to assembly and activation. The dominant stake of reversing fate tightens with each beat, and the cost is legible in the ending as his life is unmade. No coincidence; pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the yoyo representing retrievable time, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the snapped wrist, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to fate's design. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the bleak exhilaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as in the reverse-engineering process. Syntax and rhythm reflect Silas's mindset, and diction remains within his lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "time made tangible" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; peak beats maintain clarity without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing clocks and yoyo for time manipulation; turns feel earned through character choice. Emotional truth avoids templates, and risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes; details are particular and irreplaceable.</comment>
