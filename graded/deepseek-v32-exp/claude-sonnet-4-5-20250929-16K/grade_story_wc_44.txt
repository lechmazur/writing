<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied internal conflict (e.g., "the quietly deliberate scholar in Mira warred with the terrified shadow-being"). Her final choice is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices like tracing runes reveal her values. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (her decision to merge or remain independent), under a causal lens that holds. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages (e.g., key discovery leads to chamber revelation). Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the final image of her waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., observatory dome opening at noon pressures the decision). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("brass dome turning slowly," "midnight pressed against the glass"), filtered through Mira's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from curiosity to existential crisis. The dominant stake (wholeness vs. independence) tightens with visible cost (her trembling hands, fear of incompleteness). No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of identity and reality emerges from events and images (shadows, loops), with subtext in the sealed awakenings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's poised decision, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (scholarly, precise diction). Voice modulates with pressure (e.g., "hands trembled" under stress). No head-hopping; prose reflects Mira's mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful ("stars that had learned to whisper"). Sentences advance story without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reality-bending and identity in a non-obvious way, with specific details (spoons bending, shadow problem). Emotional truth grounds the concept, and risk-taking in the Charged Poise ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
