<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion shown through her trembling hand and hesitation. Her motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling her to speak plainly after eavesdropping. Viktor's confession is rooted in consistent traits, and his flawed choices compound the conflict.

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with because/therefore linkages from found stubs to eavesdropping to confrontation.

Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, enhancing urgency without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth versus silence escalates through Mira's agency: finding stubs, eavesdropping, and confronting Viktor.

Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and transparency emerges organically from events like the cryptic doodles and Viktor's confession, without direct statement.

The final image of scattered evidence offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
