<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's claustrophobia and mission create a compelling internal conflict, embodied in her physical struggle and micro-choices under pressure. Her final resolve to keep returning is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her endured fear. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Charged Poise as Maya emerges determined, reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost. Causal drive holds strong from sister's disappearance to data discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices through tidal time pressure and corrosive environment, charging the final image of the submerged facility. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's urgency. The facility itself acts as a crucible that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency as she descends deeper, discovering data that narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is legible in her claustrophobia and the rising water threat. Dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens meaningfully under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory and witnessing emerge organically from events and images, like the codex and tidal cycles. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Maya's resolve, without moralizing. Subtext in electromagnetic whispers enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical yet urgent. No head-hopping; voice modulates with pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., sister's details) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Maya's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, accelerating with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Closure image is clear and charged, with precise word choice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of claustrophobia, undersea cables, and electromagnetic consciousness feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the codex's conductive gold. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
