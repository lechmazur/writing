<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her caregiving past, with embodied emotion (e.g., "throat tight," "eyes burned") and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—realizing her courage was always in the vigil—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the years spent. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Maya's realization and the punch handed to her reconfigure meaning. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through stations and stamps, with orientation clear by ~120 words. The persistent constraint of her vigil shapes the final image of her walking with stars as a map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "sea-smoothed stones" and "fog" filtering through Maya's POV. The ticket punch as a micro-setting object constrains choice and charges the final image, evolving from tool to symbol. Atmosphere mirrors internal states, supporting theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming courage) escalates under the accumulative lens through each star stamp, deepening Maya's understanding. Protagonist agency is present in her choice to follow and accept the process, leading to a cost-legible climax. However, some passivity in receiving stamps slightly limits driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the stars and vigil, with subtext in symbols (e.g., "leash broke"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"carrying her seven stars like a map"—reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice (e.g., "rhythm of waves on sand"). Perceptual signature reflects Maya's grief-biased noticing, and dialogue (when present) carries subtext and character distinction. Purposeful compression and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "stars like a map") is consistent and purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks. No artifacts harm closure; read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms the symbolic journey trope through specific details like the ticket punch and caregiving context. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, offering a fresh angle.</comment>
