<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is deeply nuanced, with embodied contradictions (euthanasia intent vs. newfound patience) acting in scene. Her final choice to stay is earned by prior causality, such as the family rescue and parasol symbolism, with visible cost in her hesitation to cancel the appointment. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Vera's decision to stay, under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the euthanasia appointment shapes tactics until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina environment constrains choices (e.g., the supply boat mission) and charges the final image with its "song of dissolution and persistence." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Vera's POV, with the parasol acting as a micro-setting that evolves meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Vera's agency, such as her decision to join the supply boat and her internal shift, with cost legible in her changed relationship to time and death. The dominant stake (internal conflict between ending and enduring) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the parasol's fracture and the grandmother's song, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on letting go versus holding on. Subtext operates in gestures and images without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Vera's transformation. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the nature of her "change") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity in peak beats like the final decision. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism with climate disaster relief is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is fully committed to.</comment>
