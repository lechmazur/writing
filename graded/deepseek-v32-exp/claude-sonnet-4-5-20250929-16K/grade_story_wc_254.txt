<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyren's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her poetic nature and desire for understanding. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, and her final choice to write is earned by prior causality. However, no strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the humming shift and realization that boundaries are constructs. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, driven by sensory details and Lyren's actions. The quartz colonnade acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt atrium and frozen lake constraining choices and charging the final image of fractured silver. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting Lyren's POV bias towards beauty and mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyren's agency in paraphrasing, which deepens under the accumulative lens and reweights stakes with cost legible in the physical and emotional responses. The dominant stake of understanding beauty is signaled early and tightens through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final realization that beauty needs no permission. Subtext operates in implication, such as the humming and light, without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, consistent rhythm, and purposeful compression. Lyren's way of noticing is character-specific, and elision (e.g., the ban's details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "like distant bells, like ice singing," and propulsion accelerates with scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes forbidden art and personal revelation with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it is not groundbreakingly innovative.</comment>
