<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from observation to action. Her interiority is concrete through sensory filtering and micro-choices like chanting. The final fireworks display is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the fortress's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear linkage from mosaic discovery to fireworks climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where hope "cracks" the hopelessness, with cost felt in the commander's straightened posture and wet eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—moonflowers drooping, mosaic courtyard, high tower—and constrains choices by revealing the architect's note and enabling the fireworks launch. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hopelessness vs. hope escalates through Mara's agency: perceiving sickness, decoding mosaic, and launching fireworks. Cost is unmistakable in the stirred fortress and commander's recognition, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of manufacturing hope emerges organically from mosaic message and fireworks poetry, without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of light seeping through cracked hopelessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's chanting and ambient awareness. Voice is poetic yet precise, and dialogue with the commander is natural and goal-driven, advancing the stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and dense, with no loops or artifacts. Sentences propel momentum, e.g., "The kerosene knot spiraled upward... wrote messages in light." Figurative language is coherent and enhances closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fireworks artistry and existential hope feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like kerosene rag knots and mosaic decoding, with risk-taking in the quiet, resonant ending.</comment>
