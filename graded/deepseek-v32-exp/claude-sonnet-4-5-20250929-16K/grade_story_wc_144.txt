<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through her unique sensory perception and steadfast dedication; her micro-choices under pressure, such as using thermal feedback to guide welding, reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak. The final earned stasis—her calm readiness—is motivated by prior causality, with cost felt in her focused labor. No contradictory impulses are needed for this accumulative lens, as her consistent expertise balances competence with genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis under the accumulative/textural lens, with the final image of Mara preparing for more broken things reconfiguring meaning through the cost of her artistry. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of her blindness shapes tactics throughout. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the cost is legible in the "magnetic calm" she feels after repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot and micro-setting elements like the water basin constrain choice by enabling Mara's unique repair method, charging the final image with atmospheric weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the harbor sounds and light refraction woven into action. The environment evolves consistently, supporting the accumulative texture without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she progresses from diagnosing fractures to removing debris, with each step narrowing options and deepening stakes. The cost is unmistakable in her focused effort, and the dominant stake—perfecting the repair—tightens through a meaningful cadence shift aided by the ship's departure backdrop. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the transformation of damage into direction through artistry, without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mara's sensory decoding, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of "small miracles commonplace." The conceptual repricing of brokenness avoids abstraction, rooted in concrete repair actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mara's blindness, using rhythm and syntax that reflect her focused state. Elision is purposeful, such as the taught pattern of vibration reading, and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with diction aligned to her expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "fog rolled in thick... like a breathing thing," is consistent and legible, avoiding muddle in peak beats. No register drift or template cadence; propulsion is maintained through varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes blindness with artisan repair in a non-obvious way, feeling inevitable through grounded specifics like light refraction and vibration reading. Risk-taking in the accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept is fully committed to, avoiding derivative echoes. Fresh inflection arises from the reweighting of damage into direction.</comment>
