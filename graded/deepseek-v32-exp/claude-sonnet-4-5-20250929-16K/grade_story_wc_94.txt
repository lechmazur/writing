<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's "furiously tranquil" state is concretely embodied and drives her micro-choices under pressure, such as opening the envelope, with motivation rooted in consistent traits. Interiority is specific and contradictory impulses act in scene, earning the final endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost ("the cartography of scars was also a map toward healing"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the envelope's revelation tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like lightning transforming the dome's surface. Micro-setting pressures tactics through the storm's timeframe and darkroom resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as opening the envelope deepens stakes with cost legible in her "trembled" response. Dominant stake of understanding scars tightens through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like developing negatives, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "storm-kissed wonder," and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision in the envelope's reveal is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "performance of light and fury" is coherent and supports pressure, with varied sentence rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyric accumulative design heightening stakes. Specificity in details like the 1987 bus timetable avoids template plots.</comment>
