<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority shown through actions like drumming faster under the weight of thirteen lifetimes. Her quietly rebellious trait and micro-choices under pressure earn the final endurance, with cost legible in the auroral sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout, building to a charged poise closure where Maya's return to make memories sing reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the closure unit lands on-page with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden actively constrains choices through drumming-induced ripples, with sensory details like "shimmering waves" integrated into action. Setting charges the final image and shapes narrative tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes in preserving memories escalate through Maya's drumming agency, culminating in a climax where the cost of carrying multiple lives is palpable. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory and persistence emerge organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the concept of entangled lifetimes. Subtext operates through implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, such as in "cosmic hush before dawn," and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with clear propulsion and no loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in phrases like "auroral sorrow" is voice-motivated and doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory entanglement with sound-based reality feels inevitable, with specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
