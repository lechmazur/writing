<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's cool-headedness and maternal drive are consistently embodied under pressure, with micro-choices like voicing silence revealing her values. Her final action is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict (fear vs. composure) is shown in scene. The resolution forecloses a path with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (daughter speaking) and felt cost, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Sleepwalking constellations act as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from motivation to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (phosphorescent trails, dissonant chords) filtered through Mira's POV. The rail spike as a micro-setting object evolves in use, affecting tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curing daughter's silence) escalates under causal lens via Mira's agency, such as voicing silence and using the rail spike. Cost is legible in her struggle and the emotional payoff. One meaningful tightening narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief emerges through particulars like the feral lullaby and the laugh's transliteration, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and loss, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perception is character-specific, and purposeful compression (e.g., "feral lullaby") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sleepwalking constellations and emotional echoes with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in mythic tone and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
