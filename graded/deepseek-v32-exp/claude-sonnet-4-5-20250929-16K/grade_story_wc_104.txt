<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her trembling hands and deliberate grace. Her final choice to confront the soldiers is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her imprisonment is felt. However, minor lack of deeper internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as the soldier decides to help, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in the chains falling and the seeds' preservation, and orientation is clear early. The key decoding method persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting constrains choice through the key arrangement mirroring game booths and charges the final image with the vault discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mira's urgency and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, with boots outside increasing urgency and her decoding forcing a confrontation. Cost is unmistakable in the risk to the seeds and the symbolic liberation, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through events and images like seeds and chains, not direct statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to growth and freedom. Subtext operates in gestures and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled rhythm under pressure, and purposeful elision in decoding taught early. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "chains singing soft percussion" is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor poetic elevation in peak beats slightly limits score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of chained liberator, seed vault, and carnival setting, transforming tropes with specific details. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
