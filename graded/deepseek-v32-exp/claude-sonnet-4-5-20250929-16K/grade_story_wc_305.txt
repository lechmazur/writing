<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene when she faces her daughter's killer; her final choice to guide him is earned by prior causality and forgone paths, with visible cost in her realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mei's purpose married to peace; the hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds without contradiction, and the cycle of rebirth acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The umbral grotto constrains choice through the Pool of Reflection and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei's POV, with no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the hybrid lens, culminating in her showing the hairpin; cost is legible in her realization and the soul's transformation, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses easy comfort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the hairpin and climbing trees, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to forgiveness and contentment; no moralizing, with subtext in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mei's mindset under pressure, and any elision (e.g., time shifts) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of afterlife caretaker and personal forgiveness, transformed through specific details; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
