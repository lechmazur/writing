<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's reckless idealism is concretely embodied through micro-choices like the trembling lantern and crumbling certainty, with contradictory impulses acting in scene during Kael's confrontation. The final decision to try reversing the trade is earned by prior causality—the burned card and Senna revelation—with visible cost in the "scars in the fabric" line. Internal conflict avoids diagnostic speak, though minor reliance on told backstory ("fiercely gentle") slightly limits immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from Mira's past actions to Kael's demand, with closure as a Charged Poise—"ready to unmake what never should have been made"—reconfiguring options with felt cost in the "scars" and "impossible." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the symbolic web shapes the final tactics. No plot amnesia or convenience; the burned card's payoff is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choice and charges the final image, with roots embracing bones and symbols enabling the trade reversal. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "phosphorescent fruit" and "amber shadows," avoiding cliché. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves from nourishment to scars, mirroring thematic shifts without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kael's desire to reverse his destiny—escalates through protagonist agency when Senna's identity is revealed, forcing Mira's costly choice. Pressure tightens under the causal lens via Kael's confrontation and the burned cards, with cost legible in "holes in the soul couldn't be patched." No coincidence; the trade-off forecloses live options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concept of bartered destinies, with subtext in gestures like the clasped hands and pulsed fruit. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's decision to "learn to be gentle with the impossible," reweighting prior idealism without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in the web of meanings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's poetic, urgent voice filters through "gnarled apple trees" and "borrowed light." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Kael's controlled anguish. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., past trades) pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures accelerating toward closure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language like "roots threading through ribcages" is consistent and vivid. Minor overwriting in "reckless idealism" repetition is offset by concision in peak beats, and the final image propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of destiny-bartering in a catacomb orchard synthesizes fresh, non-obvious angles on familiar tropes, with emotional specificity in Kael's "hole where she should be." Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in the lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: the story couldn't work with swapped elements due to irreplaceable setting and moral calculus.</comment>
