<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation of isolated monuments for connected markers is earned through spectral lessons, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Thomas's ghost provides secondary pressure, though his non-corporeal nature slightly reduces tangibility. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her stillness warring with her need to understand, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: Elena's realization reweights her approach to carving, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality holds through patterned lessons. The ribbon roll acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and cost is legible in "creating not monuments to endings but markers of connection." No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, such as "orange light filtered through glass and vine," filtered through Elena's POV. The greenhouse and ribbon roll function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally. The environment directly pressures Elena's reflections and decisions, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens through density increases in Thomas's lessons and Elena's retracing. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, culminating in her decision to carve differently with cost legible in the transformation. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration. Escalation is meaningful and cost is unmistakable, though slightly less sharp than top-tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the ribbon roll revealing "invisible threads binding separate sorrows," without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elena's perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Thomas's speeches. Prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherence heightens emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Syntax accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes spectral mentorship and collective grief through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The premise offers a fresh angle, transformed by lived detail and emotional truth. Risk-taking with magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and bold choices cohere with closure.</comment>
