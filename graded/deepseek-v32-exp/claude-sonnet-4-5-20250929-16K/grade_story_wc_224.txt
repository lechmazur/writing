<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Isla's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and contradictory impulses shown in scene. Her final choice to seed a new book is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the quieting of her inner thunder. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Isla redefines home, costing her grief. Orientation is clear early; the lost language stone and feather discovery tighten options. Cost is legible in "the hidden thunder... finally began to quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the labyrinthine bookstore and language stone constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "books grew like mineral deposits." Spatial choreography is coherent, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) escalates under Accumulative lens through Isla's agency, driven by the feather discovery and memory flood. Cost is unmistakable in the quieting of grief and the decision to seed a new book. One meaningful tightening forecloses past avoidance and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of home as carried within emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in tactile language and seeding metaphor. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "belonging is what you carry," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm varies purposefully under pressure, e.g., "The memories came flooding back." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Voice is coherent and character-specific, with diction matching Isla's introspection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "seeds... were meant to travel." Sentence-level rhythm supports accumulative build; minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (tactile language, mercury-glass seer, bookstore mountain) feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
