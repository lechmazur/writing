<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to "make friends with uncertainty" is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like crouching and moving on all fours revealing degradation under stress. The final change—standing upright—is earned by prior causality and acceptance, with visible cost in creaking bones and shifted homesickness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she dons the pendant and understands the garden's true nature, with cost legible as dimensional homesickness becomes "something she could carry." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pendant's introduction pays off decisively at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "frozen roses" and "mist" filtering through POV. The garden constrains choices (e.g., waiting for the pendant) and charges the final image of infinite shelves, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict with uncertainty escalates through protagonist agency—waiting and then seizing the pendant—under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable when she touches the pendant and stands, foreclosing her feral state and reweighting options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically through images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the transformed library, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like interiorizing exteriors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., unclear time) is taught early and pays off at closure, enhancing foggy lucidity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "petals suspended in ice like thoughts") is consistent and supports pressure, with clear propulsion and no obscurity at closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes library guardian and dimensional homesickness with freshness and specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in structure (e.g., time ambiguity) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
