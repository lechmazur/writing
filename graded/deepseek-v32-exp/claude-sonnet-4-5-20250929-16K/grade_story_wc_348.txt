<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion (e.g., "grief, which had been a solid thing blocking her throat"). Internal conflict is shown through guilt and realization, and her final choice to return to the lab is earned by accumulative observations. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation of stasis is credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as Maya reinterprets loss into connection, with cost legible in her emotional shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns (streams, foam, chrysalis). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the environment constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (water's "overlapping rhythms," cold foam) filtered through Maya's POV. The braided ravine and chrysalis constrain choices and charge the final image, serving as micro-settings that pressure her insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming grief to continue work) escalates under the accumulative lens through Maya's agency in observing patterns. Cost is unmistakable in her emotional loosening and decision, foreclosing the path of abandonment with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through particulars (chrysalis, foam patterns) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of "the same molecules flowing in new arrangements," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded brain"). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., reflective blocks) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "foam dissolving") is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, science, and nature feels inevitable, with specific details (polymer memory, chrysalis) transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in blending themes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
