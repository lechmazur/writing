<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her inheritance and solitude, with embodied emotion like her chest aching. Her change from isolation to purpose is earned through the ghost's guidance, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. However, internal contradiction is minimal, and the final endurance feels slightly straightforward, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the endless night and lifetime debt—under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight with the ghost's appearances driving Elara's awakening. Minor deduction for lens ambiguity in mid-beats, but closure lands solidly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse and endless night are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices and charging the final image with the bead's placement. Sensory details are POV-filtered and selective, but the environment's pressure on tactics is slightly underdeveloped in middle beats, capping the score due to Q2 not reaching 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, from ghostly guidance to accepting the debt, with cost legible in the endless night. However, the tightening feels gradual without a sharp turn, and the dominance of internal conflict slightly reduces external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of awakening and debt emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the ghost's dialogue and Elara's realization. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, but occasional explicit phrasing like "resonant awakenings" lightly undermines resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice and rhythmic control; dialogue with the ghost carries subtext and advances plot. Minor register consistency in peak beats prevents a higher score, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language is purposeful, but slight over-reliance on lyrical description in climax beats causes minor momentum drag, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, ghostly guidance, and eternal night feels fresh and inevitable, with specific details elevating familiar tropes. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with originality.</comment>
