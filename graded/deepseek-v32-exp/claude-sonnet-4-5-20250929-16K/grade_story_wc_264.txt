<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guard's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices driving the narrative. Interiority is concrete, though internal conflict is minimal but sufficient for length. Final choice to cultivate sparks is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the clock's tick and blooming dune.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as conceptual repricing: clock ticks and sparks gather, reweighting possibility with cost. Orientation is clear early; wave function collapse crystallizes a branch of reality, foreclosing other paths. Structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with phosphorescent dunes and archive equations filtering through POV. Environment constrains choice and charges the final image as the dune blooms, altering tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating growth escalates under accumulative lens through guard's agency in singing and clock use. Cost is legible in the clock's tick and gathering sparks, narrowing options. Pressure coheres with one meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope and regeneration emerges through particulars like the lullaby and clock, with subtext in wave functions. Ending offers a non-literal answer with blooms and sparks, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and fragmented, mirroring the guard's state. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports tone; no muddle in peak beats. Sentences propel momentum with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes quantum mechanics and post-apocalyptic elements with fresh, non-obvious angle. Tropes are transformed through specific details like superposition and wave functions. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
