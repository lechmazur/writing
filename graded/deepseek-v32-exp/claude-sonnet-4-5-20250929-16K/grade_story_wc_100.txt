<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Meridian's characterization is deeply embodied, with consistent motives and earned transformation; her weariness and inadvertent stubbornness drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Meridian becomes eternal keeper, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the library's spatial logic pays off at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the underwater library's impossible spaces constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like kelp and phosphorescent light are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Meridian's agency under the accumulative lens, from realization to action; cost is legible in her eternal commitment, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, e.g., "peace was not a destination but an architecture."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, and purposeful elision in spatial descriptions is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold issues, though minor overwriting in peak beats doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is freshly synthesized, transforming undertaker and lighthouse tropes through specific world logic; risk-taking in conceptual repricing heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
