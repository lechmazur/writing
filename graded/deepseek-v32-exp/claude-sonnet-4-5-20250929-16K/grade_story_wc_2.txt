<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ellis's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied uncertainty. Her final choice to leave the shrine is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing resolution. The trait "uncertainly certain" drives micro-choices, like improvising with the crowbar, under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Ellis accepts mystery, with cost legible in her smiling at the next clock. Orientation is clear early, and the compass rose constrains tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the conservatory and subterranean waterfall pressuring choices. The fountain base and cavern niches constrain actions, charging the final image. Sensory details like "ochre, copper, rust" leaves reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from pattern recognition to discovery, driven by Ellis's agency under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable when she leaves the shrine untouched, affirming uncertainty. One meaningful tightening occurs as she improvises with the crowbar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through particulars like the compass rose and journal, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of recursive mysteries, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct tinkerer's perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "uncertainly certain," and elision is taught early. Rhythmic control is evident in peaks like the cavern discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "frozen hands pointing like compass needles," is purposeful and coherent. Sentence rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes clocks and temporal anomaly with fresh specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, like the compass rose calibration. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
