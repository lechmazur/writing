<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to transform pain into beauty is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like shifting from solitude to collaboration. Mira's "shyly unstoppable" trait is shown through actions, not just stated. The final choice to plant together is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the poet's internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the poet feels "something close to rest," reconfiguring her stance on solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional depth. Orientation is clear early, and the shell's setting is integral to the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell constrains choices by providing soil for planting and shaping the poet's sanctuary, charging the final image. Sensory details like "pearlescent interior catching starlight" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet's POV without cluttering momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase as Mira's arrival and the cherry bulb planting deepen the stake in creating beauty. Protagonist agency drives the shift from solitary writing to shared action, with cost legible in the poet's altered perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges through particulars like the postcards and planting, not direct statement. The "blossom armistice" concept is integrated into actions, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the poet, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction and rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., Mira's "I brought something" advances plot. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; phrases like "shyly unstoppable" are purposeful. Closure is unobscured by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic decay with hope through specific details like the shell and cherry blossoms, feeling inevitable.
