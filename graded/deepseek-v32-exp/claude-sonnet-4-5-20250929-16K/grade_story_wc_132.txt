<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits, with interiority showing concrete struggle between control and surrender. His hands shaking as he cuts wires embodies emotional cost, and the final choice to release control is earned through prior causality. The transformation feels inevitable due to established flaws and observations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Marcus embraces wild growth, with felt cost in his identity shift. The Accumulative lens holds, building through pattern and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the storm season tightens causality without coincidence resolving the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and linden tree constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like water droplets and weathered wood filtering through Marcus's POV. Setting pressures his decisions, such as removing wires, and evolves consistently with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Marcus's agency, from storm-induced reflection to actively releasing control.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth through surrender emerges organically from events and images, like the linden leaf's imperfection, without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Marcus's circuitous speech and selective attention.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts.
