<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits (insomnia, methodical hope) with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to sleep and continue the project is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in exhaustion, and contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs. determination) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as she finishes the painting and resolves to act, with cost legible in her tiredness and the vision's impact. Orientation is clear early, and the brush's role tightens the narrative coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the greenhouse and smog constraining choices (e.g., filtered light alters her work) and charging the final image. Sensory details like "saffron quiet" and "amber uncertainty" are POV-filtered and enhance atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness persists) escalates through Mira's agency with the brush triggering a vision that deepens the stakes; cost is unmistakable in her exhaustion and the painting's completion. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens forecloses doubt and reinforces her mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (brush, painting, vision) without direct statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the completed canvas and planned actions, reweighting prior material with complexity and avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical control ("saffron quiet"); voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., brush origin) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is integrated purposefully (e.g., "liquid moonbeams"), and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the vision sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insomnia, lost languages, and magical realism feels inevitable in hindsight; specific details (Tangut script, smog-choked city) transform familiar tropes, and risk-taking in the vision heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
