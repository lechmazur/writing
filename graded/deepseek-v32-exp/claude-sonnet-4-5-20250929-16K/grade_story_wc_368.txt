<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dye master's watchfulness is embodied through concrete actions like tracking sun trails, and her internal conflict about the donor heart's legacy is dramatized with micro-choices. Her final acceptance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the charged poise of the ending. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where she accepts her role, legible cost in "feeling the heart beat steadily... carrying forward something precious." Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of the heart's legacy shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the floating tea house and morpho wing constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cups thin as whispers" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The wing's reprise at the end reweights meaning, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding her magnetism escalates through the proprietor's revelation, forcing a stance crystallization. Agency in her decision to continue is driven under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the foreclosed path of refusal. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of observation as love emerges through particulars like the morpho wing and sun trails, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., "the responsibility of making visible what others couldn't see alone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "tracking sun trails across the wooden floor." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "steam rose like valley mist" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative escalation. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of inheriting a listener's role through heart transplant is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details like the morpho wing and sun trails are indispensable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
