<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celestine's motivation to defy conformity is clear and rooted in her established traits; her internal conflict and embodied emotions are concrete, and her final transformation is earned through prior causality with visible cost. The chaste courtesan concept is integral, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost—Celestine emerges carrying the prism sanctuary's light, reconfiguring her autonomy. The causal lens holds tightly, with untangling threads and harvesting echoes driving the plot. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. The setting evolves from snow-covered stones to fractured light, mirroring internal states and shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Celestine's agency under the causal lens, as she untangles threads and resists expectations to access the sanctuary. The cost is legible in her altered body and stance, foreclosing her old role. Dominant stake (autonomy vs. performance) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events—truth versus performance, autonomy through harvested echoes—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Celestine carrying light to unlock others, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control heightens pressure. Elision (e.g., "space between sigh and smile") is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms the courtesan trope through specific concepts like harvesting echoes and bodily poetic grace; risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices.</comment>
