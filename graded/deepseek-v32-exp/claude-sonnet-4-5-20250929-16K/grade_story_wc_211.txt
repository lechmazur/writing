<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miriam's characterization is deeply rooted in her role as oath scribe, with clear motives and embodied emotions. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the tree and speaking the prophecy, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final offering of the wax shaving is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the foghorn silence as inciting incident and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure lands with felt cost in the transition, shaped by the orchard's constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image with sensory specificity. Details like the "gnarled apple trees" and "harbor's edge" memory are woven into action, reflecting Miriam's POV and deepening thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through Miriam's agency, from decoding the prophecy to understanding the silence. A meaningful tightening occurs when the tree pulses, narrowing options and leading to the offering with legible cost in the transition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the wax shaving and orchard, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to accident and prophecy, reweighting prior material through the final image of "hands smelling of ancient bark."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Miriam's expertise. Purposeful compression in the flashback is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "fruit-ghosts," is precise and enhances clarity, while syntax varies naturally to support momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of accidental prophecy, rooftop orchard, and emotional archiving feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures meaning with specificity.</comment>
