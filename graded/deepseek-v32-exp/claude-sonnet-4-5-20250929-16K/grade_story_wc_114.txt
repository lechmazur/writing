<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with contradictions like trembling hands versus steady resolve under pressure. Her motivation intensifies from guilt to actionable change, earned through the fever's delirium and the smudged illustration. The final choice to recalibrate sensors is a credible renunciation of certainty, foreclosing her old path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Mira's recalibration decision, under a causal lens where her realization drives the turn. Orientation is anchored early; the structure tightens from past reflection to present action without gaps. The persistent constraint of Eva's death shapes tactics and the final image, charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the mountain air and weather station pressuring choices like the sensor recalibration. The botanical illustration functions as a micro-setting that constrains Mira's touch and charges the final image. Details are filtered through her professional bias, integrating environment with internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Mira's internal conflict between certainty and margins, escalating through her fever confession to the recalibration choice. Agency drives the tightening under the causal lens, with cost legible in her acknowledgment that certainty killed Eva. The dominant stake is tested and transformed, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the illustration and avalanche data, exploring uncertainty without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the smudge and Eva's margins method, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The final image reweights prior material through conceptual repricing of imperfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, blending meteorological precision with grief-stricken reflection. Voice modulates under pressure, as in the aurora description, without head-hopping. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, supporting subtext and character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers like the aurora metaphor. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity persists through peak beats. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting momentum without artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of fault-tolerant forecasting with personal grief, offering a fresh angle on certainty. Specific details like the snowpack sensors and botanical illustration feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, committed fully to the premise.</comment>
