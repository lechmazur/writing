<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to conquer the labyrinth of self is clear and intensifies through her timeline explorations; internal conflict is embodied in her corroding hope and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she accepts the labyrinth as part of herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout, with closure as Conceptual Repricing in Maya's realization that "the labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited"; cost is legible in her falling and walking home, shaped by the viaduct's periodic constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (viaduct, tablet) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "rainwater dripping upward" are selective and purposeful, reflecting Maya's urgency and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-understanding escalates under accumulative lens through Maya's agency in retracing timelines; cost is unmistakable in her darkening hope and the final acceptance foreclosing her search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Maya's journey, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the runes' message and her acceptance; subtext in the shifting meaning of brightness and darkness avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, introspective voice; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the final paragraph, and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "bright and darkening" is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise of procedural timelines synthesizes with character-driven exploration; risk-taking in accumulative structure and concept feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
