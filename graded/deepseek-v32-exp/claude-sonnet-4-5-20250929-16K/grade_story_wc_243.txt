<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses of grief and exultation acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to transform her covenant is earned by the locket's arrival and her proximate causes realization, with visible cost in her renewed purpose. The trait "gently thorough" subtly constrains her archival methods, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's regenerated covenant. The Accumulative drive lens holds, building through sensory density to her realization. The locket's arrival serves as a proximate cause that shifts context decisively, with cost legible in her writing and the roses' intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the blooming jetty and twilight constraining choice (as the site of ashes scattering) and charging the final image through luminous blooms and fading light. Sensory details like salt-sweet air and wood grain are filtered through Mira's POV, integrating environment with internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mira's agency, from mechanical preservation to euphoric acceptance, with cost legible in her written words darkening into permanence. The dominant stake (preservation vs. grief) tightens through the locket's recontextualization, forcing a trade-off between penance and purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like walnut ink and the locket, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on memory's weight without moralizing. Subtext operates in images (oxidizing ink, blooming roses) and Mira's realization that small moments are how we recognize we've been alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward preservation and sensory detail. Voice modulates poetically under pressure ("haunted euphoria"), and elision (e.g., the locket's sender) is purposeful, paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("cathedral of the overlooked") is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh elements (walnut-ink archivist, regenerated covenant) through specific, grounded choices in character and theme. The locket's return transforms grief tropes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
