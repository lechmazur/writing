<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her luminous doubt and empirically whimsical faith create credible internal conflict, and the final planting choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the seed planting shifts the dream-space, cost is legible in the uncertainty and time pressure; causal lens holds tightly with no breaks, and the monsoon constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the ancient ridge and blooming irises pressuring choices; sensory details like dew and impossible colors integrate with action, and the ridge directly constrains the climax by anchoring the seed planting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around cultural memory erosion escalate through Mira's dream discovery and agency-driven planting; cost is felt in the long wait and doubt, and the causal lens ensures pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges organically from events and images like the gray mist; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed's planting, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical phrases like "empirically whimsical"; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor ornate moments slightly temper peak pressure control.</comment>
