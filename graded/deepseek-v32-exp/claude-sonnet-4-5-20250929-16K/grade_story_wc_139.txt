<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply rooted in her backstory and internal conflict, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (honesty vs. necessity). Her final choice to help Pavel is earned by prior causality, reflected in her father's influence and the ink pot's symbolism, with visible cost in her reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira helps retrieve the microSD card, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible in her final actions and reflection, and the ink pot as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The funeral home setting and ink pot object constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "formaldehyde smell" and "indigo stain" filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as her decision to wait actively tightens stakes and leads to the retrieval, with cost legible in her moral calculus and the foreclosed path of pure honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the ink pot and "mathematics of a fair trade," with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "Just tell her stories" that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, exemplified by "deathly vitality," and dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with purposeful figurative language (e.g., "liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry"). No loops or artifice obscure clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements (funeral home, asylum, microSD retrieval) with emotional specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in theme and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
