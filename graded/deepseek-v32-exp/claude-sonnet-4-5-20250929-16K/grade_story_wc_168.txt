<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is deeply rooted in past trauma and embodied through scars and reflections. His final choice to continue the bargain is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his healed hand and the act of leaving the box. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Marcus's scars and the celestial imagery. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through reflections to a decisive understanding. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and porcelain box function as micro-settings that charge the final image, constraining choice through their symbolic weight. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Marcus's POV, with the box and scars reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency in reflecting on his father's journals, leading to a deepening that reweights the stake of understanding. Cost is legible in his scars and the relinquishment of the box. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bargained innocence emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like tracing words and leaving the box, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marcus's expertise and grief. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is purposeful, such as in the reflective passages, without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "topography of trauma," is purposeful and clear, enhancing momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of legacy and sacrifice through specific details like the porcelain box and celestial alignment. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
