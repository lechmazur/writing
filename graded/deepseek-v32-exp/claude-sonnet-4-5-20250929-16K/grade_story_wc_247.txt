<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses between mourning and discovery acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to disrupt music norms is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her transformed stance. The relationship with Celeste serves as a crucible, forcing micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Marina embraces movement to compose silence, charged with felt cost in her joyful sorrow. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern recognition in the harbor's rhythms. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor functions as micro-setting, constraining choices by supplying rhythmic patterns that Marina translates into physical phrases. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the camera and water charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, from observing waves to decisively moving her body. The dominant stake of translating silence into music tightens through one meaningful deepening, with cost legible in her foreclosed identity as a pianist. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the camera and harbor rhythms, offering a non-literal answer to silence as music. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the image of hands refusing to be still, with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marina's professional bias. Dialogue through signing is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression in lyrical passages is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in descriptive passages does not harm closure clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes disability and art with a non-obvious angle, transforming tropes through specific choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to its premise.</comment>
