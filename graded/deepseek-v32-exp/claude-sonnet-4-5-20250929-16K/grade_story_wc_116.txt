<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to witness change without judgment is clear and consistent; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "grips reality loosely"); final choice to incorporate the obsidian refuge earns a meaningful change with visible cost, though internal conflict is subtle rather than contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the keeper's altered memory and the weight of witnessing; orientation is clear within 120 words, and the artifact's use drives a coherent pattern toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (e.g., "books that sprouted mushrooms," roots burrowing through ceiling); it constrains choices by shaping the keeper's actions and charges the final image of cyclical decay and rebirth, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—using the obsidian refuge deepens stakes and triggers a vision; cost is legible in the foreclosed path of linear preservation and the reconfigured understanding of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and cyclical change emerges through particulars like decaying books and the origami swan; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., noticing decay and silence); no head-hopping; elision in time shifts is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly ornate in peaks, without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a chronicler in a decaying library; specific, irreplaceable elements like the origami method; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
