<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's characterization is deeply rooted in her role as a chronicler, with interior contradictions shown in her initial resistance to Lin's departure and eventual acceptance. Her motivation to "discover the texture of time" intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to embrace transition. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her acknowledgment that time moves like tides.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mei's acceptance of Lin's transition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the tidal pool and cicada motifs tightening meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres around a single scene with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with the tidal pools directly mirroring the theme of transition. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei's professional bias. The environment evolves consistently with the tide's return, shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as Mei's realization about transitions deepens the stake of accepting change. Cost is legible in her foreclosed option to "hold you here," with the pause transforming into presence. One meaningful tightening reweights the dominant stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the hermit crab and jade cicada, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to transition without moralizing. Subtext operates in silences and gestures, such as Lin producing the cicada. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV from Mei is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature in her observational voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Lin's revelation. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, as in "time moves like tides." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the conversation's tension, without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal pools, cicada symbolism, and human transition feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in a quiet, reflective story heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals, and the core premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
