<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kenji's emotional numbness and gradual cracking are embodied through specific interiority and micro-choices, such as feeling "something crack in his chest." His final choice to withdraw opposition is earned by prior causality with visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ test. Minor telling in emotional summary prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change in court, driven by causal linkages from the dojo realization, and cost is legible in Kenji's "voice shake" and tears. The inferred causal lens holds without ambiguity, and the brain jar as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting landscape pressure choices by contrasting sanctuary with instability, charging the final image. Sensory details like "cables that hummed" are selective and purposeful, constraining Kenji's meditation and realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kenji's agency under the causal lens, from numbness to courtroom withdrawal, with cost unmistakable in his "fear and hope mixing." The dominant stake of emotional connection tightens meaningfully, though the clone's role is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of complementary identity emerges through particulars like the brain jar and clone dialogue, offering a non-literal answer via the paradox of "feeling alive." Subtext operates in gesture and image without moralizing, resonating beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with Kenji's perceptual signature filtering setting through his emotional distance. Dialogue with Yoon carries subtext and advances plot, though minor convergence in emotional peaks occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "sliced through his pretense" is purposeful and clear, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The clone custody battle premise is transformed through specific choices in ego death and setting, creating a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking with floating dojo and rewriting history heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
