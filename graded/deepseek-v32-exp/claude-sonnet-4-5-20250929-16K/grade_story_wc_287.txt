<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and legacy, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like descending the fire escape. The final choice to lead the children is earned by the rose's petal drop and grandmother's memory, but internal contradiction is subtle, lacking deep flaw complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the lighthouse lighting symbolizes becoming "locksmiths of a different kind," with cost in "protected vulnerability." Accumulative lens holds through imagery, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the fire escape to the harbor, with sensory details like "water rippling silver-black." The lighthouse and boats constrain choices, charging the final image, and micro-setting elements like flashlights are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reflection to collective action under accumulative lens, driven by Mira's agency in rowing and lighting the lighthouse. Cost is legible in potential consequences, but escalation is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the rose and light, offering a non-literal answer to opening locked things. Subtext in rowing as persistence avoids moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, e.g., "wistfully pragmatic acceptance." Rhythmic control in phrases like "dipping and rising" supports pressure, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "trails of moonlight," and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of grief and mentorship through specific details like the lockmaster's tooth. Risk-taking in quiet, symbolic ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
