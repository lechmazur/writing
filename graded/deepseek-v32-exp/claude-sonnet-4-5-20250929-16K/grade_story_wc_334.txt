<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's "chronically curious" nature is consistently embodied, driving her return and methods; internal conflict between fear and curiosity is shown through concrete actions like wading into the flooded orchard. Her final memory recovery is earned by decades of folklore study, with visible cost in the flood of memories and realization of loss. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices under pressure reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words (Mara in sunken greenhouse at autumn equinox). Causal lens holds tightly: her actions (studying constellations, touching mushroom) directly lead to memory recovery. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—"The memories returned like a flood tide"—and the fairy rings persist as a constraint shaping tactics. No plot amnesia or convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks pressure choices (e.g., wading through water, navigating broken glass) and charge the final image with "crisp nostalgia." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "bioluminescence creating small halos"). Environment constrains action and mirrors internal states, such as the "accidental cathedral" echoing Mara's reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens: her detection of constellations and touch of the mushroom force a trade-off, foreclosing her ignorance. Cost is legible in the memory flood and the weight of decades lost. One meaningful tightening (alignment of fairy ring with North Star) narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and curiosity emerges organically through images like broken constellations and fairy rings, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., touching the mushroom as a "key") and the final reconfiguration of Mara's life work. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "vast archive of forgotten things," reweighting prior material without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a folklorist's perceptual signature (e.g., noting "fungal networks" and "broken constellations"). Voice is controlled and poetic, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., the guardian's identity) is taught and paid off at closure. No register drift or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "The glass panes... caught moonlight like scattered pearls"). Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore, memory, and cosmic elements feels fresh and inevitable; tropes like fairy rings are transformed into keys for memory encoding. Specific details (sunken orchard, broken constellations) and emotional truth in Mara's journey avoid template plots. Risk-taking in blend heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
