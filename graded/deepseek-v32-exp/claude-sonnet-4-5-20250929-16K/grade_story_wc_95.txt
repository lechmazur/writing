<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theodora's characterization is deeply integrated with her mechanical arm and philosophical stance, showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Her final choice to reveal the sundial code is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk of deception. Micro-choices, like using the arm to halt Venn's blade, reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Venn agrees to consider the proposal, reconfiguring options with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly from duel to revelation, with the sundial code as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or teleporting props occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook create a vivid atmosphere that amplifies the duel's sounds, while the half-painted sundial constrains choice by serving as the coded communication method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Theodora's POV. The setting charges the final image by holding the story's secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Theodora's agency under the causal lens, moving from physical duel to philosophical debate. The stakes of intellectual freedom tighten meaningfully through the revelation of the sundial code, forcing Venn's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the risk of the hidden overture and potential council rejection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between order and inquiry, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the unfinished sundial. Subtext operates in the coded messages and diplomatic dialogue. No moralizing or thematic echo; wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Theodora's philosophical voice reflecting her perception and biases. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Venn. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Sentences like "sunlight through the glass atrium painted everything in amber possibility" serve multiple jobs. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, and coded communication feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in blending genre elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
