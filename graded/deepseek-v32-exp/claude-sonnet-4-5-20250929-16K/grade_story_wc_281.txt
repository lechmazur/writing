<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's skepticism and affection are concretely embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as checking Iris's fever despite knowing it won't help. Her internal conflict between frustration and care drives credible endurance, culminating in a earned stance of transforming loss into understanding. The final choice to continue light painting is motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in the unresolved cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens holds strong, with causal linkages (static shock enables discovery) and accumulative pattern-building (light painting maps) converging at closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of Maya painting with light reweights prior material with felt cost—hope remains delicate yet enduring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, supplying key resources like the LED array and muscovite. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent, with bodies and tools interacting tactilely to advance the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating hidden pathways escalates under the hybrid lens through Maya's agency—from static shock to devising the mapping method—narrowing options and deepening knowledge. Cost is legible in the unresolved cure for Iris, yet the reconfiguration into a diagnostic tool alters tactics and charges the ending with willowglass hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into understanding emerges organically through particulars like the fractally precise patterns and somatic markers, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (Iris tracing invisible patterns) and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of making the invisible visible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Maya's) is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression, such as the crystalline instant of the shock, is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms that accelerate key beats like the static shock. No artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle; concrete imagery ("fractals of sensation blooming like time-lapse flowers") advances character and plot without padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy pill recall with somatic mapping in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in hybrid structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept is fully committed to, transforming tropes through specific details like the muscovite's piezoelectric properties.</comment>
