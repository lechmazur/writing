<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Karim's internal shift from skepticism to collaboration is earned through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her nod allowing the sound layering. The bell ringer's "powerfully gentle" trait is consistently shown in actions that reshape Karim's assumptions, with no diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Karim's changed perspective and the all-night collaboration. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building sound layers to reconfigure meaning, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The miner's lens and sound-capture equipment constrain choices and charge the final image of "golden shadows," with sensory details like fractured light and humming monitors woven into action. Setting pressures tactics through the laboratory's resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, as Karim's decision to rebuild after the sound layering forecloses her isolation with visible cost in the all-night work. Stakes tighten from data restoration to testimony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like corrupted sounds revalued as "geography of loss," with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer: connection as "continuously created." Subtext operates in gestures and silences, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Karim's observations, and dialogue carries subtext (e.g., "You're assuming the corruption was a loss"). Prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, though minor elevation fits the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "powerfully gentle, like water reshaping stone" coheres and advances the story, and closure is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corrupted sounds and emotional pilgrimage feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual resolution. Specific details like the prism-song bell ringer transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
