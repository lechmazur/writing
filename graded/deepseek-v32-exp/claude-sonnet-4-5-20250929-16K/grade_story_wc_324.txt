<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in curiosity and protectiveness, driving her to trace the pulse and act urgently. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as accessing records and calling authorities, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The closure shows earned reflection on incidental heroism, though internal contradiction could be deeper for a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from tracing the pulse to saving Elena. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Mara's reflection, and the hearing aid as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending lands with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with the mist-clad atrium and twilight, selectively detailed to enhance tone and urgency. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional focus, grounding the supernatural in tangible objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting Elena escalates under causal lens through Mara's agency, from tracing to realizing the warning. Cost is legible in the frantic pulse and urgent actions, narrowing options meaningfully. The climax forces a trade-off with visible price, though secondary stakes are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of incidental heroism and grief emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the hearing aid's silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's reflection, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical yet controlled rhythm, and purposeful compression. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift, and dialogue (though minimal) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, advancing story with clear propulsion and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is selective and coherent, enhancing peak beats without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and sentence-level craft supports momentum seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of supernatural and emotional elements, transformed through specific details like the hearing aid mechanics. Risk-taking in the concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity and authentic vision avoid derivative templates.</comment>
