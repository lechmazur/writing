<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kaia's motivation is clear and rooted in her search for truth, with embodied interiority like "words mapped themselves in her chest as hot stones." Her final choice to learn weaving is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in her questioning of abandonment. The cost of carrying the weight is felt on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Kaia chooses to learn, reconfiguring options under a causal lens. The green glass shard persists as a constraint shaping tactics, and cost is legible in "the weight then, dense and specific." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality holds without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the repair bay as a crux point that pressures choices and the shard charging the final image. Sensory details like "coolness spread through her skull" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaia's agency under the causal lens, as she redirects her path and follows sensory currents to find her mother. The stakes tighten with the pulling of worlds, and cost is unmistakable in the weight of truth she carries at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the shard and the mother's phrase, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kaia's choice to learn, reweighting prior material like abandonment and protection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with a perceptual signature, e.g., "translating touch and taste... into coordinates," and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and single, with dialogue natural and goal-driven in the mother-daughter exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "a negative sound that mapped itself... in shades of rust and violet," and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universes, transforming tropes through specific character choices. Risk-taking in the mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
