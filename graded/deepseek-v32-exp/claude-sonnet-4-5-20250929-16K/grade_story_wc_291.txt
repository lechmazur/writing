<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is deeply integrated with her prosopagnosia and methodical nature, driving key choices like the descent and portrait-drawing with embodied emotion (e.g., hands shaking). Her motivation to awaken empathy is consistently rooted and intensifies under pressure, earning the final renunciation through causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her clinical analysis versus emotional response to the ribbon, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing via Vera's drawing, reweighting the killer's loneliness with undeniable cost under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality tightens through the ribbon discovery leading to the mask-maker insight. The persistent constraint of face blindness shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the "hollow ache" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered, constraining choices like Vera's descent and charging the final image through mist and shadow. The ribbon fragment functions as micro-setting, evolving from evidence to thematic connection. Details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vera's agency under the Causal lens, from evidence examination to realization about the killer's motivation, narrowing options and leading to the drawing decision. Cost is unmistakable in her shaking hands and the description of loneliness, foreclosing paths with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the ribbon and Vera's method, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to empathy and isolation through the final image. Subtext operates in gesture and posture, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "architecture of gesture"). Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression in peaks. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., killer's face) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with no muddle in peaks. Sentences propel momentum, and closure image is sharp and cost-legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through the synthesis of face blindness and cold cases, transforming tropes with specific lived detail. Risk-taking in the protagonist and closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The non-obvious angle on empathy feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold commitment to premise.</comment>
