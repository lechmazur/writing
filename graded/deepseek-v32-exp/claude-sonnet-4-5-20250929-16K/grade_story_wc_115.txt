<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is robust with clear motivation rooted in skepticism and recklessness; her interiority is concrete, such as "drowsy alertness," and her final decision to contact authorities is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like exhaustion merging with adrenaline, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara resolves to act, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout; the cost is legible in the "weight of a swallowed truth" and the valve wheel as a "rosary of evidence." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the structure tightens meaningfully with the radio confession. Persistent constraint of guilt shapes the final image, charging the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with the tunnel's condensation and rust guiding Mara's exploration; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "darkness thick as wool." The valve wheel as a micro-setting object recurs with reweighted meaning, altering tactics and deepening atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from discovering the valve wheel to the radio confession, forcing a stance crystallization with cost on the page. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens through a meaningful turn that forecloses options, leading to her decision. Pressure coheres and grows, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring psychological haunting versus supernatural, with subtext in gestures like the "rosary of evidence" reconfiguring prior material. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of silence holding secrets, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the guilt conjuring ghosts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct perceptual signature in "drowsy alertness" and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent, and elision (e.g., the confession's aftermath) is taught and paid off. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "thick as wool" are coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes, and sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of ghost story and psychological guilt, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth and authenticity of vision.</comment>
