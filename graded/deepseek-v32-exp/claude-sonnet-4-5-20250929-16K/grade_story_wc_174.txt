<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (serenity stung by accusations) acting in scene. His final choice to call his partner is earned by the epiphany, with visible cost in the strained relationship. Micro-choices under pressure, like preparing the show, reveal his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus redefines ethical storytelling, with cost felt in his partnership and approach. Causal lens holds through linked events: argument, performance, drunk's interruption, epiphany. Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in "uncertainty could be a gift" and the resolve to call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (decommissioned radar dome) constrains choice by shaping the performance's atmosphere and audience reactions. Sensory details like "vast as space" and "half-darkness" are selective and purposeful. The campfire stick as micro-setting charges the final image and recurs across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling validity) escalates through Marcus's agency: performance and reflection lead to epiphany. Drunk's interruption complicates without resolving, tightening pressure. Cost is legible in relationship strain and renewed understanding, though interruption is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (ethical storytelling as creating uncertainty) emerges through particulars: puppet show, drunk's reaction, Marcus's realization. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the stick's use and the "meteor hush" silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marcus, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical and consistent, e.g., "half-lit epiphanies." Elision (argument recall) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; interiority coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere cohesively. Figurative language like "meteor hush" is purposeful and clear. Read-aloud quality supports propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes (artist ethics, puppet shows in seedy bars) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (introspection and performance) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in setting and character avoids generic templates.</comment>
