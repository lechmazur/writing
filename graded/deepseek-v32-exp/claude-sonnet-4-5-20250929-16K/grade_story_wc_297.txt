<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past trauma, with embodied emotions like "anxious elation." Her micro-choices, such as holding the topiary clipping and collaborating with others, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation to guide others is earned through prior causality, though internal contradictions could be more dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara and the group realize their purpose is to guide, not stop, the future, under a causal lens. The cost is legible in their shared scars and the maze's creation. Orientation is clear early, and the plot progresses via because/therefore linkages from Mara's arrival to the collective action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and maze topiary clipping constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details like "impossible luminescence." Setting is woven into action, reflecting Mara's POV and shaping the group's tactics. Specificity avoids generic post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to collective purpose under the causal lens, driven by Mara's agency in gathering the group and building the maze. Cost is visible in the scars' glow and the foreclosed option of stopping the future. One meaningful tightening occurs as their visions converge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the maze and scars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating change. Subtext operates in gestures like the touch linking scars, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, such as "shadows stretching like fingers." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through subtext. Elision in visions is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "crystallized possibility" coheres without muddle. Sentence-level craft supports momentum, though minor purple tones exist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and psychic elements with fresh specificity, transforming tropes through the root-bound visionaries' scars. Risk-taking in the mosaic-like gathering heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
