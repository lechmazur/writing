<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aina's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and the borrowed heartbeat, driving her actions with consistent interiority. Her calm exterior contrasts with desperate longing, embodied in micro-choices like encoding lullabies. The final understanding of the heartbeat's purpose is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion and renewed hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Aina reinterprets the borrowed heartbeat's meaning, felt in her exhaustion and the vision's dissolution. The accumulative lens holds, building through sensory details and ritual to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible when she sinks onto the wet stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism parapet and echoing terrace are integral, constraining choices by shaping light and sound for the mirrors. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Aina's POV. The setting charges the final image, with the parapet's light enabling the vision of possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Aina's agency in singing coded lullabies, tightening the moment before bells ring. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the vision's brevity. The dominant stake of seeking possibilities versus grief deepens with each encoded question.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the heartbeat and mirrors, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about possibility and love. Subtext operates in the lullabies and visions, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Aina's perceptual bias. Rhythm and syntax modulate with emotional intensity, such as in the climactic vision. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught through the ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and vivid, e.g., "ribbons of color that danced." Sentence propulsion aligns with scene urgency, especially in the vision's reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of a borrowed heartbeat and mirage painting is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details of grief and magic. Risk-taking in magical realism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
