<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maia's motivation to disappear is clear and evolves through embodied micro-choices under pressure, such as dropping her own stone. Keiran's backwards aging is a consistent trait that drives his teaching, and Maia's final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her shifted perspective. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through the ripple metaphor and philosophical dialogue. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Maia's understanding of presence/absence reweights the premise with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock platform and magnetic grotto are vivid, selective, and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., the pond for teaching) and charging the final image. Sensory details are integrated into action and reflection, avoiding clichés and supporting the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the ripple pattern and trance state, leading to Maia's agency in realization. The dominant stake (internal conflict about disappearance) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in her reconfigured stance. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of presence/absence emerges organically from the ripple metaphor and character actions, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of simultaneous arrival and departure, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Maia) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Prose is poetic yet clear, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and advances the plot through subtext and implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, and the closure image is sharp. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of backwards aging and the ripple metaphor offer a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible and coherent.</comment>
