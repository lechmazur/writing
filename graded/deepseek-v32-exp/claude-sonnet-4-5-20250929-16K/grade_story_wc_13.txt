<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as an illustrator; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., pendant cold against chest). Her final choice to uncage sounds is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the time exchanged. However, minor lack of interior contradiction under peak stress prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid drive with clear orientation; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the echo concept is reweighted, cost legible in "seconds for songs, moments for memories." The lens holds, and the pendant's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (e.g., rooftop canals, the Throat), constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details reflect POV urgency, and spatial choreography is coherent, though minor over-reliance on visual senses in early beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding echo origin) escalates through Mira's agency under the causal lens; cost is legible in borrowed time trade-offs. One meaningful tightening occurs at the uncaging, foreclosing other paths with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of completion emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the echo welcoming her home. Subtext operates through gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., time-sculpting mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the uncaging sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of echoes and time-sculpting; turns feel earned and specific to character. Risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image transforms prior material.</comment>
