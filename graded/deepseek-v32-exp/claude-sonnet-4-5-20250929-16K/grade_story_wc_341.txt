<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in grief and scientific obsession, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to prove the hypothesis drives the narrative, and the final renunciation of grief leave feels earned with visible cost. Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, such as her colleagues' concern versus her determination, without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through imagery and emotional depth to a conceptual repricing at closure. The ending reconfigures absence as presence with felt cost in Mara's satisfaction and the "homecoming" cloud formation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sky gondola setting is micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Mara's POV. The brass telescope recurs as a tool that shapes tactics and embodies memory. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving empty spaces remember escalates under accumulative lens through Mara's observations and emotional journey, leading to a deepening that changes knowledge. Agency is in her attention and decision to present findings, with cost legible in her foreclosed path of grief leave. Pressure tightens meaningfully without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and absence emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the telescope's ghost-touch and Victor's last words. Earned wisdom arises from particulars, avoiding moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical prose and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is consistent and character-specific, with elision taught and paid off in the closure. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language integrated purposefully. No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "wholeness spooled through air," but clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes meteorology with metaphysical concepts in a fresh, non-obvious way, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceptual approach heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like emotional cloud categorization transform familiar material, and closure commits fully to implications.</comment>
