<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a hands-on artist; her internal conflict is embodied through failed mural attempts, and the final choice to paint on glass is earned by the cathedral discovery with visible cost in her transformed approach. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her frustration yielding to insight, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing via the final image of translucent flowers, redefining night-blooming with felt cost; the accumulative/textural lens holds, with light and perception patterns tightening coherence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cathedral window discovery drives a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the amber pavilion and cathedral gardens filtering sensory detail through Marina's POV; the environment constrains choice (e.g., pavilion as studio, window etching discovery) and charges the final image, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Marina's deepening frustration and discovery, culminating in agency to paint on glass with cost legible in the mural's conditional visibility. One meaningful tightening forecloses her prior approach, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the postcards and hidden etchings, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing; subtext in "gentler witness" and the final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature reflecting Marina's artist mindset; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the cathedral climb) is taught and paid off in the closure image, maintaining rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "honeyed pools" is purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats ("pulse with life") slightly reduces clarity, but closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of art, nature, and inheritance, with a fresh angle on illumination; risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plots.</comment>
