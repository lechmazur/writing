<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (trembling hands, breath crystallizing) and earned transformation from shame to acceptance. The final choice to inscribe the rune is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost in the shedding of shame. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Master Yerin's approval, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reconfigures Kael's identity with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, focusing on internal transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in Kael's centered stillness amid gathering storms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating rock platform constraining choice through isolation and limited space. Sensory details (mist, coal-glow) are selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting elements (scars, quill) charge the final image by shaping Kael's rune and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving worthiness) escalates through Kael's agency under the Accumulative lens, as realization about their crystallization trait deepens options. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation of scars into wisdom, foreclosing shame with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: transformation of pain into wisdom through specific imagery (ice, scars). Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned through Kael's struggle and closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with poetic prose reflecting Kael's perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., breath holding), and any elision (e.g., grandmother's memory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is natural but minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and peak beats avoid muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and personal transformation feels inevitable, with tropes reshaped through specific details (scars, crystallization). Risk-taking in quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
