<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal complicity and commitment. Her final decision to keep planting is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her realization of complicity. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her guilt versus her persistence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's complicity and ongoing struggle against erasure. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with coherent causality from discovery to revelation. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of gardening shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like moss and vines that constrain choices and charge the final image. The tea house and gardens function as micro-settings that alter tactics and uncloak memories, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake against erasure escalates through Mira's agency in discovering the tea house and engaging with the old woman, leading to a tightening of her commitment.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and sacred in the ordinary emerges through concrete events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in dialogue and Mira's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of falling leaves, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's noticing, and rhythmic control under pressure.
