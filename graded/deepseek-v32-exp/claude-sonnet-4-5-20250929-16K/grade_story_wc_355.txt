<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcella's pacifism and cataloging of silences are concretely embodied; her final understanding of Elena's legacy is earned through causal tuning attempts, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and resonant reconfiguration as the diary opens; hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, with cost legible in "tears streaming" and frequencies escalating logically to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop setting constrains choice through tools like speakers and dials; sensory details (starlight, warm clasp) are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of transformed understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcella's agency in frequency adjustments; cost is unmistakable in emotional revelation and foreclosed path of ignorance, driven under hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through witness emerges from particulars like diary contents; ending offers non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting silence and resilience through earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in cataloging silences; voice modulates poetically under pressure, and elision (e.g., frequency mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts; figurative language ("molecular structure") serves character and closure with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frequencies and silence feels inevitable; risk-taking in conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, grounded in emotional specificity.</comment>
