<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deep with contradictory impulses in scene; Kael's impatience and Miren's combative tenderness create credible friction. The final choice—Kael accepting the shadow-glass and walking backwards—is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her nervous mimicry. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in actions like defiant tears and scuffing boots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost: Kael steps into dusk carrying resilience, and the swing's stillness marks a reconfigured stance. Causal lens holds tightly from tea leaf analysis to mirrored backward walking. Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of exile rules shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the playground swing's creaking rhythm defines the needed silence, and shadow-glass objects actively shape Kael's arc. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like dusty floorboards and steam rising, filtered through POV urgency. No generic placeholder; library alcove and swing are integral to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Kael's rush versus Miren's teachings force a tightening through tea leaf geometry and personal revelation. Cost is legible in Kael's mirrored backward walk, foreclosing her initial impatience. Stakes are clear and deepen via annotated hurts, though the conflict remains dialogue-heavy without physical turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: exile as an invitation to grow stronger, not harder, is realized through Kael's earned resilience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shadow-glass compass and stilled swing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Miren's gentle snap and Kael's defiant tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, as in Miren's "combative tenderness" and Kael's curt offers. Minor quibble with slight omniscient flavor in descriptions, but no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has zero loops or scaffold; high information density with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "the playground swing stilled as Kael stepped into the gathering dusk." No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and concision maintain momentum throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in a fresh synthesis: reversible exile, tea leaf geometry, and shadow-glass archive form a non-obvious whole that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in concepts heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific details like backward walking and combative mentorship. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
