<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives; her disguise of wisdom as foolishness is consistent and drives key choices. Interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like humming and offering cookies, and her final decision to act is earned by prior observations. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, with no stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot is causally driven by Mira's deductions, with clear linkage from observations to realization of the coup. Closure is a decisive change as she plans to inform the guard captain, with cost legible in her risk. The inferred causal lens holds throughout, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt observatory and eternal candle constraining choices (e.g., flame revealing embroidery patterns). Sensory details are POV-filtered and integrated into action, charging the final image. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (preventing coup) and escalate through Mira's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening as she pieces together clues. Cost is visible in her planned use of disguise, and resolution is earned by her alterations. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through motifs like wisdom disguised as foolishness and adjacent possibilities, with subtext in dialogues and silences. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and epiphanies are earned through specific experience. Complexity avoids tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's mindset. Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue (when present) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolding. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "threadbare cloak") does not harm clarity or closure. No loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is strong, and information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conspiracy unraveling through embroidery feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and character complexity avoid template plots, and the premise is fresh and non-obvious.</comment>
