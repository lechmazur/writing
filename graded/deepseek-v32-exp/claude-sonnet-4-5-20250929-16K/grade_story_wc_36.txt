<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict. Her final choice to document rather than restore is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in acceptance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the flute being both comfort and accusation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—Mira realizes the flute's entropy and reconfigures her goal to witness endings. The Accumulative lens holds, with silence patterns teaching the payoff. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of pooled silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the Thunder-echo range's acoustics dictate Mira's navigation with markers, and the canyon's silence becomes tangible. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the flute as a micro-setting that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens—playing the flute reveals the shimmer and the truth about entropy, narrowing options. Cost is legible in her renunciation of restoration for documentation, foreclosing a path with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of graceful collapse emerges through particulars like the fading flute and driftwood markers, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of witnessing passage, reweighting prior failure with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Mira's mindset. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, such as in the attenuated sound description. Elision of silence is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "silence accumulated weight." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of relic keeping, acoustic phenomena, and entropy, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, acceptance-based ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
