<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Richard's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. Maya's decisively kind trait is shown through proactive actions, though Linda's swift reconciliation feels slightly under-earned, slightly reducing the cost's depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—reconciliation and Richard's death—under a causal lens, with felt cost legible in the vinyl piece's transformation and the final hymn. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks, supporting the flawless goodbye arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the hospice's radiant haven and clouds filtering perception. The broken vinyl record recurs as a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image, reinforcing theme without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) escalates through Maya's agency—recordings and phone calls—narrowing options and leading to reconciliation. Cost is legible in the mended relationship and Richard's peaceful death, though the tension peaks a bit early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation and mending emerges through concrete particulars like the vinyl record and hymning method, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the hymn about ordinary grace, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited through Maya, with a distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, poetic prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., phone calls) is taught and pays off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled with varied syntax, high information density, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("cotton-sea of clouds") is purposeful, and closure beats are clear, with rhythm supporting emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of hospice therapy, broken record symbolism, and reconciliation arc, feeling inevitable. Specific details elevate familiar tropes, though the concept of "scent of hope" leans slightly ornamental.</comment>
