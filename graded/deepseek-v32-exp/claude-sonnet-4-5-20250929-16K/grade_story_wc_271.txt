<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Layla's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., placing palms on glass to count waves) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her endurance is earned through prior causality, and internal contradictions (freezing then thawing) act in scene. The final choice to tend what grows forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered routines to an Earned Stasis closure where she finds "enough" with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with the pearl of stillness image reconfiguring meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choices (e.g., glass wall for calming) and charges the final image with its "persistent" bloom. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Layla's POV. The environment pressures her survival tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Layla's agency under the accumulative lens, as the helicopter incident triggers a somatic response that she actively manages. The cost is legible in her physical struggle and recovery, narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs when she freezes and then applies her coping method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of surviving "the endless, ordinary after" emerges through particulars like the photograph and lavender cuttings, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of tending growth. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, enriching complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "the Mediterranean herbs released their scent... anchoring her"). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., trauma backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal coherence remains under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "pearl of stillness") is consistent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and character without scaffolding; closure image is clear and uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery with horticultural work feels inevitable, avoiding cliché through specific detail. Risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. The pearl of stillness concept transforms familiar material into a fresh, coherent stance.</comment>
