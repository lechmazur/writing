<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's prosopagnosia is deeply integrated with motivation and micro-choices, such as photographing the coin and deciding to paint the custodian, creating a credible arc of faith despite blindness. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with no stock phrasing. Final choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the realization that "the limits we discover matter less than the reaching" reweights the premise with cost (tree's destruction, coin's warmth). Orientation is clear early; causality is intact with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree library setting is vividly specific and constrains choices through the demolition deadline, charging the final image. Sensory details (sap, diesel engine) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation deepens through protagonist's agency in discovering the coin and reflecting on its meaning, reweighting the stake of impossible ambitions. Cost is legible in the library's loss and the persistence of attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of noble futility emerges organically from events (coin, her art) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the warm coin and her continued painting. Subtext is rich in the parallel between her blindness and the monk's engraving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical voice that reflects the protagonist's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the coin's details).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is sharp. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prosopagnosia, fractal coin, and tree library feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in thematic depth. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
