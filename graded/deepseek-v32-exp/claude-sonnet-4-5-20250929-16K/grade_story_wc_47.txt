<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like offering the pendant revealing her values under pressure. The executive's vulnerability and shift are earned through dramatized interaction, though her transformation is slightly swift. Contradictory impulses are shown in Mira's admission of past hatred, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the executive leaves with a path toward absolution, cost legible in the amber's weight and Mira's endurance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns (icicles, data maps) deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows from confession to visit without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the data center turned moss garden pressures choices (sanctuary creation) and charges the final image through organic patterns. Sensory details like "emerald silence" and dripping icicles are selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as Mira's proffer of the pendant deepens the conflict and forces a stance shift with cost (emotional weight). The dominant stake of healing vs. pain tightens through dialogue and imagery, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from particulars like the pendant and garden, with subtext in silence and gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "grafting hope," avoiding moralizing and reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm ("watchful dreamer," "honeyed hush") that modulates under pressure. POV is stable and single, with dialogue natural and goal-driven; elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor register elevation ("emerald silence") exists but does not obscure clarity. Rhythm supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of surveillance trauma and ecological renewal, with tropes transformed through specific details like the amber pendant. Risk-taking in quiet, contemplative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
