<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Matthias's motivation evolves credibly from revolutionary fervor to weary scholarship, with embodied micro-choices like covering mirrors and using the shard during storms. His internal conflict between academic dismissal and personal insight is concrete, and his enduring quest forecloses other paths with visible cost in isolation. The final stance crystallization is earned by prior causality, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Matthias places the shard against the mirror, reconfiguring his understanding of time and civilization with undeniable cost in his solitary dedication. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through layered imagery and reflection. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of temporal storms shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting pressures choices through mirrors and storms, constraining actions and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Matthias's POV, with the shard and mirrors functioning as micro-settings that alter tactics. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Matthias's agency during the temporal storm, using the shard to deepen stakes and force a revelation. The dominant stake of reimagining civilization tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in his continued solitude. Protagonist actions narrow options and change knowledge without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the shard and mirrors, exploring memory and erasure without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of overlapping species, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through implication and poetic imagery, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Matthias's worldview. Voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure, and any elision (e.g., temporal storms) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal coherence supports the Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the storm revelation. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without padding, and the closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes temporal archaeology and non-human civilization with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic form and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the core concept is fully committed.</comment>
