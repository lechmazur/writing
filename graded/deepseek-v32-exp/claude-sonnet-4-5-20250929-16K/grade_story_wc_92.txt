<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inventive nature and resistance to the Council. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like the smile in darkness, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. The final endurance of her role as sentinel while advancing the revolution is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk to prisoners.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring options as the revolution ignites, with cost felt in the imminent threat to prisoners. The causal lens holds tightly, with the blackout orchestrated by Kael and Mira's actions driving the plot. Orientation is clear early, and the sundial's role as a communication hub reinforces persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout create a vivid atmosphere that pressures choices, such as the darkness enabling Mira's movement. The sundial acts as a micro-setting that constrains tactics and charges the final image with its coded angles. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of the silent revolution escalates through Mira's agency, with the blackout tightening options and forcing confirmations. Cost is legible in the 72-hour deadline to save prisoners, and escalation under the causal lens is driven by protagonist choices, narrowing paths meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion emerges through events like the coded messages and blackout, with subtext in gestures like Mira's "winking hush." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "cradle of sparks" metaphor, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Mira's perceptual signature evident in her calm inventiveness. Voice is coherent through turns, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision, like the blackout's origin, is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and no loops or scaffold issues. Sentences advance story and character, such as the description of the sundial's angles. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is purposeful without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a lock sentinel using a sundial for coded messages is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Specific details like the bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial transform tropes through grounded choices, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
