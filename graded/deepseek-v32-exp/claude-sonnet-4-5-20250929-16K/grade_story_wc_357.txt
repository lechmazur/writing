<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in family history, driving her intrepid choices during the Turning. Interiority is concrete, shown through embodied actions like gripping controls and digging with hands, avoiding stock phrasing. The final discovery and decision to confront the council feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the foreclosed path of continued withering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under a Causal lens, from Kael's goal to the echo revelation and canister discovery. Orientation is anchored early by ~120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the proof of theft and renewed purpose—landing on-page in the final image of fruit falling like rain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the water flow guiding navigation and the Arch Maze constraining routes. The orchard planet and floating arches charge the final image, with sensory details like "shimmering columns" of water integrated into action. Micro-setting (the broken arrow tip) directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—escalates through protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from following water to decoding echoes. The tightening forecloses options with cost, as the discovery reveals theft and demands confrontation. Time pressure of the Turning adds coherent urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stolen resilience and memory emerges implicitly through events like the echo revelation and canister discovery, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "echoes remember everything," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward piloting and water navigation. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "Her hands moved with practiced precision," and any elision (like the council off-page) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "fruit fell like rain" serves closure without muddle. Sentences advance story economically, e.g., "She followed the water."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements—orchard planet with gravity inversion and acoustic echoes—into an inevitable arc. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like navigating by water flow. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels earned.</comment>
