<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to remain in the Library is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic language (e.g., "brittle awakenings"), slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael chooses to coexist, foreclosing isolation with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of awakening and tidal shifts deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of charting territory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the Tidal Library and atomically reflective floors constraining choices (e.g., tides force movement, reflections act as maps). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image. Specificity like thylacines and dodos enriches atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of isolation vs. independence escalates under the Accumulative lens through Kael's realizations and tidal pressures. Agency drives a meaningful tightening as she confronts the map, with cost legible in her decision to stay. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and coexistence emerges through concrete images (sundial, tides) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Kael's charting, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the thylacine's welcome, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, reflecting Kael's mindset. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., memory fractures) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "atomically reflective" repeated). Clarity and propulsion remain strong, especially in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reincarnation and extinct species in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specifics like the sundial and tides transforming tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable. Authentic vision avoids derivative echoes.</comment>
