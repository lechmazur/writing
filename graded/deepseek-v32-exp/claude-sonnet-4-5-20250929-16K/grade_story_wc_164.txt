<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calla's motivation is deeply rooted in childhood memory, with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (cheerful gloom) acting simultaneously. Her final choice to document paths is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "smiling through the gentle sorrow." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("gentle sorrow"), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the temporal swallow's return reinforces causality. Cost is legible in the final promise, shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crater glass constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. Setting is integral to action, such as vines preserving memory, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the revelation about paths fading. Dominant stake (why paths disappear) tightens through discoveries, foreclosing options with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Calla's realization. Subtext operates in images like sea-foam, avoiding moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in poetic prose and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., memory fading) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is absent, but internal voice coheres under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no register drift. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, e.g., "luminous patterns shift... like memories dissolving."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes elements uniquely, with risk-taking in tone and concept that heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes (e.g., paths as memory) feels inevitable in hindsight, and specificity anchors universals without derivative echoes.</comment>
