<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vess's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a lore keeper, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., peeling paint, not sitting on the throne) revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete, such as tears at the mural, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Vess chooses not to claim the throne, carrying "the weight of possibility," with cost legible in the final image. Causal lens holds tightly from entrance through waterfall to stairway ascent, and orientation is anchored early. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the kaleidoscopic waterfall and painted walls constraining choices (e.g., peeling paint reveals mural) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "cascading pixels refracting light," and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vess's agency under the causal lens, from using the ruby flake to peeling paint, narrowing options and leading to the stairway. Cost is legible in her refusal to sit, foreclosing power for hope. Dominant stake (finding the throne) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the paint layers representing memory and the throne's ambiguity, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on legacy vs. power. Subtext operates in gestures like not sitting, avoiding moralizing. Integration is strong but slightly reliant on familiar archetypes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic and precise diction ("living color that sang in forgotten frequencies"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., data fragments) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor template cadence appears in descriptive sequences. Read-aloud test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar quest tropes with fresh elements like data fragments and paint layers, creating a specific, inevitable arc. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes, but some concepts (e.g., throne) are not fully transformed beyond archetype, limiting ingenuity.</comment>
