<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garrett's motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His final choice to leave the note is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses of stoicism and sensitivity under pressure. The hierarchy of values is clear through micro-choices like writing the memory, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Garrett secures the note, reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds, weaving absence and presence. Orientation is early and clear, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains choices (wading through water) and charges the final image, transforming it into something sacred. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Garrett's POV, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Garrett's agency under the accumulative lens, as he decides to leave the note, foreclosing other paths with visible cost. The dominant stake of preserving memory tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges organically through particulars like the note and pavilion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, deepening the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Garrett's profession and grief. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though minor register drift in phrases like "hushed blaze" slightly strains coherence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of an archaeologist of abandoned dreams is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflective tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
