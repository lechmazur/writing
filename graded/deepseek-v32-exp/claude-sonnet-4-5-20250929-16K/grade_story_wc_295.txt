<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotions shown through actions like inviting Kove to sit. Her empathy and Kove's guilt are character-particular, and the final choice to collaborate is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in Kove's unlocked chest. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they realize the need for collaboration, with cost legible in Kove's weight becoming bearable. The causal drive lens holds, with the telegram and conversation leading to shared work, and persistent constraint of isolation shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly described and constrains choices, such as using the telescope to track stars, and the daylilies charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding inscriptions and personal burden escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from Mira's solo work to shared realization. Cost is legible in Kove's grief and their decision to carry burdens together, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from events and images, such as the star harmonization, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "wisdom lives not in lonely stars but in the spaces between them," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet consistent voice reflective of Mira's perspective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges with Kove, and no head-hopping or register mismatches occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and character efficiently, such as in the climax where understanding dawns with the sunrise, and read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes lucid dreaming, astronomy, and personal drama in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming the isolated scholar trope through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
