<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her shift to "translator of possibility."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost—Miren's realization that transformation is the message—under the accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ashen arbor constraining choices and charging the final image of blooming transformation; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Miren's agency via the moonstone discovery and experimentation, narrowing options under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in her transformation and the arbor's bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of emergence and transformation arises from events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final monument and Miren's insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the moonstone prodding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of skyborne arbor and transformation feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise is fully committed.</comment>
