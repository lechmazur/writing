<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion like "luminous torment" and "crushing her chest." Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure, such as transforming her practice, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira finds peace amid grief, with cost legible in the final image of her "descending while ascending." The accumulative lens holds, building through pattern and density. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "steam from celestial kettles" and the glass basilica's movement. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, as the tea garden and floating isle mirror internal states. Recurring objects (cranes, gems) shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal grief management, escalating through Mira's agency in crafting lanterns. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each crane, foreclosing options and charging the final image with cost. Resolution is earned by her transformation, with visible price in the endured torment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the cranes and "descends while ascending," without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's persistence. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, with complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision (e.g., the basilica's movement) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language like "luminous torment" is coherent and purposeful, with no major loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation fits the POV, and closure clarity is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (dream recording, floating isles) feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity avoid template plots, offering a fresh angle on grief.</comment>
