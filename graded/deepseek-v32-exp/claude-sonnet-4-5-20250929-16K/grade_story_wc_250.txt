<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with internal conflict, her guilt and fear palpable through concrete actions and micro-choices. The guardian's silent presence motivates key turns without exposition, and Mara's confession is earned by the light patterns' accumulative pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the final choice carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing achieved through Mara's confession and return, with cost legible in her fractured voice and subsequent action. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building via light patterns to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of light shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the cobalt dock and canal reflections constraining choices and charging the finale. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-settings that actively pressure Mara's realization. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's guilt) escalates under the accumulative lens through the guardian's light patterns, deepening her understanding until her agency-driven confession. Cost is unmistakable when she reveals the coordinates, altering outcomes. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from light/shadow motifs and Mara's arc, with subtext in silent empathy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truths as guiding stars—without moralizing. Complexity arises from particulars, avoiding abstraction or tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's poetic perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Rhythmic control enhances emotional beats, and purposeful elision (e.g., guardian's silence) pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the silent light-language concept, synthesizing empathy and guilt with irreplaceable specificity. Risk-taking in wordless communication heightens stakes, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes or hedging.</comment>
