<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation at the stillpoint is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of coexisting love and grief. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is shown through concrete actions like dowsing and absorbing notes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost at the stillpoint, where grief and love occupy the same coordinates. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern shifts in the melody and forest silence. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and platinum ring function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory detail filtered through Mara's POV. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, and spatial choreography is coherent. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating grief) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increases in musical notes and ring pulling. Protagonist agency drives escalation, with cost legible in the emotional resolution at the stillpoint. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images like the melody and stillpoint, offering a resonant non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, and the final image reweights prior material with emotional honesty. No thematic echo or drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no register drift or overwriting. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and the final line resolves with charged imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of grief mapping through specific details like ultrasonic forest and skin absorption, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation avoids template plots.</comment>
