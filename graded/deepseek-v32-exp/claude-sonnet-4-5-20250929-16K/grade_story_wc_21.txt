<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation intensifies credibly from archival distance to active witness through the retrocognitive experience; her final choice to decode everything is earned by Elijah's memories, with visible cost when she collapses and rearranges debris. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "memory seized her like a fist," and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Maya shifts from keeper to voice for encrypted voices, with cost legible in her "searing focus" and the final image of testimony; causal lens holds tightly from diary decoding to retrocognition to resolution. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the encryption shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as the site for retrocognition and Maya's debris arrangement; sensory details like "black sand" and "driftwood" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the causal lens, as decoding the diary triggers retrocognitive trapping and forces her stance crystallization; cost is unmistakable when she gasps back into her body and commits to testimony, foreclosing her archival distance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of witness and memory emerges through particulars like the debris messages and encrypted diary, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "WITNESS TESTIFY REMEMBER"; subtext operates in the sheriff's dialogue and Elijah's fear, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "their paper yellowed like old teeth"; dialogue in the parley scene carries subtext and goal pursuit, and elision in the retrocognition is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "memory seized her like a fist" is coherent and purposeful, and propulsion accelerates through peak beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of retrocognition and civil rights history feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the consciousness-preserving diary that heightens stakes; specific details like the musical note cipher and obsidian lagoon avoid template plots.</comment>
