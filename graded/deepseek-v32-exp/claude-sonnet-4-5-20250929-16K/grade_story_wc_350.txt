<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in empathetic decisiveness, with micro-choices like learning Tigrinya and prompting silos revealing her values under pressure. Interiority is concrete, and the final choice to address Elevator Seven directly is earned by prior causality, though her character leans slightly perfect without strong contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly, with Mira's actions triggering silo responses and the closure unit (decisive change to communal singing) landing on-page with felt cost in the initial silence and effort. Orientation is anchored early, and the clock's mechanism persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the astronomical clock tower and grain elevators constraining choices and charging the final image of shared song. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from initial singing to overcoming Elevator Seven's silence, with cost legible in the risk of failure and emotional investment. Stakes of connection vs. isolation tighten meaningfully through protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection through diversity emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the spontaneous harmony. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, avoiding moralizing or abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical yet precise, and dialogue (when present) feels natural and goal-driven. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts obscuring causality. Sentences advance story and character efficiently, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes grain elevators, refugee communication, and celestial imagery into a fresh, non-obvious angle, with turns feeling earned through character choice. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
