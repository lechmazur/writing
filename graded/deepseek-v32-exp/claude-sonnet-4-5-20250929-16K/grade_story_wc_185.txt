<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotions (e.g., feeling discord in her bones) and micro-choices (humming, using the stone) that reveal her values under pressure. The final endurance and reconfigured quiet feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion. However, interior contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced, limiting the peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot coheres through sensory buildup and the protagonist's actions, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (bloom of hush) with felt cost (exhaustion, balanced caves). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the energy beings' constraint shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the harmonic caves and ice patterns constraining choices and charging the final image (e.g., crack patterns guide the hum). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description, and the environment actively pressures the protagonist's decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring quiet) are signaled early and escalate through the mapkeeper's agency (descending, humming), under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening that narrows options. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the caves' reconfigured balance, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., ice cracks as language, bloom of hush), with subtext in implication rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the quiet had been there all along") that reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward resonance and mineral detail. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., patterned ice examination) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely (e.g., "the bloom of hush unfurled"), and clarity is maintained even in the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of harmonic caves and bloom of hush is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis, transformed through specific details (ripple-mark tattoos, echo chamber stone). Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
