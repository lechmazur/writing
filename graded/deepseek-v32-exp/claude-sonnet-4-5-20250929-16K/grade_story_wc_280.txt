<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with synesthesia integrated into her actions. Her shift from seeking applause to helping others is earned through on-page choices, such as using the tarot coin and singing. Contradictory impulses (hunger for applause vs. selfless act) are dramatized, and the final renunciation has visible cost in her eternal seeking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Celeste's smile reconfigures her purpose, with felt cost in her ghostly existence. The Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds, with her singing causing timeline changes. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with the garden's temporality enabling the outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details filtered through Celeste's synesthesia. Specificity is high, such as "apple trees heavy with silver fruit," and the setting pressures tactics by allowing time manipulation. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Celeste's agency under the Hybrid lens, as she senses despair and acts to change the young man's future. The stake (her internal conflict between applause and purpose) tightens through her singing, with cost legible in her effort and eternal seeking. One meaningful deepening occurs as possibilities crystallize.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, focusing on redemption and art transcending death, without moralizing. The final image (blossoms blooming, Celeste's smile) offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through echoes and synesthesia, though slightly sentimental in tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice reflecting Celeste's synesthesia ("colours had exploded across her vision—deep purple tasted of longing"). Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, and elision (e.g., timeline fractures) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, e.g., "echoes that rippled through the orchard." Sentences advance story and character, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise is fresh, synthesizing ghost story, synesthesia, and fractured timeline into a non-obvious whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details, like the tarot coin's shifting images. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
