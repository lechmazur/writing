<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kera's interiority is concrete and embodied, with internal conflict shown through her interactions with the ghost and regret. Micro-choices under pressure, like clicking the camera wheel, reveal her hierarchy of values. The final negotiation is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the brush of fingers and reflected blueprints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the ghost's touch and blueprints. Accumulative lens holds, with motifs building to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
