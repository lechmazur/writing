<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply rooted in her unique ability to taste memories, which drives her motivation and actions consistently. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "metallic determination mixed with bitter grief," and her micro-choices under pressure, such as pruning based on tasted memories, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to nurture hope is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her deliberate rebellion against the Council's destruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear causal chain under the Causal lens, from planting the seed to the tree's growth, with closure as a Decisive Change—the greenhouse becomes a "beginning" with cost legible in Mara's risk and effort. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the cost could be more sharply felt in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse and tripled moonlight create a vivid, atmospheric setting that constrains Mara's choices, such as clearing space among broken glass, and charges the final image of the fruit gleaming. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV, with the environment mirroring internal states of decay and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes of gentle rebellion and knowledge cultivation are signaled early and escalate through Mara's agency under the Causal lens, notably in the pruning action that narrows options. The cost is legible in her deliberate removal of harmful memories, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs, though the escalation is more gradual than intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as pruning as a metaphor for shaping history, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fruit symbolizing hope, reweighting prior material with meaningful ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature in her ability to taste memories, shaping narrative stance. Prose has a poetic texture, and elision is purposeful, though dialogue is absent; voice remains coherent under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits strong rhythm and variation, with high information density and no significant loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor purple tendencies exist (e.g., "hope reclaiming architecture"), but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity, such as memory-tasting and knowledge fruits, transformed through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in the gentle rebellion concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight and fully committed.</comment>
