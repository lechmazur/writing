<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation shifts credibly from commercial success to personal meaning, embodied in her tracing the columella curl and creating the palette of resolve. Kael's secret forces a revaluation that feels earned, with visible cost in her decision to stay and preserve his sight. Internal conflict is shown through concrete actions rather than summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira commits to staying, redefining her alchemy through devotion, with cost felt in the shift from gold to meaning. The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, driven by Kael's revelation and Mira's response. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the columella curl's recurrence charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus and columella curl are vividly described and constrain choices, such as Mira tracing the spiral and the nexus pulsing with their presence. Sensory details (e.g., "dying light," "warm and alive with drifting sparks") are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of their joined hands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reunion to preserving memory against blindness, driven by Mira's agency in creating the palette of resolve. The cost is legible in her renunciation of profit for devotion, narrowing options under the hybrid lens. Kael's secret serves as a pivotal tightening that forces her revaluation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of science and romance, exemplified by the "scientifically romantic" work and the columella curl's symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of transforming sight into light, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the whispered secret and returned curl.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her alchemist perspective. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Kael's whisper and Mira's response. The poetic voice modulates with emotional pressure, such as in the description of the pocket-suns' colors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences like "the spiral catching the dying light like a promise" doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity is maintained even in peak beats. The final paragraph's cadence reinforces the theme without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes alchemy and emotion with specificity, transforming the "returning home" trope through Kael's blindness and the palette of resolve. Originality lies in the non-obvious integration of mathematical beauty and preserved presence, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
