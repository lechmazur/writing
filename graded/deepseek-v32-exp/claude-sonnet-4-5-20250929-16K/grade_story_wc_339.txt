<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final stance—observing rather than untangling—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. The relationship with death is consistent and deepens the arc, though minor hairline slips in diagnostic language ("quietly analytic") prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the snow globe image and Marina's realization. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of death shapes tactics. No causality breaks, but the lens could be more tightly woven earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (barnacled spine, geometric avalanches) filtered through Marina's POV. The snow globe and library constrain choices and charge the final image, elevating the score. Economy and selectivity are strong, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the transmission) escalates under the accumulative lens through Marina's agency in retrieving and reading the log. Cost is unmistakable in her realization and the snow globe's symbolism. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake, though escalation is subtle due to the reflective mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically from particulars (snow globe, log entries) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marina's observation. Subtext operates in implication, and the core concept integrates seamlessly, though the philosophical weight risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("quietly analytic precision") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is coherent and sophisticated. Purposeful compression in reflection is taught and paid off, with no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("cathedral's ghost") is integrated without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and the final line recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of deep-sea exploration and philosophical grief, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific detail, and the closure image is indispensable.</comment>
