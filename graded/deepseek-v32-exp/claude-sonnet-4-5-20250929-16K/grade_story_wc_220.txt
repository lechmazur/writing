<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finder's characterization is deeply rooted in her past as a tracker, with clear motivation sparked by the phonograph cylinder. Her internal conflict between forgetting and remembering is embodied in micro-choices like tracing the grooves and journeying west. The final shift to "find the living" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her retirement foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong from the inciting incident (cylinder arrival) to closure (reconnection with Crow). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost—Finder's renunciation of her solitary retirement. The lens remains consistent, and cost is legible in the final image of them "translating the distance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—corrugated walls, cracked wasteland—and integrates sensory detail filtered through Finder's POV. Key objects like the preserved leaf and phonograph cylinder constrain choices and charge the final image, with the leaf's veins forming a map that directs the journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection escalates through Finder's agency under the causal lens, from decoding the riddle to the journey. Cost is legible in her decision to leave retirement, foreclosing that path. Escalation tightens options meaningfully, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges organically from events and images, like the riddles and preserved leaves. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "reading hope." No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—Finder's intuitive, descriptive voice. Prose rhythm varies with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., secret texts) is taught and paid off. Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, as in "twisted metal bones." Rhythm supports scene needs, and closure image is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes with unique elements like phonograph riddles and wax-preserved leaves feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (journey and reunion) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
