<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction between grief and skepticism is embodied in micro-choices like placing the prism against the frost. Her final endurance as a guardian of hidden knowledge is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the "shattered" assumptions. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in "her assumptions about reality shattered with an almost audible crack." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to a decisive change. Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of the prism and frost method shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choice and charge the final image, acting as a "battery" for emotions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV. Setting guides action and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) escalates through Mara's agency with the prism and frost method. Cost is legible in the prism darkening and assumptions shattering. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to foreclose old beliefs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth emerges through images like the prism and mist, with subtext in "truthful lies." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "The mist embraced her like an answer," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; diction matches Mara's mystic perspective. Purposeful compression in peak beats supports clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, e.g., "skeletal cathedral." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs; no register drift or muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of emotional residue in objects through frost patterns feels inevitable. Tropes transformed via specific details like the prism's evolution. Risk-taking in mystical concept heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure charges prior particulars.</comment>
