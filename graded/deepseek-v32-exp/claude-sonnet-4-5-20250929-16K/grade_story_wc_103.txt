<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her choices; her dissolution is earned through prior causality with visible cost, and interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her trembling fingers and reverent acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Miriam disperses into the garden's memory, reweighting time's nature with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when clearly established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden and hyperbolic maze constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as the root-woven spans and pools reflecting memory, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering time's texture—escalates through Miriam's agency with the halo fragment and maze, leading to a cost-legible dissolution; under the Accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, such as the fading photographs and recursive time, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through implication, like the maze as a lens for reality's structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, intellectual diction; voice modulates under pressure, such as the rhythmic prose during dissolution, and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or overwriting; figurative language, like "time felt like standing in a doorway between two mirrors," is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and time as texture with inevitability; risk-taking in conceptual depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and details are particular and transformative.</comment>
