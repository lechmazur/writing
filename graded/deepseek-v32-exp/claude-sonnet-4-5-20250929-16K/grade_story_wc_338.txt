<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's methodical curiosity is embodied in concrete actions like frame-by-frame comparison and cross-referencing, driving her choices under pressure. Her final recommendation to leave the eastern approach exposed is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting partial revelation. Interiority remains specific and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the final realization about "the permission to listen deeply to what couldn't be spoken." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern recognition and deepening silence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fresco vault and henge environment constrain choices, such as the vault's influence on Elena's perspective and the grass patterns altering her investigation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the unmappable. Micro-setting elements like the footage screens and foundational stones actively pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the Accumulative lens, from comparing footage to discovering the spiral pattern and older foundations. The cost is legible in her recommendation to expose the wound, foreclosing full certainty. Dominant stake in interpreting silence tightens through meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like map tears and henge silence, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "the map of human longing" at faith's border. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as identical head tilts across decades.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elena's professional bias (e.g., "where cartography becomes faith"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in varied syntax and selective detail. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent through emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is integrated and purposeful, as in "ghostly suggestions" of saints mirroring map absences. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with discovery, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of map restoration, silent footage, and ancient henge to explore interpretable silence. Risk-taking in the conceptual, quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific detail.</comment>
