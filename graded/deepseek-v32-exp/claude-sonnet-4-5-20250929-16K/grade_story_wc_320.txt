<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final realization is earned by prior causality, and the cost of discarding assumptions is felt, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost on-page ("beginnings and endings are the same frequency"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the lunar perigee constraint shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the radio tower and gorge constraining Mira's choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in tuning equipment differently, under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her realization. The stake (finding the true signal) tightens meaningfully, though the turn is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence and cosmic hum, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (e.g., "shard of hush") is taught and paid off, and prose reflects Mira's mindset consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor register drift ("fantasy practicality") occurs without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic listening with post-collapse realism in a fresh, inevitable way. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
