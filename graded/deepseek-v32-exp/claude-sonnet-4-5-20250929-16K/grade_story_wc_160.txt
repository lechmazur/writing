<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her pulse quickening at the hidden message. However, the lack of deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits the highest band, though her final choice is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot is causally driven with clear orientation and a decisive closure where water flows harmoniously, costing Elena three days of effort. The inferred causal lens holds throughout, and the persistent constraint of the volcano's thermal cycles shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the amphitheater and volcano constraining choices and charging the final image through thermal expansion and dust. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elena's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the restoration of the valve with visible cost. The conflict tightens meaningfully, though the escalation lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final reconfiguration of communities harmonized charges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, though dialogue is minimal. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision in the encrypted message.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language, like "the building breathed," enhances peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of encrypted compassion in an ancient system is original and ingeniously synthesized, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and detail heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
