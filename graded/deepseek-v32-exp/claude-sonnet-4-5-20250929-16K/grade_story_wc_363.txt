<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., using jigsaw pieces and amber bead). The final sacrifice is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle but present in her stoic response to memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost (presence departs, bead dims) under an accumulative/textural lens; the unraveling silence and weaving pattern hold coherence, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of time's unraveling shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (orchard isolation, bamboo thickness) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the environment mirroring internal states (e.g., "bamboo stopped whispering").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (recommencing weave, using puzzle edges and bead) under accumulative lens; cost is legible on-page (fingers bleed, presence departs). Dominant stake (saving village) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice emerges from events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through concrete particulars (love measured in thread and time). Subtext in weaving as prayer avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., "raveling silence"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is purposeful and clear in peak beats (e.g., "message lifted like mist"). Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weaving, jigsaw puzzles, and metaphysical communication feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
