<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion like "volcanic tenderness" and trembling hands. Her final choice to upload evidence is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; internal conflict is dramatized through her actions and grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as Marina commits to uploading proof, with felt cost in her weeping. Causal lens holds strong from arson to discovery, orienting early. The persistent constraint of academic erasure shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the archive constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "headlamp caught wall after wall" and "dry air" reflect POV bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment pressures discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving Tethani existence escalates through Marina's agency in documenting and piecing together clues. Cost is unmistakable in her grief and risk. Escalation is driven by causal linkages under the lens, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus erasure emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext in actions like burning libraries; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through Marina's promise kept. No moralizing; complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, analytical yet emotional. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "volcanic tenderness." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "accumulated like sediment" is purposeful. Sentences advance story efficiently; rhythm varies naturally without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of arsonist-as-truth-seeker and academic conspiracy, with specific details like pre-Columbian textiles. Tropes transformed through grounded choices; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
