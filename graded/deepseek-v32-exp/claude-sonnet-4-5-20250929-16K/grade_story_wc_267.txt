<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and rooted in her accident and quest to understand safety's cost. Her interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like pocketing the bolt and humming revealing her values under pressure. The final choice to remain and sing is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her defiance against erasure. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her silent service versus active listening, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with Marta's decision to remain and sing, reconfiguring the silence with active remembrance at a felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of imagery and discovery. The ash marks and bolt object persist as constraints shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of "frostbitten hope" and her enduring defiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the cobalt fortress and snow-draped turrets creating an oppressive atmosphere that pressures choices. The spiral staircase and ash marks constrain Marta's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV, such as the "tingling" hands and "dusty" steps, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding safety's cost escalates under the accumulative lens through Marta's agency: discovering ash marks leads to her realization and humming defiance. Cost is legible in her enduring the "unpardonable silence" and management's opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the bolt beside the mark, narrowing options and foregrounding remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence and memory emerges organically through particulars like the bolt and ash marks, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, such as the "ghost-weight" of loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Marta's singing, reweighting prior material without moralizing, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Marta's selective attention to silence and traces. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, from lyrical descriptions to compressed beats under stress. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the avalanche backstory) is taught and pays off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "prayer frozen mid-ascent" are purposeful. Line-level craft is flawless, with clarity and propulsion maintained even in peak beats, such as the discovery of ash marks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of elements—nerve regeneration, silent choir history, and frostbitten hope—feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a non-obvious moral calculus on silence.</comment>
