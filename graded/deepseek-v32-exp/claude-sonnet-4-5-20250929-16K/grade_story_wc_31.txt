<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like the dive revealing hierarchy of values. The final renunciation to lamplighting is earned by prior causality with visible cost in his gasping surfacing and new reverence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as focus vs. distraction, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Marcus witnesses the luminous vows and reconfigures his understanding, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The key tag and wreck shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of shimmering amber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with the sunken ship library forcing the dive and the sky lanterns mirroring the vows. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, such as "water cold enough to steal breath." Economy and purpose drive description, avoiding generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from disguised research to the dive and journal discovery. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional realization and vision of the vows. Dominant stake (discovering truth) tightens through meaningful deepening, foreclosing easy answers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the journals and vows, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mystery and grief. Subtext operates in images (sky lanterns as slow-burning stars) without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material through the conceptual repricing of witnessing over solving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia (e.g., foghorn blasts spark crimson). Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression in peaks. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "like a cathedral of rust." Sentences advance story without redundancy, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes synesthesia, sunken ship, and lamplighter into a non-obvious whole, transformed through specific details like the key tag mnemonic. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids derivative premises.</comment>
