<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and earned change; the skimmer's historically reverent nature compels her to help the pulse, and her final action is rooted in centuries of patience, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; the pulse's release and integration into the canyon's song reconfigures meaning, and orientation is clear early with coherent causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the bone towers and echoes constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "sound folded into itself" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the skimmer's agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering the pulse to understanding and releasing it; cost is legible in the pulse's transformation and her unwavering stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of navigation through stillness emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in echoes and pulses; the ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature reflecting the skimmer's consciousness; rhythmic control under pressure, and no head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "folded into itself like prayers" is coherent and purposeful, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and ingeniously synthesized, transforming tropes through specific details like resonance navigation; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
