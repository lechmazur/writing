<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is deeply integrated with her role as an ignorance cartographer, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as her pause before the third parchment, earning the final Charged Poise with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the suspended future, under a consistent Causal lens; the obsidian spire and dwindling resources shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., thermal vents key to Future Three) and charging the final image of warmth beneath the ice, with vivid sensory detail filtered through Maren's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency in writing the three futures, narrowing options under the Causal lens with unmistakable cost legible in each future's survival rates and trade-offs, such as innovation dying in the Fortress Path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mapping ignorance emerges organically from Maren's actions, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending's emphasis on willingness to see beyond the known, devoid of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "trembling threshold where possibility still breathed," and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "like a blackened tooth" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of ignorance cartography is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in concept heightening stakes without obscuring clarity, and specific details like the kingfisher quill enhancing originality.</comment>
