<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water." His shift from legend-seeking to truth-seeking is earned through causal discoveries, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with coherent because/therefore linkages; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus's realization reweights truth-seeking with cost legible in "truth required a different kind of seeking." Orientation is anchored early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "amber reflection and diesel shimmer" filtering through POV. The barge canal constrains choices and charges the final image, evolving from twilight to industrial dawn to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Marcus's agency, with one meaningful tightening as he discovers the maps, forcing a trade-off between myth and evidence. Cost is felt in his altered purpose and the salvaged truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bent sundial and maps, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to truth vs. illusion without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and implication, deepening through hindsight clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision is purposeful, as in the radio silence payoff. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts or loops; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "sleeping monuments." Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of legend-seeking and conspiracy, transformed through specific details like Dessen's tragedy. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
