<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a crisis actor, with internal conflict shown in her "benevolently ruthless" methods. Her final role as historian of small gestures is earned through prior causality, with cost visible in her relentless pursuit. Embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as making survivors repeat walks, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through patterns of small gestures, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the pawns are remembered, with cost in Mara's work. Orientation is clear early, and the whispering gallery's properties shape tactics. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image of gestures walking into permanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vividly described and constrains choices, serving as a micro-setting that becomes the archive. Sensory details like "nomadic penumbra" are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV. The environment charges the final image by learning the walks, integrating setting into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving small gestures against forgetting escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency in developing her method. Cost is legible in her ruthlessness and the gallery's resonances. One meaningful tightening occurs as her project deepens, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the chessboard and walking patterns, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and loss. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, without moralizing. The final image of gestures refusing to die reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled diction, and rhythmic prose that heightens pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, as in the exchange with the colleague. Elision is taught and paid off in the closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "nomadic penumbra" is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes crisis acting, a whispering gallery, and archival of small gestures into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure reconfigures meaning with originality and conceptual integrity.</comment>
