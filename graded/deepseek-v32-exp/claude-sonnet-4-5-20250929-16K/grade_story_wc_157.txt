<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Malachi's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal his values. The father's story about his daughter adds depth, and the final endurance is earned. Minor deduction for slight convenience in his charismatic portrayal, but no major flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation and closure as a Conceptual Repricing—the secret language taking root reweights the premise with cost legible in the risks. The drive lens holds, and the ending image charges prior material. Hairline slip in the transition to weeks later, but closure remains strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "smell of soil and beetle wings" and the greenhouse constraining choices by being off-grid. The gourd seeds as micro-setting charge the final image, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of mental freedom escalate through protagonist agency, with cost visible in audit risks and the daughter's story. Under causal lens, pressure tightens as the language spreads, foreclosing options. Minor deduction for off-stage garden patrols, but escalation is driven on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges through particulars like gourd seeds and gardens, with subtext in "they can't tax what grows wild." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., Iris's questions. No head-hopping; elision in time jumps is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "seeds rattled like imprisoned thoughts" is purposeful and clear. Read-aloud rhythm supports pressure, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of thought tax is familiar but transformed through specific botanical code and character choices. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the method heightening stakes. Minor deduction for derivative elements, but execution is fresh and coherent.</comment>
