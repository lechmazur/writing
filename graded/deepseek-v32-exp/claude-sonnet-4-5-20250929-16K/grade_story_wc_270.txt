<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply rooted in her past as an insurgent and her loss, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to midwife the future is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between destruction and preservation. The cost is felt in her reflection on her daughter and her own journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with clear orientation early on. Closure is a decisive change as Lira commits to gardening futures, with cost legible in her stance shift from fighting to nurturing. The embryo's unsealing reconfigures options, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with volcanic hot springs and plants constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes around evolving tradition escalate through Lira's agency in decoding the script and unsealing the embryo, under a causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in her commitment to change, narrowing options and foreclosing her prior path as an insurgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of evolution with intent emerges through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to tradition's renewal, reweighting prior material without moralizing, supported by Lira's arc and the embryo's symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in plant communication and Lira's worldview. Voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision in decoding is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum without muddle, even in peak beats like the unsealing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and implanted destiny.
