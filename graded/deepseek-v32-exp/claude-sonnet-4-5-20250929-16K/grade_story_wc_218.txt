<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in her acceptance of death, driving her to find meaning. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "brazen calm" and micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to remodel. Her actions align with motives, and the final endurance is earned, foreclosing paths with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like limited time shape tactics coherently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final diary entry and Marina's death, reweighting the premise of interconnectedness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through her observations and actions. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored within 120 words. Causality is tight, with her decisions leading to the temple's restoration without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with living stone pillars and the temple orchard pressuring choices through fractures and symbiosis. Sensory details like mineral mist and sagging floors are selective and integrated into action. The environment constrains tactics, such as using copper wire, and charges the final image of renewed vitality. Spatial choreography is coherent, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving the temple and finding meaning escalates under the Accumulative lens through Marina's agency, like mapping patterns and planting oaks. Cost is legible in her expended time and death, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening, driven by protagonist choices without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges organically from events like the symbiosis discovery and copper wire method, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures and the diary's margin notes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and diary entry, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Marina's observational voice. Prose has controlled rhythm and diction, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven in the brief caretaker exchange. No head-hopping or register mismatch; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, without loops, scaffold, or overwriting. Figurative language like "acupuncture for geology" is purposeful and clear. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes living stone pillars and symbiosis with a caretaker's limited time, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like copper wire mechanics and diary entries. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in the quiet closure heightening stakes. No derivative premise or echo without transformation.</comment>
