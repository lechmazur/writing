<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses like considering self-harm while whittling, and her final choice to remove the bouquet is earned through prior causality. The emotional void post-Mandate is conveyed through specific micro-choices, such as her flat narration and the physical act of whittling down to lightness, with visible cost in the disintegration of the flowers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Maya takes down the bouquet, foreclosing a path with felt cost in the emptiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with the whittling and narration building pressure until the final image reweights silence and grief. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the petals falling "like manufactured snow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting—farmhouse beneath turbines, dried bouquet, whittling knife—constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like the turbines' groan and brittle petals filtering through Maya's POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, and the bouquet's removal reconfigures the space, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Maya's agency in whittling and narrating, culminating in the bouquet's removal with unmistakable cost in the "lighter now, emptier" state. The dominant stake of grappling with grief tightens through each reduction of wood, and the final act forecloses the option of stagnant mourning without breaking the fragile peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like whittling and the bouquet, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief through the image of "lightness" and absence. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing; the conceptual repricing of "remade hush" lingers with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic, detached narration that reflects Maya's emotional void. POV is stable and single, with rhythmic control under pressure, such as the cadence matching turbine blades. The dramatic narration method is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "carving silence into smaller, more precise silences," is purposeful and coherent, and the final paragraph's propulsion supports the closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar dystopian elements with fresh specificity through the "remade hush" concept and whittling action, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation of grief into "lightness" is grounded in character choice.</comment>
