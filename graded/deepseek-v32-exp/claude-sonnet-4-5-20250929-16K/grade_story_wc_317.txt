<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miranda's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits like receptivity to signs, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to safeguard her business is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the closure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages from the seed's arrival to its integration into the business model. Closure lands with a decisive change—her commitment to independence—and cost is legible in the final image of the bloom and brook. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the nocturnal haven and brook filtering through POV and constraining choices, such as planting in the courtyard and weaving the environment into puzzles. The corpse flower as a micro-setting charges the final image, reweighting prior material with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around protecting the business escalate through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from seed planting to innovation against corporate threats. Cost is unmistakable in her transformation and the foreclosed path of sellouts. Pressure tightens meaningfully with each beat, driven by her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—uniqueness versus commercialization—without direct statement, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer in the closure. Subtext operates through the mentor's gift and the flower's symbolism, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical yet controlled under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and any elision (e.g., the mentor's backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue, though minimal, feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and syntax accelerates with scene needs. No register drift or scaffolding; closure image is sharp and unobscured by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of escape rooms, corpse flower, and mystery seed is fresh and inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and originality are fully integrated, supporting closure.</comment>
