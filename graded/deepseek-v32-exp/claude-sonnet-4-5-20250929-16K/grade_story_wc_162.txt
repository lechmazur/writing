<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like running fingers on the drafting table. The final choice to step through the threshold is earned by prior causality, though some emotional abstraction slightly limits embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost in "terrace dissolved into prismatic fragments," under an accumulative lens that holds throughout. The persistent constraint of the drifting terrace shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and oak planks constrict choice and charge the final image, with sensory details purposeful and integrated into action. Micro-setting elements like the drafting table evolve consistently under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency in discovering the logbook and realizing her parents' roles, under an accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her acceptance of irreversibility, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds and necessary distances emerges through particulars like the logbook and maze, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. Purposeful compression in reflection is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of corn maze, logbook, and thresholds feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes. Specific lived detail avoids derivative premises.</comment>
