<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's professional detachment and Keegan's internal conflict are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. Keegan's shift from seeking certainty to embracing doubt is earned through prior causality, though his vulnerability peaks rapidly, slightly limiting emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Keegan's certainties unravel, a Decisive Change under the Causal lens. The spiral staircase ascent and wind chime mechanics create logical linkages, and orientation is anchored early by dawn and lighthouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choice through the wind chimes' constant presence, charging the final image of glowing chimes. Sensory details like salt-thick air and brass tubes are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, using the mirror and chimes to force Keegan's confrontation with doubt. Cost is legible when he sinks onto the bench, foreclosing his path to certainty with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as an honest garment emerges through particulars like the hollow mirror and wind chime readings, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Keegan's whispered admission and the chimes' descent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in Mara's wind chime deciphering. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, as in "You paid," and prose rhythm modulates with pressure, though minor convergence in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "cloak of doubt" is coherent and voice-motivated, and sentence propulsion accelerates with the chimes' insistent notes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of conscience-for-hire concept with wind chime divination feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices, and risk-taking in metaphorical objects heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
