<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is deeply rooted in her father's actions, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion shown through her interactions with Marcus. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as guiding his scarred hands in grafting, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final smile from Marcus crystallizes her earned compassion, satisfying the 9+ quick test with contradictory impulses in scene and a cost-legible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Maya's grafting metaphor and Marcus's smile reconfigure meaning with felt cost, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The cost is legible in the final image of scars singing, and persistent constraints like the coins shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., grafting in volcanic soil) and charging the final image with transformative weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's POV, and the environment actively pressures decisions, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, as the grafting action deepens the stake of proving scars can sing, with cost unmistakable in Marcus's emotional breakthrough. The dominant stake tightens through a meaningful cadence shift, and the resolution forecloses paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like grafting and coins, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the coin necklace holding pain and love, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical, controlled prose that modulates with emotional pressure. Rhythmic control under stress is evident in lines like "the scars were singing," and any elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "scars can sing," is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level rhythm accelerates with scene needs, satisfying the 9+ quick test with zero muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of grafting, coins, and compassion feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and metaphor heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to its implications, demonstrating a non-obvious angle.</comment>
