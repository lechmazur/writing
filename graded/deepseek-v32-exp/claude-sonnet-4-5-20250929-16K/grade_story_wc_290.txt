<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is embodied and drives micro-choices under pressure, such as focusing on architecture to combat enclosing darkness, and her final reach for the key is earned by prior causality. However, her competence lacks visible flaws or blind spots that compound mistakes, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mara collapses gasping after obtaining the key, and the causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (organ vibrations reveal mutiny, compass guides action). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the spatial rebellion persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the shifting corridors and starlit void pressure Mara's actions, and sensory details (e.g., "stone thrumming with resonance") are filtered through her claustrophobic POV. The nexus acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, using the compass in response to organ vibrations to narrow options, with cost legible in her disorientation and gasped collapse. The dominant stake (finding the key) tightens through her decisive tracing of the spiral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of spatial rebellion emerges through particulars like the architect's discovery and Mara's triumph, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("walls refused their own nature") without moralizing. Subtext operates in the organ's wistful defiance and her reconfigured comfort.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature biased by claustrophobia and exploration, and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., syntax tightens during disorientation). Purposeful elision (e.g., spatial shifts) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("origami nightmares") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the key retrieval.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept of spatial mutiny offers a fresh synthesis of exploration and psychological tension, transformed through specific details (e.g., compass mapping geometries). Risk-taking in surreal elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
