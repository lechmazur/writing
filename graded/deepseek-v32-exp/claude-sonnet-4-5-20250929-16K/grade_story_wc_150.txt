<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices, such as her curiosity about the roots and bones, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses her hollowed past with visible cost in the final image. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to rebuild the sundial is credibly endured, scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost legible in the sundial's transformation, under the accumulative/textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the pattern of purposeful wandering pays off at closure. The priest's enchantment reinforces the cost without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "roots had broken through the catacomb ceiling" filtered through Mira's POV. The environment pressures tactics and evolves causally, supporting the theme without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with discoveries like the sundial deepening stakes and narrowing options. Cost is legible in her internal shift and the communal act, foreclosing her isolation. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the roots and bones interplay, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of faith and continuity without moralizing. Subtext operates in images and implication, such as the sundial's reconfiguration, inviting reflection through earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in Mira's "warmly curious" filtering of the catacombs. Purposeful compression, like the description of the sundial base, is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "roots like wooden lightning," is purposeful and clear, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora returnee, catacombs, and sundial feels organic and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in thematic depth heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reweights prior material with freshness.</comment>
