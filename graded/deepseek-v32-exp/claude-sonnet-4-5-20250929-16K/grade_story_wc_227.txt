<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's uncertainty is embodied through trembling hands and self-narration, with micro-choices under pressure driving the climax. Her final placement of her own essence feels earned by prior causality, and the resolution accepts cost without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds strong, with closure as a decisive change (statue breathes) and resonant reconfiguration (light spreads, meaning woven). Cost is legible on-page in the wave's strike and workshop holding. Orientation is early and clear, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: the acid sea and gears pressure the climax, and the workshop as micro-setting alters tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "acid spray hissed," "gears ground"). The environment charges the final image by buoying the workshop with assembled memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, with the acid wave forcing a tightening of options. Mira's matching of essences and final choice carry visible cost (her uncertainty used). Stakes are dominant and signaled early, with one meaningful deepening at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges through particulars like the charm and statue repair, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("meaning wasn't found... but woven") that reweights prior fragments. Subtext operates in gesture and image, with no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflected in Mira's narrated actions. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "She narrates softly" during panic). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "golden light erupted"). Sentences vary in structure and accelerate with scene needs, maintaining clarity through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of kintsugi with emotional repair feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in hybrid structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is fully committed to and integrated with character and closure.</comment>
