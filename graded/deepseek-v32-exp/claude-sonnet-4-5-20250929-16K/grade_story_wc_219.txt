<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's skepticism is concretely embodied and drives her choices; her internal conflict between rationality and revelation is shown in scene, and the final reconfiguration of her skepticism is earned through prior causality with visible cost in her changed perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing on the page—the realization that homecoming is about self-understanding—under the accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the reweighting of her skepticism, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the tower and sculpture garden constraining choices by guiding her path to the footprints; the recurring amber object charges the final image, enhancing the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under the accumulative lens—following footprints to the formula—with cost legible in her reconfigured understanding; stakes tighten meaningfully through discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the amber and footprints; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to homecoming without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scientific-reflective perceptual signature; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., visitors' details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language (e.g., "bronze quiet") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of sci-fi and literary themes, with the artificial pilgrimage concept feeling inevitable; risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
