<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Celene's prism-minded nature and motivation to find forgotten combinations are clear and consistent, driving her actions. However, interiority lacks depth in peak beats, with emotions summarized rather than fully embodied under stress. The final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality, but the cost feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (preserving vigilance), and the causal lens holds strong. The inversion hour and threshold effects create coherent linkages, though the orientation is slightly delayed but functional. The final image of seeds planted reconfigures stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the grotto during inversion guiding Celene's path. Sensory details like "clandestinely luminous" lines and "stone tears" are purposeful and charged in the closure. The environment actively shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving knowledge escalate through Celene's agency during the inversion, narrowing options as she navigates thresholds. Cost is legible in the risk taken, but the escalation lacks one tightening turn under the causal lens, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and hidden knowledge emerges organically through events like the doodle discovery and seed planting, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of blooming vigilance, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "prism-minded" analysis filtering details. Prose rhythm controls pressure well, but minor register drift occurs in peak beats (e.g., "latent blaze" feels slightly elevated for the POV).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid imagery, though occasional ornate phrases like "serpentine path drawn in ink" risk mild overwriting without harming clarity. No major artifacts or loops; sentence-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of gravity inversion and botanical consciousness, transforming tropes through specific stakes. The concept commits fully, with risk-taking in the premise heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
