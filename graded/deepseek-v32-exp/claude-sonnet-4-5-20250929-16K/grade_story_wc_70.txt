<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives her choices, including the climactic revelation. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like trembling hands, and her final action is earned by prior causality. Minor tidiness in emotional progression prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot has strong because/therefore linkages from the blackout to Mira's revelation. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost legible in the engineers modifying drones, and the old woman's visit incites a meaningful tightening. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lightning tower and lacquer box constrict choices—Mira climbs the tower to deliver the box's contents—and charge the final image of drones dusted with pollen. Sensory details like "amber sky" and "copper coils" are selective and purposeful through Mira's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to systemic change, driven by Mira's agency in solving the riddle and confronting the engineer. Cost is visible in the drones' modified flight paths, foreclosing the path of pure efficiency. One meaningful tightening under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the riddle and pollen, offering a non-literal answer about imperfection and wonder without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material, resonating through the drones' "new randomness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., Mira finding beauty in "geometric shadows." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with the old woman. No head-hopping; elision in the riddle solving is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "the riddle settling into her mind like sediment." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes truthfulness implants, drone pollination, and lightning towers in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the riddle and lacquer box heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure is legible.</comment>
