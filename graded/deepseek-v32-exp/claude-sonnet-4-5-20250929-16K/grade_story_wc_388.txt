<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through concrete observations and micro-choices. Her final decision to burn the documents is earned by prior causality, showcasing internal conflict and a visible cost in foreclosing truth to preserve hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under a causal lens, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where Maya's realization reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the burning of documents and the orchard's preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the wasteland orchard constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are POV-filtered, and the environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (truth vs. hope), escalation is driven by Maya's agency in uncovering the stillpoint, and cost is unmistakable in her decision to perpetuate the lie. Meaningful tightening narrows options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in actions and implications. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on the cost of truth, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity through Maya's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and character without obstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is fresh, transforming the curse trope through specific world logic and moral calculus. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet ending that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
