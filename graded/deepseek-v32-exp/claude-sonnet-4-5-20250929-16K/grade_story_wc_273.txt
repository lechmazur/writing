<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is deeply rooted in her brother's death, with embodied emotion like "anger was a still lake" and micro-choices under pressure, such as studying the ink patterns. Her final decision to hunt is earned by prior causality, foreclosing other paths with visible cost. The characterization avoids stock phrasing, and internal conflict is shown through her serene fury.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise as Kael resolves to hunt, reconfiguring options with cost felt in her "serene anger." The causal drive lens holds tightly from discovery to decision, with orientation clear early. The ending image of turning toward the desert reinforces the cost and persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with "wind-carved encampment" and "pale rock," filtering through Kael's POV to charge the final image. The alcove and ink patterns constrain choices, and sensory details are purposeful, though the environment could be more actively pressured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from tracking to understanding time's nature, driven by Kael's agency in discovering the ink's meaning. Cost is legible in her decision to pursue truths at personal risk. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time and memory emerges through concrete images like disappearing ink and the brother's death, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's pursuit, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice like "consciously wild grace" and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong, and elision (e.g., time crisis backstory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "prismatic flashes" serves clarity, and sentence-level craft supports momentum without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tracking with metaphysical time portals in a fresh, inevitable way. Specific details like ephemeral ink patterns transform tropes, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
