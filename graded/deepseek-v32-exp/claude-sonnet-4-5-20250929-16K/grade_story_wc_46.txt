<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling her ritual of transformation. Interiority is concrete through embodied actions like weighing sea glass and polished hands. The final endurance choice earns its cost through prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between memory and healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in Mara's continued polishing. Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the weathered hands and notes left by others. The grotto setting and sea glass pattern teach the design, paying off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the serpentine grotto pressures Mara's sanctuary creation, and sea glass placement shapes light sharing. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with mist and stone amplifying atmosphere. The environment actively alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens through Mara's agency in polishing and placing glass, deepening the transformation theme. Cost is visible in her physical strain and emotional weight. One meaningful tightening occurs as she achieves "pearl of stillness," foreclosing escape in favor of endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sea glass polishing, avoiding moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to pain transformation. Subtext operates in imagery (light without fire) and gestures (weathered hands). Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective prose mirrors Mara's mindset. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., unclear blue glass memory) is taught and pays off in thematic resonance. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("pearl of stillness") is consistent and purposeful, clarity intact in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with emotional intensity, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in specific synthesis of grief ritual through sea glass, transforming a familiar trope with grounded details. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise feels inevitable and fresh, with emotional authenticity.</comment>
