<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling hands) and micro-choices (broadcasting messages) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (switching off the transmitter) is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with visible cost in her isolation. However, minor passivity in early beats slightly limits agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vera understands her role as vessel, with cost legible in "gritty and strange" work. Accumulative lens holds through fragmented message patterns. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory constraining choices (isolation, pilgrim visits) and charging the final image. Sensory details (ozone, copper taste) are POV-filtered and selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: message density increases, factions form, and Vera's agency in broadcasting tightens stakes. Cost is legible in her claimed-but-misunderstood status. One meaningful deepening suffices, though external pressure relies slightly on off-stage groups.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from Vera's struggle to blend old and new, with subtext in prophetic messages. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("both the question and the answer") without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical-prophetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent (e.g., "electric darkness"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression (fragmented frequencies) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("rusted crown") is coherent and supports pressure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prophet trope through specific details (radio arrays, variant allegiances). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
