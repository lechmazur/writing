<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's hybrid nature and physical reaction to dishonesty provide concrete interiority and motivation that intensify under pressure, compelling her search for truth. Her micro-choices, like inviting Kade, reveal values with visible cost as she strengthens. Kade's arc from hollow brightness to candor is succinct but earned, supporting relationship dynamics. The final decision to return and tell others is a credible endurance foreclosing isolation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds strong from fragment discovery to Archive finding, with orientation anchored early in the greenhouse city. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as adding truths reweights hope against the toxic sky, with cost legible in "something older and more resilient began to bloom again." No causality breaks; persistent constraint of the sky shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with amber light, toxic sky, and Archive depot, filtering through Mira's POV to pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "gold-veined leaves caught the filtered amber light." The greenhouse city constrains survival, and the Archive as micro-setting alters tactics by enabling honesty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honesty vs. deception escalates through Mira's agency: finding the map, inviting Kade, and etching plates. Cost is unmistakable in emotional trade-offs and the contrast between external oppression and internal resilience. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs as small truths redefine options, though stakes remain primarily internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerging from lost conversations is woven through events and images without moralizing, culminating in the plaque's revelation as a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like Kade's quiet admission and Mira's leaves responding. No thematic echo; complexity arises from particulars like the Archive's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's poetic yet precise observation. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Kade's shift from hollow brightness to raw honesty. Voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping; elision like the fragment's partial text is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "leaves brightened, catching light like stained glass" is consistent and purposeful. Sentence propulsion varies with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats such as the Archive discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements—gilded-leaf calligrapher, Listening Archive, toxic sky—into an inevitable whole with emotional specificity. Tropes of post-apocalyptic search are transformed through grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in hybrid nature and emotional stakes heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
