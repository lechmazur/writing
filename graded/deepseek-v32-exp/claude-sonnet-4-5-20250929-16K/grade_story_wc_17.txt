<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique profession, intensifying as she discovers Eleanor's legacy. Her sensitively perceptive trait is embodied through micro-choices, like trusting environmental cues, and her final decision to preserve the archives is earned with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens with discoveries building to a conceptual repricing at closure. Mara's realization about architectural consciousness reweights the premise with cost, evident in "the burden of knowing the truth." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the ivy's sigh reinforcing the ending's resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the ivy-veiled passage and fireplace constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like the whispering ivy and acoustic anomaly are filtered through Mara's POV, integrating environment with action. The corridor's sigh at the end acts as a micro-setting that alters the story's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as each discovery deepens her understanding and commits her to the burden. The cost is legible in her realization of Eleanor's legacy, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres from the ivy's reactions to the acoustic anomaly, driving one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the diaries and film negatives, exploring memory and consciousness without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's commitment to honoring "the dreams of walls." Subtext operates in imagery, such as the building's sigh, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Mara's perceptual signature evident in her selective attention to echoes and ivy. Prose rhythm and diction reflect her professional focus, and elision (e.g., the building's "words") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language like "ivy-veiled passage" is purposeful. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats, such as the glimpse of the building's dreaming, without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of architectural consciousness is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like echo cartography and Eleanor's diaries. Risk-taking in the premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids templates, with the burden of truth lending authenticity.</comment>
