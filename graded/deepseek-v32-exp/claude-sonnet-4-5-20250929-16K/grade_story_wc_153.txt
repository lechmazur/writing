<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Isla's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion shown in micro-choices like clutching the letters. The final choice to run toward reconciliation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the memory scene where she sees her sister's trembling hands. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with Isla's realization that "the moment before deciding never truly passes" charging the final image with cost. The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the gargoyle shard acts as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and transitions between memory and present are smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "brackish water silver" filtering through Isla's POV. The setting pressures tactics, as the spirits' songs form a "luminous path" guiding her return. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciliation is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency in the memory scene, where Isla's choice narrows options. Cost is legible in the "fury rising" and the condensation messages. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies emerges through images like the unsent letters and gargoyle shard, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the lines "I'm sorry. I should have listened" forming in condensation. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "mangrove roots twisted like frozen thoughts." Voice modulates under pressure, and elision in the memory shift is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as with the medium's layered voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "spirits' songs wrapping around Isla's ribs" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates in peaks, such as the memory revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like the gargoyle shard and unsent letters synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious premise. Risk-taking in the mosaic structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The transformation of familiar tropes through specific details feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
