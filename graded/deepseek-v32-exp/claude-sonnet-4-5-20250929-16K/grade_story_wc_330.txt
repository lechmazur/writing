<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carpenter's silent persistence and sudden singing are earned through concrete actions and embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from silence to song is motivated by the discovery and restoration, foreclosing her old path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the fuller silence and turning carousel. The wrong turn initiates a coherent progression to the climax, and orientation is clear early. The halo fragment's gleam charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with sensory details like "wind bells like water remembering music" filtering through POV. The train car and carousel constrain choices and charge the closure, as the halo fragment's light multiplies in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through density increases in her work leading to singing, driven by her agency. The cost is legible in the transformed silence and the carousel's motion, reweighting possibility from ruin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as possibility emerges organically from images and actions, not statement, with subtext in the humming and wind bells. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the carousel turning, resisting moralizing for resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature like "sound like water remembering music." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the singing climax, and elision (e.g., her past) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and enhances clarity, e.g., "mist threading between the cattails," and peak beats maintain momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of silence, ruin, and renewal feels inevitable, with specific details like the halo fragment and wind bells. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering a fresh angle on transformation.</comment>
