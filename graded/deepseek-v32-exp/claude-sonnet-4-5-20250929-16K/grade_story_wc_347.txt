<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory, balancing hatred for the orchard with unwelcome duty. Her final acceptance of her role is earned through the nut's discovery and the guiding act, with visible cost in her continued imprisonment. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the blueprint, reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; the nut's discovery triggers a because/therefore sequence leading to the hikers' rescue and Maren's realization. Closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost—her freedom foreclosed—legible in "Someone had to stay." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the curse shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the orchard's labyrinth and mechanical birds pressuring choices through reforming paths and patrol patterns. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "brass wings catching the late afternoon light." The nut as a micro-setting object constrains navigation and charges the final image with its dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saving hikers before night frost escalates under causal lens through Maren's agency with the blueprint. Cost is legible in her renewed commitment to the orchard, foreclosing escape. One meaningful tightening occurs as the frost deadline approaches, narrowing options and deepening the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cursed duty as gift emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the "graceless beauty" of transformations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing, as Maren understands being "chosen." Subtext operates through gesture and implication, like the birds' clicking as applause.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("like a desperate memory"). Voice modulates under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the blueprint's conceptual assembly) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "fruit that screamed when picked." No register drift or artifice in peak beats; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and conceptual blueprint with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the nut's engravings. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure commits fully to its implications.</comment>
