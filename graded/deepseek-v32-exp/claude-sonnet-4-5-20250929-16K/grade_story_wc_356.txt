<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is dramatized in scene, such as staying with the blooming flower despite nausea, and the final transformation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The quick test is satisfied with contradictory impulses acting in scene and earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lirien finds stillness within motion, with felt cost in her endured nausea and journaling. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory details and reflection. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her sensitivity shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, such as the treetop village's swaying platforms and the corpse flower's stench, which constrains choices (e.g., planting at the platform's edge) and charges the final image of Lirien swaying with stillness. The environment actively pressures character decisions and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirien's agency under the Accumulative lens, from seed planting to enduring the bloom, with cost legible in her nausea and journaling. The dominant stake of mastering serenity tightens through the flower's bloom, forcing a trade-off and foreclosing prior options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the journal entries and corpse flower's reek, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to cultivating presence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like doodling and elders' silence, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Lirien's olfactory sensitivity; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision in journaling. Dialogue is natural and sparse, carrying subtext, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion. No artifacts obscure causality or closure, and sentence-level craft supports emotional beats effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (herbalist, corpse flower) through specific character choices and setting, with risk-taking in confronting sensitivity heightening stakes. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
