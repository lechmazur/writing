<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and luminescence are consistently embodied, driving her motive to liberate memories. Her final choice to open the box is earned through prior causality, with visible cost as her glow fades. Internal conflict between doubt and duty is shown in scene, not summarized. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional flatlining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: Mara's glow fades as memories are released, and the city restores. Hybrid lens (causal-accumulative) holds, with sidereal patience shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "Mara's glow began to fade." No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with fountains constraining choices and charging the final image as they "remember their purpose." Sensory details like "stone basins collecting only leaves" are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent during Mara's journey. No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring memories escalates through Mara's agency in following breadcrumbs and placing shards. Cost is unmistakable as her luminescence fades, foreclosing her role. Under hybrid lens, pressure tightens via causal linkages and pattern completion. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, patience, and skepticism emerges implicitly from events and images, such as the geese pause and fountains' restoration. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the "defiant hush." No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; Mara's poetic yet skeptical voice remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression, as in "sidereal patience," is taught and pays off. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "stuck between moments like an insect in amber," is purposeful and clear. Sentence propulsion varies with scene needs. No overwriting, mixed metaphors, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes magical realism with memory loss in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the geese pause and luminous skepticism. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative template or near-echoes.</comment>
