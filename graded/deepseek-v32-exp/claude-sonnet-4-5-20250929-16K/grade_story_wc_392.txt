<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final decision to act is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fortified vulnerability. The entangled memories deepen motivation without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—Sara's readiness to "let her findings reverberate" risks her career. The Causal lens holds via because/therefore linkages in her investigation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The subway tunnel constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory details like water dripping and the lantern's flame woven into action. The environment pressures Sara's tactics, and spatial choreography remains clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Sara's agency under the Causal lens, as empirical observation narrows options and reveals the murder. The dominant stake (truth vs. career) tightens with cost legible in her accumulated evidence and personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from the lantern's legacy and Sara's rebellion, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "truth as its own kind of freedom," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in Sara's biased noticing of clues and echoes. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and any elision (e.g., memory fragments) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "symphony of persistence," serves atmosphere without muddle. Sentence propulsion accelerates with discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical legacy and modern corruption feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the entangled memories concept. Specific details, like the lantern and tunnel, avoid template plots and heighten stakes.</comment>
