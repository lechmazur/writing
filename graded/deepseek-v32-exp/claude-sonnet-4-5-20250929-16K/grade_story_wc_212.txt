<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is vividly embodied in phrases like "furiously tranquil," and her decision to forgo the vortex is earned through prior causality, with the cost of borrowed time legible on the page. Micro-choices, such as withdrawing her hands, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flaws detract from the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis, as she renounces the vortex with a felt cost ("she would age years in moments"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear early, with the icebound atrium and stolen seeds anchoring the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and acorn cap function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "breath forming crystals" woven into action. Starlight and the frozen fountain reflect internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by her agency in testing the vortex's cost, leading to a decisive withdrawal. The dominant stake—restoring potential vs. accepting loss—tightens meaningfully, with the price of entropy deferred made unmistakable in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's struggle with time and entropy, culminating in a non-literal answer through her choice to "discover the grain of time earned." Subtext operates in gestures like pocketing the acorn cap, avoiding moralizing while offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("wild serenity") that modulates under pressure. The prose maintains rhythmic control without head-hopping or register drift, and elision (e.g., the vortex mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, such as "texture of borrowed time," is coherent and purpose-driven, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of heirloom preservation with time manipulation feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the acorn cap. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
