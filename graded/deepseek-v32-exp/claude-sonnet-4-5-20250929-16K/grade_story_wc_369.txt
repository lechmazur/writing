<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in curiosity and duty. Her interiority is concrete, exemplified by the embodied healing of her thumb, which earns the epiphany. Micro-choices under pressure, like reconstructing the sextant, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance and realization are earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the labyrinth's purpose is reconfigured with felt cost in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns and revelations. Orientation is clear early, and the pin drop inciting incident pays off. Persistent constraints like the beam shape tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the labyrinth paths constraining movement and the moonlight enabling healing. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's POV. The ancient beam charges the final image, constraining the reconstruction and revealing memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is discovering the truth about sorrow and healing, escalating through Kael's agency in investigating and reconstructing the sextant.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the sextant and tree rings, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to quantified sorrow versus unquantifiable grace. Subtext operates through images and implications, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
