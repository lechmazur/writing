<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to discover hidden secrets is clear and rooted in childhood experience, driving his actions consistently. His observant nature and ghost-seeing ability are integrated without stock phrasing, and the final choice to document the photos is earned with visible cost. Minor lack of deep internal conflict prevents a higher score, but embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as the ghost fades and truth is revealed, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages without breaks. The mainspring barrel's loosening and building's exhale provide a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like rust and old popcorn filtering through Marcus's POV. The abandoned circus ticket office and elevator shaft constrain choices, and the cracks in the ceiling charge the final image by leading to the evidence. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through Marcus's agency, from engaging with the ghost to finding and documenting the evidence. Cost is legible in the ghost's peace and the building's release, narrowing options meaningfully under the causal lens. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and justice emerges organically from events and images, such as the weightless burden and cracks in the façade. Subtext operates in the ghost's desperation and Marcus's motivation, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Marcus's observational voice consistent under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the ghost's lines. Perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision is taught and paid off, such as in the dust analysis setting up his skill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "weightless burden" is effective and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs. No overwriting or register drift; clarity and concision maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of elevator repair and ghost-seeing, with specific details like the mainspring barrel transforming tropes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in combining supernatural and procedural elements heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
