<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's defiance and artistic motivation are clear and consistent, driving her to attempt refracting truth through poetry. Her internal conflict is embodied in her actions and realizations, with the final acceptance earned by the night's efforts. The cost of her choice is visible in her gathering paints and walking toward the spire, showing a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira accepts the undivided truth, walking toward the spire with visible cost. The causal lens holds tightly, with her poetry sessions leading inevitably to the realization that amplification, not refraction, occurred. Orientation is anchored early, and the constraint of the canyon shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon setting are vividly specific and constrain choices, as Mira uses the echoes for her poetry. The pale spire charges the final image, emerging from mist as a symbol of judgment. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, reflecting Mira's perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as her poetry sessions intensify the conflict between seeking mercy and facing judgment. The stakes tighten through her failed attempt to refract truth, leading to a cost legible in her acceptance of the undivided reality. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, exploring truth, forgiveness, and art's consequences without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mira's acceptance, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the poetry and canyon echoes, embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Mira's artist mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., the poetry's effect) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the realization scene. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and the final image is sharp and uncontaminated by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar tropes (judgment, art's power) with fresh, specific elements like bone towers and echo poetry. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, driven by character choice and world logic.</comment>
