<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her condition; her internal conflict is embodied in moments like the neighbor's visit, and her final choice to use the eye is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The rational mind balancing risks shows contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—the door closing sensation—and felt cost under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the virus shapes tactics. The ending image of private fear reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the hanging orchard and storms constraining choices (e.g., retreating to cabin) and charging the final image of resilience. Sensory details like rope bridges and horizontal rain are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from finding the eye to using it, with cost legible in her fear without projection. The dominant stake of psychological safety tightens through her choices, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the glass eye and storms, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to privacy vs. empathy without moralizing. Subtext in images like "fractured grace" deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure (e.g., "sensation like a door closing") and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "door closing softly"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of post-empathy virus with occluders, transformed through specific details like the hanging orchard and discredited textbooks. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
