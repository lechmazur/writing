<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is deeply rooted in her backstory and internal conflict, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to transmit is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in scene. However, minor summarization of internal state slightly reduces peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (risk of execution), and the causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to transmission. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of the Authority shapes tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vividly rendered and integral, constraining choices (ice as network) and charging the final image with sensory purpose. Snow and ice motifs are woven into action, avoiding generic description. Micro-setting elements like the vault pulse with narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of truth vs. safety escalate through Kael's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a legible cost at transmission. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and silence emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in the letter and networks. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet precise, filtered through Kael's expertise. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes frozen archives and contraband truths with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids template plots.</comment>
