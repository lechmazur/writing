<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is rooted in tangible guilt and a search for connection, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, ink-stained fingers) and micro-choices under pressure. The final tattoo choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her path of running with visible cost—the dissolution of the firefly and easing of dissonance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her initial confusion giving way to understanding, without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—"the dissonance that had lived in her chest... began to ease"—under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterns of sound, letters, and time build coherence. The amber and firmware persist as constraints shaping tactics, and orientation is anchored early ("laboratory of lost sounds," Mira's role). No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setting pressures choices by housing the firmware and letters, while the amber pendant constrains the climax—inserted into the device and dissolved into ink—charging the final image of the empty pendant as a "promise kept." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "meteor hush," ink color), avoiding generic description. Spatial choreography remains clear despite time folds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from firmware messages to using the amber, culminating in the tattoo that forecloses her guilt with cost—the empty pendant and eased dissonance. The dominant stake (internal reconciliation) tightens through each beat, and no coincidence resolves conflict; her choices narrow options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—forgiveness and self-understanding via the amber, firmware, and tattoos—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "forgiveness sounds like silence after the echo finally fades," reweighting prior motifs. Subtext operates in letters and implied guilt, and emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "meteor hush," constellation mapping) and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (time folds) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent, and diction aligns with her introspective, poetic worldview without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere (e.g., "amber holds ancient insects"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors are consistent and purposeful. Line-level propulsion accelerates toward closure, and word choice is specific without thesaurus-itis, maintaining clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes constellation tattooist, lost sounds, and time folding into a fresh, non-obvious angle, transformed through specific character choices and emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure (time folds, letters) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision prevails.</comment>
