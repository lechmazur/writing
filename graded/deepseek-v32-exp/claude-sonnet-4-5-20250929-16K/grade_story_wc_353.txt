<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices; embodied emotion (e.g., bleeding fingers) and micro-choices under pressure are strengths, but the absence of internal conflict or contradictory impulses prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing (silence transforming music) and felt cost (bleeding fingers) under a coherent accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the grove and sculpture charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, and the environment constrains choices through the responsive vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in strumming, with visible cost; stakes tighten under the accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shift, leading to a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about music's transformation; no moralizing, and subtext operates through vibration and motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with tropes transformed through grounded details; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
