<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her gift/curse, with interiority shown through embodied actions like wrapping hands and sorting memories. Her resilience under pressure and the earned choice to transform remorse demonstrate credible endurance. The final stasis forecloses a path with visible cost in the pavilion's collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing where the pavilion collapses after memories are processed, reweighting the premise with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of her ability shapes tactics. The cost is legible in the image of ice weeping and stones feeling lighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the coral icebound pavilion and tidal pools constraining Maren's choices by serving as the medium for memory work. The environment charges the final image of collapse and transformation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming remorse escalates under the Accumulative lens through Maren's agency in sorting and softening memories, narrowing options as she resists being subsumed. Cost is legible in the pavilion's decomposition and the foreclosed path of continued preservation. One meaningful tightening occurs through her disciplined work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief transforming into grace emerges organically from concrete actions and images, such as the pavilion collapsing and the morning feeling like forgiveness.

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with lyrical but purposeful figurative language.

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory-tasting, coral pavilion, and stored remorse into a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight.
