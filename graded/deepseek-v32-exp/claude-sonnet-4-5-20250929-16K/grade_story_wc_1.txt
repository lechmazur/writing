<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., retracing numbers) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transition from seeking silence to active resolution is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the chest-loosening realization. The "steadily adaptive" trait is demonstrated through scarred hands and will, avoiding label-only usage. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the diminishing knowledge instead freeing her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (return to testify and create) with felt cost ("something loosened in her chest"). Causal lens holds tightly: ledger discovery → canyon reflection → pattern recognition → recalled patron → resolved action. Orientation is immediate and clear. Persistent constraint (ledger's gaps) shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is essential and constrains choice: the canyon's frost patterns directly enable the ledger insight, charging the final image. Sensory details (stone warmth, star shadows, frost retreat) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elena's artistic POV. The environment evolves causally from night to dawn, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Elena's retracing of numbers narrows options and leads to the patron realization. Dominant stake (finding meaning) tightens through a meaningful deepening, with cost legible in her emotional reconfiguration. No coincidence resolves conflict; the pattern discovery forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the frost and glass motifs culminate in a non-literal answer about meaning accumulating "like condensation." Subtext operates through image and implication (e.g., "geography" realization). No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without statement, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elena's glass-artist perspective (e.g., "light could become trapped"). Voice modulates under pressure while maintaining poetic consistency. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., ledger analysis) is taught and legible. Diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("drifting resonance... like the hum of cooling glass") is precise and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and closure image is undimmed by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the specific synthesis of glass art and criminal investigation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded character detail and moral calculus, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
