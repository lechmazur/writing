<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her observant nature. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling the house "exhale." Her final realization and decision to participate are earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her changed perspective. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost as Maya understands the "language of displaced things." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the house's memory acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "hammered silver" water and lilac scent. The house itself constrains choices and charges the final image through displaced objects. Micro-setting elements, such as the orris root, are integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maya's understanding, escalating through her agency under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to place the orris root and plan to help narrows options with visible cost. Pressure coheres and deepens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as displaced objects mapping memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, embracing complexity through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature for Maya. Prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression, such as in the "hushed blaze" realization. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "streetlights daydreamed." No overwriting or register drift; clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing memory and place through displaced objects. Emotional truth arises from specific details like the orris root curing for three years. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
