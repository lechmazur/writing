<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure with embodied emotion and micro-choices like placing the sand grain. However, internal conflict between progress and preservation is noted but not deeply dramatized with contradictory impulses in scene, slightly limiting depth. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the crater is immortalized in photos, with cost legible in the "dawnlit melancholy" and impending destruction. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive density to a decisive image. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the regolith terrain and timed sunrise pressure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional bias. The lunar environment directly charges the final image of the "golden" crater, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. progress escalates under the accumulative lens through the impending dawn and Maya's agency in setting beacons. Cost is legible in the loss of the crater but preservation of its memory. One meaningful tightening occurs, though external conflict with the consortium remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges organically through images like the sand grain and chemical fire, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the photos reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic yet controlled prose that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, such as the compressed reflection on her grandfather, taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "waterfalls of light" slightly strains coherence but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of lunar preservation via chemical messages feels fresh and specific, synthesizing familiar tropes through grounded details like the hourglass sand. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on emotional templates.</comment>
