<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied emotion under pressure. His tranquilly perceptive nature is shown through methodical actions, and his final choice to document and keep the stamp is earned with visible cost. However, the trait is occasionally told rather than fully dramatized in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early. Closure lands as a decisive change—Marcus possesses proof and plans to share it—with cost felt in lines like "Each click of the shutter felt like resistance." The blackout enables access but doesn't resolve the conflict coincidentally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sunken library and ocean pressure constraining choices (e.g., blackout allowing archive access). Sensory details like "creak of settling architecture" reflect POV urgency, and the stamp as a micro-object charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes (uncovering truth) escalate through Marcus's agency, from discovery to archive search amid security risk. Cost is legible in prioritized photographing and pocketing the stamp under pressure. One meaningful tightening forecloses options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges through particulars like the ink stamp and ocean imagery, with subtext in "forgetting wasn’t the same as erasing." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, rooted in character struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet precise prose reflects Marcus's focus. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., hypothesis formation) is taught and paid off. Rhythm controls pressure, as in "anger and determination flickering."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language ("like light through deep water") enhances without muddle. Momentum sustained through strategic telling and concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sunken city conspiracy with library mystery in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details (e.g., ink stamp as heritage token) and quiet climax transform tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative tension heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
