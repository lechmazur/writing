<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rediscover joy is clear and intensifies through her choice to amplify the fresco, revealing embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between melancholy and delight is shown in scene, and the final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—Mira redefines joy as ephemeral and connected—under the accumulative/textural lens, which holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of ephemerality shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog constrain choices (e.g., fog as canvas) and charge the final image with vivid, sensory details. Setting is integrated into action and perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in amplifying the fresco and streaming the display, tightening the stake of rediscovering joy under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her emotional realization and the ephemeral nature of the art.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy in ephemeral connections emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the fresco and light painting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Mira's artist lens filters perception—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats; rhythm supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of painting with light in a ruined world feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional authenticity avoids generic templates.</comment>
