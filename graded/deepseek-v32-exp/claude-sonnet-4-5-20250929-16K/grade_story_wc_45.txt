<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dr. Cole's characterization is deeply embodied, with her skepticism cracking open "like an egg" and micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final choice to help Thomas is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her new certainty. Thomas's "shrewdly innocent" trait is shown through action and dialogue, not label-only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Thomas steps into the light, reconfiguring Maren's understanding with felt cost. Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident through climax, with no orientation debt. The constellation's glow and Maren's carried certainty charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the garden's "crystalline flowers" and "bioluminescent patterns" filtering through Maren's POV to constrain choices and charge the closure. The garden acts as a micro-setting that directly enables the bone-setting resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of helping Thomas home is signaled early and escalates through Maren's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a tightening choice with visible cost. Her work with the bones forecloses other options and reweights the stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of certainty and displacement emerges through concrete events like the bone constellation, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through Maren's new understanding. Subtext operates in gestures and images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with Maren's professional voice and perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, as in Thomas's harmonics that "make her teeth ache." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "cracking open like an egg" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes changeling lore and bone-setting in a fresh, non-obvious way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the mystical resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
