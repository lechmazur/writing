<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dalton's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., holding the vial, weeping only for the old scent). His motivation to understand grief intensifies compellingly, and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost when Dalton weeps only for the old scent, reweighting memory and grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds, driven by emotional density and pattern breaks, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (e.g., ultraviolet light, extinct blooms) filtered through Dalton's POV. Specificity is purposeful, enhancing atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Dalton's agency under the accumulative lens, from waiting for the bloom to comparing scents, with cost legible in his tears. Stakes tighten meaningfully, though the pace is quiet, fitting the textural drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with subtext in gestures (e.g., Miren's clinical compassion). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and grief without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Dalton's profession and grief. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, and prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "lantern's glass holds space for flame") is coherent and purposeful, enhancing closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, scent, and extinction feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet emotional stakes. Specific details (e.g., lantern broker, ultraviolet authentication) heighten coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
