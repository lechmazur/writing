<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliane's motivation is clear and rooted in her grounded nature, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her competence. However, internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses in scene, which prevents a higher score despite strong embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with clear causality from dream escape to capture; closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the dream's containment and planned burial. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the fog and ruined orchard pressuring choices and charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, constraining Eliane's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled with the dream's threat, and escalation is driven by Eliane's agency in attuning and capturing it under the causal lens; cost is felt in the boundary erosion and effort, though it lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries emerges organically through images and events, with the final mirror burial offering a resonant, non-literal answer; no moralizing, and subtext operates in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., fog's properties) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts; figurative language serves the atmosphere without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion supports the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of crystallized dreams and mirror work is fresh and organic, transforming tropes through specific details; risk-taking in premise heightens stakes without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar archetypes.</comment>
