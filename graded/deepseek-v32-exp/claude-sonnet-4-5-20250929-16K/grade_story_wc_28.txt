<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vessa's characterization is deeply integrated with her motives; her "gentle radical" nature is shown through specific augmentations and the final choice to prioritize mercy over justice, earned by prior causality with visible cost as she carries the truth alone. Internal conflict is embodied in her tactile interaction with the mosaic and the weight of her decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vessa chooses aberrant mercy, with cost legible in "another weight in her steel hands"; causal drive lens holds tightly from discovery to decision, and the persistent constraint of retrocognition shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the "shattered sky" and "ancient plaza" constraining choices and charging the final image; the mosaic tessera acts as micro-setting that directly enables the climax and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. mercy escalates through Vessa's agency under the causal lens; her choice to remove the tessera narrows options with unmistakable cost, foreclosing justice for communal hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from particulars like Davos's complexity and Vessa's stance; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "cradling empathy in arms of steel" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates poetically under pressure, and elision (e.g., retrocognitive visions) is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "fractured light" serves momentum without muddle, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes retrocognition and moral dilemma with originality; specific choices in character and world make the synthesis feel inevitable, and risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
