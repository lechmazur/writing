<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between scientific purity and acceptance of mess is embodied through concrete observations; her final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality with visible cost in leaving dust on her hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of dust on skin, and persistent dust patterns shape Mara's tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse and dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting Mara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in documenting dust patterns, leading to a deepening stake with cost unmistakable in her acceptance of mess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges from particulars like dust and decay; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic diction; no head-hopping, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or figurative muddle; sentence-level craft supports rhythm and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and greenhouse decay feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
