<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is deeply rooted in her backstory, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the misaligned harp and crocodile tooth. Her "modest fearlessness" is embodied in action, and the ghost's transformation is earned through causal interaction. The final choice to integrate laughter with grief forecloses a path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost when the ghost glows and fades, reconfiguring the theme under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The crocodile tooth and harp mechanics shape tactics, contributing to a coherent structure with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice through its acoustic properties and charges the final image with "luminous ache." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV, such as "spectral confessions echoing off stone walls." The environment actively pressures the narrative, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she pursues the ghost and uses the harp to deepen emotional stakes. The cost is legible when the ghost laughs and moves on, narrowing options and foreclosing guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs through the interaction, with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the misaligned harp and crocodile tooth, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing through integration of grief and joy. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, such as "wrong notes made right," without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction like "shepherd of the wandering" and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression, such as "luminous ache," is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, and dialogue (when present) carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language, like "crooked wing," is coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image resonates with concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a lost soul collector using a misaligned harp synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh, grounded details, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. The closure effect is bolstered by unique elements like the crocodile tooth.</comment>
