<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory and role; her internal conflict between duty and memory preservation is embodied in micro-choices like collecting photographs and writing the proposal. The final choice to defy the county is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her insubordination, foreclosing the path of compliance. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as when she hesitates after the radio call, deepening character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara's actions lead to the town's resurfacing as living memory, cost legible in the emotional impact on visitors and the symbolic wind chime. The causal drive lens holds strong, with because/therefore linkages from the drought revealing the town to Mara's discovery and defiance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "skeletal structures" and "mirrored hush" filtered through Mara's POV, reflecting urgency and internal states. The environment constrains choices, as the drought reveals the town, forcing Mara's actions, and the ridgeway and reservoir charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the path from ridge to mudbank tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory versus erasure escalates through Mara's agency, as her discovery of photographs leads to active defiance, narrowing options and incurring cost from county backlash. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the causal lens, with a meaningful tightening when she writes the proposal instead of the hazard report. Cost is felt in the supervisor's call and the emotional weight of the resurfaced memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges organically through particulars like the photographs and liqueur label, without direct statement, subtextually enriched by the county's desire to expunge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the wind chime's restoration, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from Mara's specific experience and struggle, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's professional yet lyrical voice, e.g., "defiant purple threads." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in the radio exchange, advancing plot with subtext. Purposeful compression, like the elision between scenes, is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures and concrete imagery advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, such as "skeletal structures like accusations," is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh angle on a drowned town resurfacing, transformed through specific character-driven choices and emotional specificity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet closure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Details like the wind chime and photographs are particular and indispensable, avoiding derivative premises.</comment>
