<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied internal conflict and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her reluctance and change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's metamorphosis, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the fortune's wisdom shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard and permanent moonlight constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details woven through action. The environment pressures Mira's transformation and integrates with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from using spices to letting go, with cost legible in her blurred edges. The dominant stake (reforging the bond) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant transformation emerges through particulars like the fortune and spices, with a resonant non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical prose, and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting is present but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like beast whispering and phoenix lore, transformed via specific character choices. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
