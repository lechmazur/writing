<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's blithe nature and consistent motivation drive her discovery; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., decoding the tapestry) revealing character. The final choice to plant a rose is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mira decides to plant the rose, reconfiguring memory with felt emotional weight; causal lens holds tightly from discovery to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the ending image makes the cost legible in the "cobalt silence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the cobalt silo constraining choice and charging the final image; sensory details like "velveteen gloom" are POV-filtered and purposeful. The environment actively shapes tactics, such as the silo's isolation enabling the decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in decoding the tapestry, narrowing options and deepening knowledge under the causal lens; cost is legible in her emotional response and the decision to honor the love story. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, though no major reversals occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "uncharted echoes" emerges through particulars like the tapestry and letters, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, with the final image reweighting prior material authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect Mira's mind under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the decoding process) is taught and paid off. Voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "velveteen gloom" is purposeful and clear. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and closure is undimmed by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality stems from a fresh synthesis of elements like tapestry decoding and love letters, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
