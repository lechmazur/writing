<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Old Chen's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits and micro-choices, such as whistling back to acknowledge labor, with interiority embodied in net-mending and philosophy. Her motivation to teach the girl feels earned through prior causality, and the final choice to pass on knowledge forecloses other paths with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like audacity in defacing temples complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns of hidden effort building to a Charged Poise closure as Chen prepares to teach. Closure lands on-page with cost in her dedication ("ready to make strong what had been broken"). Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of hidden patterns shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "slick stone" and "firefly season" filtered through Chen's POV. The parapet and bamboo whisk function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; details evolve with the scene's mood without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort escalates through Chen's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her reflections and decisions tighten toward teaching. Cost is legible in her renunciation of glory for mending nets. One meaningful deepening occurs when she connects the whisk to the girl's equations, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images like net-mending and whistling, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to hidden effort through the final image of preparation. Subtext operates in gestures and silences; no moralizing or thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Chen, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic prose and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with pressure, as in the whistled tune carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., moon paths) is taught and pays off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "Droplets scattered... matched the equations." Clarity and concision prevail; no register drift or artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of philosophy and mundane work feels inevitable, with specific details like the asymmetrical whisk transforming tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration of hidden effort; no derivative premise or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
