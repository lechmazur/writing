<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as her patient work with the valve. The final choice to take the first boat out is earned by prior causality, though interior contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Maris's success reconfigures the fishermen's relationship with the sea, under a causal lens. The valve's repurposing charges the final image, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "wept" cliffs and salt air, constraining choices through the sea's forgetfulness. The harbor tower and valve function as micro-settings that charge the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (fishermen's inability to fish), escalating through Maris's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in her weeks of work and the risk of her first voyage, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation and memory emerges through particulars like the valve's transformation, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the valve singing anew.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled. Dialogue is natural and advances plot, such as the harbormaster's worry, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold issues; closure image is sharp with "the wind and sang."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of ocean-spray archivist and navigated absences, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in the reactive visionary trait heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
