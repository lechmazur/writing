<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his father's legacy, with interiority shown through concrete reflections. His micro-choices, like not warning the prisoners, reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The final decision to speak is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his separation from inherited shame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Marcus realizes hush is something he becomes, reweighting his pursuit with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by the lattice and tide imagery. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints like his father's shadow shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like copper light and jagged reefs, constraining choices (e.g., lattice for confession, tide revealing bodies). The environment charges the final image, with no generic elements; spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict escalates through Marcus's reflections and the impending body discovery. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases lead to his agency-driven decision to speak, with cost legible in the risk of disbelief. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth and inheritance emerges organically through images like the lattice and hush, with subtext in silence and light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Marcus's realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature (e.g., dust as "suspended secrets"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., backstory) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or overwriting. Figurative language, such as "copperlight repose," enhances clarity without muddle. Sentences advance story and character consistently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes the cry wolf trope with a fresh, specific setting and internal journey. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
