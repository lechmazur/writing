<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her calm entry and decision to feed the pigeon. Her final choice to create parallel documentation is earned by her established integrity and curiosity, with visible cost in added labor. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she commits to completeness, with cost legible in her resolve to bear witness fully. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the message tube incident triggers a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the courtyard acting as a micro-setting that constrains choice by serving as her sanctuary. The fountain and ivy charge the final image of solitude, and sensory details like the "amber-lit streets" are purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. evacuation) escalates through protagonist agency: the message forces a lateral decision, narrowing options with cost in added documentation work. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though no multiple reversals are needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and complexity emerges organically from events like the pigeon message and her parallel project, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("truth required more than accuracy"). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., noting "exhausted posture" of pigeon). Voice is meticulous and rhythmic, elision is taught and paid off in closure, and no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "layered tranquility of the courtyard"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes storm recording and quarantine zone with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Lateral thinking feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
