<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marin's characterization is consistent and motivating; her adaptable and methodical nature drives key choices, such as reconfiguring the rope, which is earned by prior causality. The final action demonstrates a credible endurance with visible cost in the merged timelines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from discovery to closure; the door manifestation incites action, and the timeline merge is a decisive change with cost legible in the solidified room and merged notebooks. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, from the clock tower's tick-tick-tick to the impossible room's wrong geometry, constraining choices like careful movement. The ceremonial rope and wax seal charge the final image, enhancing closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes around merging timelines escalate through Marin's agency, driven by her quest for clarity; the reconfiguration choice narrows options with cost evident in the stabilized documents. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence and clarity emerges organically from events, not statement; the ending reweights prior material through the merged timelines without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, methodical voice reflecting Marin's priorities; prose rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping, and elision (e.g., the door's mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "reality seemed to hiccup") serves clarity, and peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously blends archival work with temporal divergence, feeling inevitable in hindsight; specific details like the wax seal and rope braiding transform tropes through grounded choices, heightening stakes.</comment>
