<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a translator is deeply rooted and compels her higher-stakes choice to help the child; the final decision to "unknot every story" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in their shared grief. The child's "shrewdly innocent" stillness and the cast's notes reveal character under pressure through concrete, embodied emotion. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is specific and contradictory impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as they begin translating grief into remembrance; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with details building to a meaningful cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is tight from meeting to shared decision. The brain coral fragment and cast notes charge the final image, shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting (atrium, fountain, twilight) is vivid and selective, with mist and sensory details mirroring internal states and constraining choices by enabling intimacy. The cast functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image and directly shapes the climactic action of decryption. No generic placeholder; spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against loss) escalates under the Accumulative lens through Maya's agency in offering to translate, deepening their connection and foreclosing isolation with a visible emotional cost. One meaningful tightening occurs as the child's vulnerability prompts Maya's decisive shift from observer to participant. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and translation emerges organically through particulars (coral, cast scripts) without direct statement; subtext operates in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "grafting new meaning onto old wounds," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (translator's cataloging mind); voice modulates under morphine haze but remains coherent. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the girl's quiet revelations. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., anesthetic effect) is taught and pays off in the dreamlike tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("lotus-hearted ache") is purposeful and legible, enhancing peak beats without muddle. Sentences advance story and character; read-aloud ear test passes with natural momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of translator, coral, and child's cast feels inevitable and fresh; tropes are transformed through specific, grounded details in conflict zones. Risk-taking in quiet emotional resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on memory and displacement.</comment>
