<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is deeply integrated with her chess background, driving her methodical decoding; her internal conflict between pride and regret culminates in an earned self-forgiveness with visible cost in her tearful confession. The trait "fidgets productively" is shown through action, constraining her approach. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; emotions are embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change via self-forgiveness that breaks the curse, with cost legible in the village's return to life and Elena's tears; causal lens holds tightly from exile to resolution. Orientation is anchored early, and the tapestry acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the time-frozen village and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "dust motes hung motionless" are filtered through Elena's POV. Micro-setting (tapestry) directly alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elena's internal conflict, escalating through her agency in decoding the tapestry; cost is unmistakable in her confession and the village's release. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs as she narrows options to the emotional labyrinth's solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges organically through the tapestry decoding and Elena's arc, with subtext in "woven hush"; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via villagers relearning "the language between heartbeats." Avoids moralizing, though "mistakes made honestly" slightly leans explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elena's chess tutor perspective shaping perception ("winnow away distraction"); voice is lyrical and controlled, e.g., "space between one heartbeat and the next." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffolding; figurative language like "woven hush" is consistent and clarity is maintained. Sentences advance story efficiently, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes time-frozen village and emotional labyrinth with originality; specific details like platinum labyrinth feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming forgiveness tropes.</comment>
