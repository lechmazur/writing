<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices like the accidental graffiti error and the cooperative proposal, with interior contradiction driving credible evolution. The foundation stone chip's reweighting from anchor to seed charges her final stance with earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the council vote and transformed hope—under a causal lens, cost legible in the compromise's emotional weight. The foundation stone chip persists as a constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft city carnival setting pressures choices through decaying platforms and graffiti-covered surfaces, constraining Mira's actions and charging the final mural image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from encoded resistance to cooperative reorganization, with cost legible in the emotional shift and foreclosed options. The three-week deadline tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the chip's transformation and graffiti reconfiguration, offering a resonant non-literal answer to preservation vs. evolution without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Marcus's whispered warnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mira's orderly intuitive decoding of graffiti. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision in encoded messages is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "hopeful desperation" is purposeful, and sentence propulsion accelerates with pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft city carnival and graffiti-encoded resistance form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in dual allegiance and cooperative model heightens stakes without gimmickry, grounded in specific detail.</comment>
