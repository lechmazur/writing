<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying as she transitions from solitary weaver to community activator. Her sleepwalking and subsequent actions reveal embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as marking paths with stones and sewing panels. The final choice to join the walkers is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation of the labyrinth. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, from sleepwalking discoveries to communal revival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the labyrinth fulfilled through participation) with felt cost in the shift from neglect to use. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure adheres to single-POV defaults with one meaningful tightening. The final image of bodies threading through channels makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—red canyon, wharf, labyrinth—and constrains choices, such as the tide pools emptying enabling access. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Mara's POV, like "red dust coating her nightgown." The labyrinth as micro-setting charges the final image and alters tactics, supporting the theme. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. active reverence) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency—sewing panels, inviting walkers—under the causal lens. A meaningful tightening occurs when the council arrives, forcing a trade-off with visible cost in the labyrinth's transformation. Pressure coheres and grows, with resolution earned through protagonist alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—weaving as communal ritual—without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the storybook plate reweighting meaning. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "perpetual, communal becoming," avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "like a wooden prayer." Perceptual signature is consistent, and diction matches Mara's worldview. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present (e.g., elder and child). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, as in "the labyrinth woke slowly, hauntingly, optimistically." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, but clarity remains uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing labyrinth lore with weaving metaphors, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like sleepwalking as unconscious knowledge. Risk-taking in structure (e.g., mosaic elements) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
