<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in resilient positivity, driving his actions to save passengers. His interiority is shown through habitual actions and radio work, with micro-choices under pressure. However, contradictory impulses are minimal, and the steadfast nature limits the highest band, but the final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the timelines merging and hourglass refilling, under an Accumulative/Textural lens focused on pattern-building. Causality is tight, with Marcus's radio work driving the resolution. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the restored order and passengers disembarking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the ferry to the spectral grotto, with sensory details like bioluminescence constraining choices. The hourglass as a recurring object charges the final image, and environmental elements actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start—saving passengers—with escalation driven by Marcus's agency in weaving patterns via radio. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases as connections map, and cost is legible in the three-year struggle and successful convergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, centered on dispersion and reweaving, with subtext in images like the hourglass. The final line articulates it clearly but risks slight moralizing; however, it is earned through prior particulars and offers a resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that reflects Marcus's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., time anomalies) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum without obscuring peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of supernatural time disruption and human perseverance, with specifics like the radio patterns feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation through character depth avoids derivative traps.</comment>
