<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's guarded nature and ability to find lost things are consistently embodied, with interior contradiction shown when she unbends her defenses at personal cost. Her final choice to use the seed is earned by prior causality, and the cost of temporary self-loss is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost when the vortex stops and Kael gasps after the vision. Orientation is clear early, and the frozen confession concept shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex constrains Kael's search pattern and charges the final image of stillness. Sensory details like "ice-cold and pulsing" bark are selective and purposeful, filtered through her perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from spiraling inward to unbending defenses and using the seed. The cost of her unguarding is legible and narrows options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted truth emerging from particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the completed confession. No moralizing; subtext operates in the frozen words and Kael's sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature of "warlike serenity." Voice remains coherent under pressure, though minor convergence in descriptive phrasing prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "malevolent heart" is purposeful, and syntax accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frozen confession concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with specific details like the flesh-eating seed transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in magical logic heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
