<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adelaide's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits as a truth-seeker grappling with legacy. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to intervene is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses between protection and truth-seeking, with visible cost to family credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with the journalist's call inciting the conflict and Adelaide's reasoning leading to a decisive change. Closure lands on-page with cost (damage to legacy) as she commits to correcting the record. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (legacy vs. truth) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the observatory echoing internal chaos and constraining choices (descent symbolizing return to earth). Sensory details (clouds as lies, dome's acoustics) are POV-filtered. The rosewood pen nib charges the final image as evidence, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy) is signaled early and escalates through Adelaide's agency, using proof by contradiction and decision to intervene. Cost is legible in credibility damage. Under causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully with one key turn that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (orbits, clouds, stars), with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fall to earth and honest orbits, reweighting prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and poetic yet grounded, with dialogue natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision (proof method) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of newsprint heiress, observatory setting, and proof by contradiction, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
