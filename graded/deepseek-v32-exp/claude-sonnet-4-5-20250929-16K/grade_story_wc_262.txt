<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from search to release. Her internal conflict is embodied through tactile interactions with film strips, and the final choice to project the love is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost. The characterization avoids stock phrasing and shows genuine struggle, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Marina releases the unused love, reconfiguring her role under an accumulative/textural lens. The cost is legible in her weeping and smiling, and the lens holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres through patterned escalation to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The projection booth setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "hot metal and old celluloid" filtering through Marina's POV. The environment pressures her actions and integrates into the theme, avoiding generic description. The micro-setting of film strips functions as a tool that alters tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens, as her accumulation of goodbye letters leads to the decisive release. The stake of finding/unleashing love tightens through density increase, and the cost is unmistakable in the "hushed thunder" sensation. Protagonist choice forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the film strips and goodbye letters, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to unexpressed love.

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Marina's psychometry.
