<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his near-death experience, with interiority shown through concrete actions like counting heartbeats. His final choice to stop counting is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the relinquishment of control. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Marcus stops counting, legible cost in "finally whole in his beautiful brokenness." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of reflection and action coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the opal observatory and snow constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, such as "moonlight like a pearl," integrating environment with internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—reassembling life after near-death—escalating through Marcus's agency with ink and shard, leading to a tightening where he forecloses counting with felt cost. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, such as ink patterns representing ephemeral states, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to life/death boundaries. Subtext operates through gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., "digital ghost") is taught and paid off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "fractals blooming and dissolving," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of death certificate error and digital ghost, transformed through specific details like ink patterns. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids template plots.</comment>
