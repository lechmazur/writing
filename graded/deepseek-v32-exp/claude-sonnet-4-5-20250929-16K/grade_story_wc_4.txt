<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a puzzle archivist is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Secondary characters like Thomas add relevant pressure, but their development is minimal. The final community transformation feels earned through her agency, with visible cost in the shared healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the community decides to create a memorial garden, legible cost in transformed pain. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful; the lavender field and factory ruins constrain choices and charge the final image through reclamation. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with objects like the map case and photographs integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing escalates under Accumulative lens through Mira's arrangement and gathering crowd, with agency driving a meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the shift from individual to shared pain, though escalation is gradual rather than tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming pain into art emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with purposeful ambiguity; no moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, and dialogue is natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift, but minor convergence in secondary characters' voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats; sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a puzzle archivist and collective healing is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
