<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits—her shadow-sense and empathy drive her choices, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The leaders' backstories reveal internal conflicts and contradictions, earning the final reconstitution. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; motives intensify compellingly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: Kael's shadow-sense triggers revelations that lead to a decisive change in the leaders' stance. Closure lands with cost—the emotional crack in voices and shared smile—and the crystal fragment shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the structure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lighthouse orchard and ice floes pressure choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Kael's POV. The orchard constrains action (children playing) and mirrors internal states, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feud resolution) escalates through Kael's agency—her shadow-glimpses force a tightening that narrows options. Cost is legible in the leaders' trembling hands and cracked voices, driven by protagonist action under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reconstitution through empathy emerges organically from images (crystal, mirrors) and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the leaders' shared smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, intuitive voice modulates with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping. Elision (shadow-sense mechanics) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "voice cracked like spring ice." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of peacekeeper using darkness, reconstitution, and vintage mirrors feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (crystal fragment, orchard), and risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
