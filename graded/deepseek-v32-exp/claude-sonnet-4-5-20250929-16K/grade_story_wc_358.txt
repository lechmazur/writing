<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's teachings, with interiority shown through embodied actions like touching the patch. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as adapting the investigation scope, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final urgency in documentation is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the humming containers. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions in impulses are subtle but present in her learning arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Mara reconfigures the labyrinth as a teacher, with cost felt in her renewed documentation. Causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages from wind charts to convergence discovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent wind pressure constraint shapes tactics. Cost proof test passed with the final image of containers humming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the container labyrinth pressuring choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "metal canyons" and "columns of light." Environment constrains investigation and mirrors internal states. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Mara's professional POV. Micro-setting of wind charts functions as tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under causal lens, from finding wind charts to realizing atmospheric convergence, narrowing options with cost in her urgent documentation. Dominant stake of understanding collapse tightens through her discoveries. No coincidence; pressure coheres and grows. Cost is unmistakable in the growing pressure differential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of foresight emerges through events and images like the patch and wind patterns, without direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "labyrinth had become a teacher," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication. No moralizing or thematic echo; complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending professional observation with reflective tones. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "hazy precision" echoes throughout. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, and rhythmic control supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "containers hummed" is purposeful and coherent. Rhythm varies naturally; no register drift or artifacts in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with syntactic variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of structural investigation and atmospheric science, transformed through specific details like wind charts. Emotional truth in father-daughter legacy. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative templates.</comment>
