<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's compassionate nature is embodied through calloused hands and gentle actions; his internal conflict between hiding and acting is dramatized via micro-choices, and his final decision is earned by prior causality with visible cost in leaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias steps into the night; causal lens holds from invitation to reflection to action; orientation is clear early, and the ending reconfigures his stance with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly sensory and functionally constrains choice, serving as a micro-setting that pressures Elias's departure; its impossible paradoxes charge the final image of leaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency from internal gnawing to decisive action; the tension between safety and risk tightens meaningfully, culminating in a choice that forecloses his old life with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from paradoxes and mistakes; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the final sentence edges toward explicit statement without heavy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Elias's scholarly, empathetic lens; voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
