<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses—claustrophobia versus desire for space—are embodied in concrete micro-choices (e.g., stepping onto the trellis). Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the bunker's persistent pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise ("But so would the trellis. And so would she") with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the trellis as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (e.g., "silence tasted like ozone") are selective and POV-filtered. The trellis and doll function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Liora's agency (climbing, interacting with the boy), tightening through density increase. The cost of confinement versus possibility is legible on the page in the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (silence, doll, trellis) without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("listening to the flavors of different silences"). Lyrical voice modulates with pressure, and dialogue (though brief) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("gilded hush") is consistent and purposeful, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (claustrophobia, inverted world) through specific, grounded details like the xenial trellis. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
