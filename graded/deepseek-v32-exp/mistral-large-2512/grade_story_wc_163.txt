<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, interiority concrete, but internal contradiction under pressure is not deeply dramatized; final hesitation and departure feel earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost (hesitation, leaving); orientation clear early; feather's glow to map to chamber forms tight because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (time pressure, dome) and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) escalates via feather's glow, time constraint, and map; agency drives turns; cost legible in the forced departure and silent promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through imagery and action; subtext in fireflies as "shared exhale"; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (astrologer's attention to rhythms); voice is lyrical yet controlled; dialogue minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line-level propulsion supports pressure and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of speculative elements (landscape astrologer, living city) feels organic and inevitable; transformation of tropes through specific, charged particulars.</comment>
