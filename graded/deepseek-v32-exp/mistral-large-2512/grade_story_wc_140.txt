<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete traits; his interiority is specific and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (pocketing the certificate, searching the containers). The final shift to acceptance is earned by prior causality, though the contradictory impulses are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in the final image. Orientation is clear early; mosaic structure is taught and transitions are legible. Persistent constraints (tides, containers) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the container labyrinth and tides constraining choice and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Elias's perception, creating atmosphere that pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for memory texture) escalates through accumulative density and the encounter with the woman; agency is present but the turn (discovery of the name) is more revelatory than active. Cost is legible in Elias's relinquishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of layered histories emerges through concrete images and events; subtext in dialogue and final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, melancholic voice that filters perception character-specifically. Rhythmic control supports pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax; no loops or artifacts that obscure closure. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, enhancing atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing memory, identity, and setting into an organic whole. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative narrative pays off with a resonant closure; transformation through lived detail avoids template.</comment>
