<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation clear, with embodied emotion (numb hand healing). His change from seeing the tower as prison to vessel is earned, though internal contradiction is mild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in the final image of the pin falling and the trees' message. The sextant's transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral; the stormlit tower and moonlight actively shape choices and charge the final revelation. The sextant as object constrains and reconfigures the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency; the cost of accepting shared memory is felt. The dominant stake of understanding sorrow tightens as the sextant reveals its purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quantified sorrow emerges through resonant images; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and offerings enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied sentence rhythms and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (labyrinth, tower, magical instrument) into a fresh concept of measured sorrow; the ending feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
