<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory (wanting to untether but staying), with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Seris is slightly underdeveloped but serves the scene's pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost in the "furrowed hush" and the weight of the drawer pull. Orientation is immediate, the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the persistent talisman shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The parapet and mist pressure choices (chosen for precarious balance), and the drawer pull as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elias's urgency, with no static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exchange/recycling mistakes) tightens through the approaching dawn and object exchange. Escalation is driven by Elias's agency (showing the pull, taking the locket), with cost legible in the silent parting and the weight in his pocket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (drawer pull, moon phases) and subtext in dialogue. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the final line risks slight explicitness; wisdom is earned through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, melancholic, and tense. Voice modulates with emotional pressure, and dialogue (though sparse) is natural and goal-driven with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and controlled rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prisoner-exchange premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character introspection and symbolic objects. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in quiet tension and emotional specificity.</comment>
