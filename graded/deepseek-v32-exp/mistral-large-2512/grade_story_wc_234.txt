<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to capture presence is concrete and drives her micro-choices, and her final decision to share rather than capture is earned by the prior causality of Elias's return and her internal conflict. The cost of time is felt, and the relationship crucible forces a reconfiguration. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("she had expected anger, or at least suspicion") is present but does not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise (Resonant Reconfiguration) where Liora and Elias decide together, with the nexus humming; the cost of time is legible in Elias's admission and the reweighted nautilus curl. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through atmospheric and thematic accumulation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the nautilus curl pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember nexus and nautilus curl function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's alchemical perception. The setting's atmosphere (twilight, embers, humming) pressures the emotional stakes and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing/sharing presence) escalates through Liora's agency: Elias's return and the vial force a tightening choice. The cost of time is unmistakable on the page, and the final reconfiguration from capture to share reweights options under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—nautilus curl as map of time, distillation of presence—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: presence is to be shared, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in dialogue ("What did it cost you?" "Time.") and the final image's charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Liora) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic, alchemical diction and rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains consistent. No head-hopping; purposeful compression (e.g., "directed spontaneity") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in early sentences, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in peak beats. Final image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, time, and emotional resonance feels inevitable. The pocket-sun alchemist, nautilus curl as key, and revaluing the past are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific and avoids generic templates.</comment>
