<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling hands, heart a storm of envy). His final choice to confront Kael is earned by prior causality and his lifelong loneliness, with cost felt in the risk taken. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: radio voice prompts descent and confrontation. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the crowd's turn and Elias's solitary struggle. Orientation anchored early (observatory, stormlit night). No causality breaks; ending reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the observatory isolates Elias, the storm impedes descent, and the cobalt glass portico is pivotal in unfolding shadows. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV (auroras, biting cold). Spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (leadership of the new dawn) escalates through Elias's agency: from listening to descending to unfolding shadows. Cost is visible in the wavering allegiance and the storm risk. One meaningful tightening under causal lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: loneliness vs. leadership, ancient wisdom vs. charisma. Subtext in voice and shadows; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The dawn is not his to give..."). No moralizing; complexity in envy and ambition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice ("clawing at the stormlit sky," "lyrically prophetic"). Dialogue minimal but natural; perceptual signature selective. No head-hopping; elision taught (radio voices pay off at climax). Slight register consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with controlled figurative language ("static hissing like serpents"). Information density high; rhythm varies with scene urgency. No major loops or artifacts; "lyrically prophetic" is slightly label-like but not obstructive. Closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio whispers, cobalt glass, and ancient shadows transforms familiar tropes through specific setting and character. Risk-taking in lyrical tone; premise fully committed. No derivative echoes; originality heightens stakes.</comment>
