<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s characterization is concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene; her final choice to reply is earned by established curiosity with visible cost ("stepping into the map"). Embodied detail (onyx-ink stains, frayed cuff) and micro-choices under pressure anchor a credible stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost (the risk of being mapped); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as card patterns and messages build density. Orientation is immediate, and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (loft, skylight, workbench) is vivid and selective; the measuring tape as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through POV and integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: each card and message deepens mystery, tightening options. Cost is legible in the final beat as she commits to the map. One meaningful intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (mapping, measuring, cultural patterns) emerges from concrete particulars; the ending’s "By measuring what’s left" offers a resonant, non‑literal reweighting without moralizing. Subtext operates through card imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Lira’s analytical perception. POV is stable, with purposeful compression and rhythmic control under pressure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and serves momentum. Sentence‑level propulsion aligns with scene pressure, and the closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific—cartomancer reverse‑engineering cultural patterns—with organic synthesis of elements. Risk‑taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
