<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirien's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear, with embodied emotion ("hands trembled") and a credible micro-choice (taking the scrimshaw). The final renunciation of fighting her nature is earned by the preceding journey, though contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with clear on-page cost ("her body lighter...heart unlocked"). Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeking and release tightens through sensory density. Orientation is immediate; the scrimshaw's role is causal within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively pressures choice—the docks, sublittoral fringe, and coral temple all constrain navigation and charge the final image of return. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirien's perception ("air thick with salt and old grief").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom/connection) is signaled early and escalates through Lirien's agency under the Accumulative lens—following the map, opening the temple. The cost is legible in the scrimshaw's dissolution and her altered stance. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of freedom through non-seeking emerges organically from image and action, resisting moralizing. The final line ("Not to escape, but to belong") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the quest. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyric compression is taught and legible, with purposeful elision (the island's appearance). No head-hopping; voice modulates cleanly with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs ("The whale’s call came again, closer this time...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of nautical mysticism and a personal quest for detachment feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with specificity in the whalebone map and the mother's revelation transforming a familiar archetype through grounded, emotional detail.</comment>
