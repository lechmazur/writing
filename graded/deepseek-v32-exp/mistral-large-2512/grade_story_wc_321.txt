<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's ardent and resiliently positive nature is concretely embodied through his actions and interiority, driving the key choice to address the commuters. His motivation—staying for moments when "the world's seams split open"—is clear and consistent, though lacks contradictory impulses that would elevate to 9+. The final choice is earned by prior causality and his established belief in light through cracks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: radio warning → ferry vanishing → Elias's intervention → resolution. Closure is a decisive change (commuters merge, ferry stabilizes) with felt cost in the merging of echoes. Orientation is immediate; the only minor limitation is that the cost, while legible, is not deeply visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (grotto arches, pulsed starlight) filters through Elias's perception and pressures choice—the hourglass and star patterns directly shape his tactic. The setting charges the final image, but the score is capped because Q2 is not ≥9.0, though the element passes its own 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ferry vanishing) is signaled early and tightens via the commuters' arrival. Elias's agency—using the hourglass and speaking to them—drives escalation under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the commuters' merging, but the trade-off lacks a sharply felt price, limiting the score to the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time as a tide and permanent transience emerges organically from images (hourglass, spectral commuters) and the final resonant image of the ferry sailing on. No moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. However, it does not reach the exceptional 9+ tier due to Q2's cap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, sea-shanty-inflected voice that modulates appropriately under pressure. Perception is character-specific (noticing patterns, hourglass hum). Dialogue is minimal but natural. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No scaffolding, loops, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. The score is capped because Q2 is not ≥9.0, though line-level craft is exemplary and closure remains untouched by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of a time-tide ferry is fresh and fully committed; details (empty hourglass, spectral grotto) are specific and organic. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A strong, publishable level of originality.</comment>
