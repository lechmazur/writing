<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s characterization is specific and embodied; his lifelong cataloging of the unremarkable motivates his experiment with the orris root. The final renunciation of an answer is earned by the shard's effect and the house's heavier resumption, with cost felt on the page. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing. The micro-choice to use the shard reveals his values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the realization that houses listen to themselves, and the shard grants "permission to stop." Cost is legible in the house's slower, heavier exhale. The structure of one continuous scene tightens cleanly to this revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, POV-filtered detail. The "quiet bay" and the leaning house are not just atmosphere; they are the crucible for the central stake. The orris root shard functions as a micro-setting that constrains the pivotal choice and charges the final image with its "shard of hush" effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification of pattern: the shard's insertion causes the house to "stop," which deepens into the revelation. The dominant stake (understanding the houses' aliveness) is tested and reweighted. Agency (using the shard) directly triggers the climax, and the cost is visible in the altered rhythm of the house's resumption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of silence and the cost of stillness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the house resuming "slower now, heavier," reweighting the quest for understanding without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the house leaning and the streetlights daydreaming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptional: a distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling," "streetlights daydreamed") that remains consistent and deeply filtered through Elias's noticing mind. POV is stable and confident. The lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is pristine, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences do multiple jobs ("The house *stopped*. Not all at once, but in increments..."). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The metaphorical extension of "a shard of hush" is precise and earned. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices: the haunted house trope becomes a meditation on self-listening and permission, anchored by the unique tool of a perfumer's orris root. The synthesis feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
