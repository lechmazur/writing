<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity is embodied through specific micro-choices (borrowing goggles, decoding the diary), and her final renunciation feels earned by the accumulated weight of the captain's grief. Internal conflict between intrusion and empathy is shown in scene, not summarized. The captain's restrained grief and status dynamics pressure Lira's choice, creating a credible arc with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost: Lira leaves the diary and goggles, and the captain's tender gesture reconfigures the secret's meaning. The accumulative lens holds as details (goggles, diary, sketches) deepen emotional stakes. Orientation is immediate; the elevator ascent frames the scene tightly. The diary's convenient appearance is a minor concession to the prompt but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and captain's quarters are vivid, sensory, and constrain choice—the cold bites, frosted windows enable the decoding method. Recurring objects (goggles, diary) charge the final image. Setting is filtered through Lira's curiosity and professional ascent, integrating seamlessly with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding versus respecting privacy—escalates through Lira's agency: she deciphers the diary, then chooses to leave it. The captain's confrontation tightens options, and the renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening revelation reweights the stakes without need for multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the encrypted diary, scattered light, and the final image of the spire. The idea that "some secrets are not hers to unfold" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the captain tracing sketches) and silence, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of grief and boundaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Lira's inquisitive perception. Voice is distinct, lyrical yet restrained, with rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext ("Some things aren’t meant to be unfolded"). No head-hopping; elision (the diary's origin) is purposeful and paid off in revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character and atmosphere; the final paragraph's image of "white and gold" haze resonates. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and line-level craft supports the accumulative drive without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of icebound spire, airship lore, and encrypted grief feels organic and specific. Tropes (the curious servant, the grieving captain) are transformed through grounded detail and emotional honesty. The synthesis is fresh, though not groundbreaking; risk-taking is moderate but coherent, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
