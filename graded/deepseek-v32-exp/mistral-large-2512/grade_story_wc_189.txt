<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora’s warmly observant nature is embodied in specific, concrete actions (tracing water, studying the cicada), and her internal conflict between escape and duty is legible. The final choice to return is earned by the cicada’s vanishing and her realization, with the cost implied in the unresolved silence she must face. No contradictory impulses are dramatized simultaneously in scene, keeping it just below the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory and emotional details accumulate to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) where the cicada becomes a key to the conversational silence. Closure lands on-page with felt conceptual cost (the waiting pause). Causality is clean, but the cost is more implied than visceral, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pool are vividly rendered through selective sensory detail and function as a micro-setting that constrains choice (isolation enables experiment) and charges the final image (the changed grotto, watching stars). However, per the global 9+ gate (Q2 <9.0), the score is capped at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting the decision about leaving) escalates via accumulative density—the cicada’s mystery intensifies through study, dream, and sinking, culminating in Liora’s agency-driven realization. Cost is legible in the return to the waiting conversation, though the external conflict remains off-page, slightly limiting visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (transition, time, silence) emerges organically through concrete particulars—the cicada, the pause, the tidal pool—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct lyrical, observant voice that matches Liora’s perception. Rhythm and diction are controlled, and there is no head-hopping or experimental clutter. The perceptual signature is strong. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with vivid imagery and varied sentence rhythm. High information density; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No scaffold, loops, or artifacts that obscure closure. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 <9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada as a key to silence, texture of time—feels organic and specific, offering a fresh angle on internal transition. Emotional truth is grounded in character particulars, though the risk-taking is moderate, not groundbreaking.</comment>
