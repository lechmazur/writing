<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and his internal shift from deciphering to releasing is earned. However, interiority leans abstract ("terrestrially cosmic") and emotions are more told than embodied, limiting visceral connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: the prophecy is released and the summoner finds peace. The accumulative lens holds, and cost is visible in the dissolution of the wing. Structure is tight, but causality is simple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral to the action; the brook and nocturnal haven charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, creating a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and escalate through the summoner's decision to release the wing. Agency is clear and cost is legible, though the conflict is quiet and lacks dynamic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence and release emerges organically from imagery and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is effectively woven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent throughout, with a controlled third-person limited POV. The perceptual signature of mapping silence reinforces character and theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmically varied, but occasional abstract compounds ("terrestrially cosmic") risk overwriting. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, though density may challenge clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The quiet, introspective take on a summoner releasing a prophecy is original and specific. The synthesis feels inevitable, and the story commits fully to its lyrical risk.</comment>
