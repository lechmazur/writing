<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (pretending not to care vs. longing for acknowledgment) is embodied in micro-choices like polishing marbles and clipping the rose. His final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the withered garden and his aged hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias accepts he can only tend, not control. Cost is legible in the seedling's fragility and the scattered marbles. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden maze is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (narrowing paths, rising roots) and charges the final image (seedling in dry fountain). Sensory details are filtered through Elias's expertise and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden's trust) escalates via Elias's agency (placing marbles, following map) under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the foreclosed option of control and the quiet victory of tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (mending deception, control vs. tending) emerges through particulars (marbles, rose, seedling). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, aged, attentive to the garden's whispers). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "time after luck became measurable") is taught and pays off in tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("petals the color of dried blood") is precise and pressure-appropriate. Sentence variety supports momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism and gardener trope through specific, grounded choices (cracked marbles, metallic seedling). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
