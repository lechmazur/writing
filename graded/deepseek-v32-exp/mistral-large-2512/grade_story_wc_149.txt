<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's embodied conflict and motivated choice to accept memory are earned with visible cost; interiority is concrete and contradictory, e.g., "mournful elation" and trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise); accumulative lens holds; cost legible in "the wound remained—lovingly venomous, forever open"; orientation clear within first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and constrains choice via the bead and greenhouse; micro-setting charges final image with atmospheric pressure, e.g., "bead grew warmer" influencing Liora's realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora's agency with the bead; cost unmistakable in the enduring wound; one meaningful tightening under accumulative lens via density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of debt and memory emerges through image and implication; final offer of non-literal resolution without moralizing, e.g., bead pressed to lips tasting "salt and old magic."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct lyrical voice; rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "time moved differently—slower, thicker"; no head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language consistent and purposeful, though risk of overwriting avoided by pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly debt and alchemical setting; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation of tropes through specific detail.</comment>
