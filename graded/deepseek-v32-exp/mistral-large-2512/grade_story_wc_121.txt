<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction (fractured self) is concrete, and his final renunciation is earned by the confrontation with the older self. The choice to let go of the door carries visible cost (the tablet gone, runes faded). Minor diagnostic label-speak ("He knew then what he had to do.") is anchored in action, so no major deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with clear cost on the page: the tablet is gone, and Elias feels whole. The hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds from the accidental float through the labyrinth to the return. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct and clay tablet function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet stones, ozone smell). The environment subtly mirrors internal states (viaduct as mirror) without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquering the labyrinth of self) escalates through Elias's agency: pressing the tablet, facing the older self, and ultimately letting go. The cost is legible in the faded runes and his quiet wholeness. One meaningful tightening (the confrontation) suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "The labyrinth was still there, but so was the way out." No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. The voice modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., the labyrinth's unfolding). Dialogue (one line from the older self) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("like a map drawn by a mad cartographer") is consistent and purposeful. Closure image is clear and uncluttered by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of familiar elements (alternate selves, magical realism) feels fresh and organic due to specific setting (viaduct, tablet) and a non-obvious resolution (renunciation over conquest). Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
