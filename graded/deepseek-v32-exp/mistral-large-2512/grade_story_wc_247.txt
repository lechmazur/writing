<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s characterization is concrete and interior; contradictory impulses (“joyful sorrow”) act in scene, and her final endurance (“Keep going”) is earned by prior causality. Elias is a coherent secondary pressure. The “quietly charismatic” trait is told more than shown through costly choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly. Closure is a Charged Poise (“she felt seen”) that reconfigures the silence/stakes with felt cost on the page (“For the first time in a long time, Lena didn’t feel forgotten.”). Orientation is immediate, pattern taught, and one meaningful deepening (from mapping to composing) suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV (“the way the water held the reflections of things unseen”) and functions as micro-setting: the harbor and the camera constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action and emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens through a single meaningful cadence shift—Lena moves from framing emptiness to actively “pulling sound from the very fabric of the night.” The dominant stake (translating silence) is signaled early and reweighted with cost (“her heart full”). Agency is attentional, foreclosing the path of passive grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence, memory, transformation) emerges organically from image and action; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (e.g., signing as “speaking without breaking the silence”). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third with a distinct perceptual signature (“mapping silence,” “joyful sorrow”). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation. Purposeful elision (the mother’s death) is anchored in the present and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a slight template cadence with “the way…” constructions (“the way the light danced, the way the silence hummed”). This does not obscure closure or causality, but prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core synthesis—translating silence into music via sign language and a filmless camera—is fresh, specific, and fully committed. Emotional truth and character complexity elevate a familiar “artist’s epiphany” frame. The risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
