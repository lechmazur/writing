<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("precisely playful"), with embodied emotion under pressure; his final choice to step into the storm with the key is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (key in palm, storm raging) under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the decaying directive persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet earth, ozone) are selective and purposeful; the wafer seal as a recurring object constrains choice and charges the final image by reforming into a key.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths choose walkers) escalates through Elias's agency; cost is legible when he steps into the storm after gaining understanding, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of choice vs. destiny emerges through events and subtext (e.g., "the path is alive"); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the key symbolizing transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; dialogue with the woman is natural and goal-driven, and lyrical voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like the ribs of some great, slumbering beast") is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of decaying directive and path mythology feels inevitable; risk-taking with dream sequences and surreal elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
