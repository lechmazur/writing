<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s reflective nature and professional history anchor his curiosity, and his micro-choices (going to the bay, entering the atrium, throwing the stone) are consistent under pressure. However, the final understanding is stated directly ("Elias understood then...") rather than fully embodied in a moment of contradictory impulses, which slightly softens the earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dream leads to bay visit, stone-throwing, atrium draw, and instructed action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the reweighted perception of light and his purpose. Minor coincidence in the old woman’s timely arrival is offset by the legible before/after shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism atrium is the central environmental constraint, filtering dawn light and housing the pool that delivers the climactic vision. Sensory details (salt, old paper, mist) are selective and POV-filtered, and the setting actively pressures choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal search for meaning) escalates through Elias’s agency: drawn by dream, then the old woman’s instruction forces a decisive act. The final vision deepens the stake and reweights options with a visible cost—the burden of seeing what was always there.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (perception, value in the mundane) emerges through concrete images (glass, ripples, light) and avoids final-paragraph moralizing. The old woman’s line "we must find the value in the mundane" is slightly explicit, but the ending answers with a resonant, non-literal image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias’s glazier perspective. Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent under pressure ("each pane a tiny prison for the light"). No head-hopping; dialogue is spare and natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied rhythm, and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("skeletal cathedral," "spectral shards") is coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image is clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a glazier’s perspective with mystical elements (noctilucent reckonings, prism atrium). The occupation and central object are irreplaceable, transforming a familiar search-for-meaning arc into a specific, inevitable-feeling whole.</comment>
