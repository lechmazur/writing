<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion, though "calmly intuitive" recurs as a near-label. Elias's motivation to "map empathy onto action" is dramatized through his urgent response to the child's warning. His final choice is earned by prior setup of his trust in courage. Minor deduction for the slightly repetitive trait phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal lens: the seer's warning drives Elias to the orchard, the mirrors reveal the threat, leading to the village confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost legible in "the weight in his chest lifted" and the settling ice. Orientation is immediate; the taught pattern of the mirrors pays off cleanly at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and actively pressures choices: the ice floes carry the threat, the lighthouse beam cuts the dark, the orchard forms a path. The recurring object (crystal fragment) charges the final image by shattering to defeat the beast. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village safety) is signaled early via the child's reflection. Escalation is coherent under the causal lens: each mirror glimpse raises urgency, narrowing options to a final confrontation. Cost is visible in the creature's dissolution and Elias's exhausted relief. Agency drives the escalation, though the final solution relies slightly on intuitive action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reconstituting light from broken promises emerges organically through the crystal and the lighthouse beam. Subtext operates in images like "shattered promise" and the final child's smile. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight deduction for the near-thematic echo in "You reconstituted the light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and close third, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, shadow-laced descriptions. Voice modulates effectively with pressure, compressing during the run. The elision of how the crystal works is taught and paid off by trusting intuition. No head-hopping; dialogue (though minimal) is functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally propulsive, but shows minor artifacts: "calmly intuitive" repeats; some figurative language is dense ("like skeletal fingers," "like a shattered promise"). A paraphrase loop occurs with "intuition, calmly intuitive." Rhythm remains strong, and closure clarity is unaffected. Deduction for these line-level scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse, orchard, ice floes, and prophetic mirrors feels fresh and organic. The "shadow-laced peacekeeper" trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The core concept of reconstituting light through sacrifice provides a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
