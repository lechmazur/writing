<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied; his shift from janitor to witness is earned through specific micro-choices (grabbing the glass, tracing the star). However, contradictory impulses do not act simultaneously in scene, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("He felt like a witness"). The accumulative lens holds; the yellow lantern glass and forgotten station persistently shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station and lantern glass are vividly specific and charge the final image. The object-as-setting constrains choice (tracing the star) and reweights the ending, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, the star's fall triggers a decisive intensification; Elias's agency in tracing it reweights the stake of meaning. Cost is legible in his trembling and ache, though escalation remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the glass humming recharges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently elegant and perceptually specific to Elias's POV. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the emotional beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor and the quiet, mythic tone feel fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in stillness pays off with a specific synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
