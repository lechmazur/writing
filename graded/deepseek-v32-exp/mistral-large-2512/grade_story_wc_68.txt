<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear motivation and internal conflict; his decision to surface is earned and carries cost, though the change is more stance than action, and contradictory impulses are summarized rather than simultaneously acted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal chain leads to a charged poise closure; orientation is immediate, lens holds, and cost is legible in the final step. The resonant reconfiguration (Elias's decision to step into the unknown) lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is richly atmospheric and functionally pressures choice; the cog as micro-setting constrains action and charges the final image with tangible, sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. forgetting) escalates through Elias's agency; his decision to engage carries visible cost, though the escalation is a single tightening without a major reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the conceptual repricing of the past is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable POV with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and diction reflect character's mind, though no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense, evocative prose with no scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion and clarity support closure, and figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific character and object; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the combination feels organic.</comment>
