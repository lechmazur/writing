<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is embodied and consistent; her shift from grief to harmonizing is earned through concrete micro-choices. The healing thought is slightly diagnostic but remains in character for a poet, with no major flaws touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the enduring grief and transformed feather. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent image of the feather shapes the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon and drake's feather are vividly sensory and actively constrain Mira's choices, charging the final image where the feather becomes a quill, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional healing escalates through density of imagery; Mira's agency in wading and writing forecloses pure grief with visible cost in the enduring sorrow, clear under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically, but the final paragraph's explicit statement "broken things could sing" slightly moralizes, incurring a thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature; the poet's voice modulates naturally with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language is pattern-taught and serves propulsion; no loops or scaffold artifacts, and rhythm supports the accumulative design without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, natural imagery, and poetic creation feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet lyricism pays off with coherence, though the core premise is familiar but transformed.</comment>
