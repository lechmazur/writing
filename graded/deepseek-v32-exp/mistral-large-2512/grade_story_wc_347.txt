<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's reluctant caretaker role is embodied with concrete guilt and contradictory impulses; her final choice to guide via nuts is earned by prior causality, though some interiority is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from nut/blueprint discovery to guided escape is tight; closure lands with Earned Stasis (curse holds) and visible cost (continued bondage, guilt) under a sustained causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting—orchard, labyrinth, mechanical birds—constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and woven through action, creating palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under a causal lens; the traveler’s scream triggers immediate pressure, and her nut-scattering plan narrows options with a legible cost (enduring curse).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty, guilt, and cyclical sacrifice emerges organically from images and events; the final reconfiguration (fruit never eaten) offers resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira’s perceptual signature; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with vivid figurative language, varied syntax, and zero loops or artifacts; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and map-like nuts feels fresh and inevitable; the graceless beauty tone and method of guiding without touching heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
