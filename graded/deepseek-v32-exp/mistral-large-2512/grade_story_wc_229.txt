<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's quiet determination and Maren's skepticism create credible pressure. Interiority is concrete through sensory vibrations, and the final experiment is earned by prior causality. Minor lack of internal contradiction, but micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation clear early. Accumulative lens builds through sensory details to a charged poise closure where the whisper's echo validates Elias's belief with felt cost. Lens holds without contradiction; persistent constraint of storm and vial shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices; the lighthouse and storm constrain tactics, and the vial cork charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving whispers vs. shouts escalates through the storm's intensity and Elias's agency in dropping the vial. Cost is legible in the shattered vial and the resonant echo, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between subtlety and loudness, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and filtered through Elias's perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and rhythmic, with dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or distance issues; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrational concepts in a lighthouse setting, with specific details that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation test passed.</comment>
