<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in failure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that earn his final shift from sealing to weaving. Interiority is concrete, though contradictory impulses could be more pronounced in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure lands with a decisive change (tear stitched) and resonant reconfiguration (weaving vs. sealing), cost legible in the released breath. The flute as constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; the flute and canyon silence constrain choice and charge the final image. The other side is slightly less specific but functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend the tear) escalates through Elias's agency; one meaningful tightening leads to the weaving choice, with cost felt in the tension release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of weaving vs. sealing emerges naturally, though the figure's statement is direct; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of stitched silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and voice modulates effectively with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished prose with high density, varied syntax, and no loops or muddle; figurative language serves atmosphere and closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of portal fantasy with weaving metaphor; specific details (flute, driftwood) and emotional truth make the turn feel inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
