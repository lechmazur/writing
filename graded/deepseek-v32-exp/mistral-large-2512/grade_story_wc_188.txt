<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her vocation, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (steady fingers, tremor in chest). However, interior contradiction is minimal; the arc from defiance to remembrance is realized cleanly but lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the final image ("the light had given her something in return") reweights the quest from defiance to remembrance with undeniable cost (spent rag, revealed figures). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly via pattern (light/dark, chanting).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through POV (damp earth, old smoke, brittle wicks). The fortress as a "blooming" micro-setting actively constrains choice and decisively charges the final image of the glowing lantern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency—lighting the torches—which deepens the stake from bringing light to remembering. The cost is legible on the page (rag spent, figures revealed). Under the accumulative lens, the density increase reweights the dominant stake meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges seamlessly from action and image (light/memory, defiance/remembrance). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final realization, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in the shifting silence of the revealed figures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, professional bias). Voice modulates with pressure ("the fortress gasped") without head-hopping. The elision of the note's origin is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's breath ("She struck a match. The flame caught, greedy and bright").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ideas (fireworks designer, mosaic note, memory-as-light). The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in voice and setting. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
