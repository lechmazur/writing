<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in his role and the world's silence, intensifying to compel his experiment with dust. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "his breath caught" and "his voice rough but steady." The final choice—making dust speak—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the brittle laugh and indifferent mist. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the arc is coherent and cost-legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: dust speaks, reconfiguring silence with felt cost. Causal lens holds tightly from broadcast to dust, with persistent constraints (famine, dust) shaping tactics. Orientation is anchored early (<120 words). Cost is legible in "the sound brittle but real" and the mist's indifference, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-bearing: the ember alcove's hidden warmth and the ubiquitous dust constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (damp ash, old parchment, liquid gold glow) are selective and POV-filtered. The alcove and dust function as micro-settings that directly enable the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring stories) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from hearing lyrics to interpreting and acting. A meaningful tightening occurs when the song swells and he understands dust's nature. Cost is legible in his effort and the world's silence, with closure foreclosing the path of inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: loss, remnants, and renewal through dust. Subtext operates in lyrics and dust's luminescence, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—dust speaking—that reweights prior material without statement. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (copyist's attention to ink, parchment, frequency). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (song fragments) is taught and pays off. Rhythm supports emotional beats, e.g., short sentences at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with figurative language ("glow curled like a sleeping cat") serving atmosphere and advance. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (e.g., dust "swirled like a tiny storm" while advancing plot). Closure image is clear and unmarred by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in specific synthesis: story famine, pirate broadcast, and dust as story remnants feel organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices (copyist, elusive lyrics). Risk-taking in quiet, luminous tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image recharges prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
