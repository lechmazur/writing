<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her archivist identity, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The final choice to chase shadows is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are present but not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise as Elara decides to walk the fog bridge backward, a decisive change with felt cost. The hybrid drive lens (causal/accumulative) holds, and orientation is anchored early without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory and forecourt are vividly specific, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with character perception and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake in salvaging identity escalates through each monument examination, driven by Elara's agency. The final tightening—her decision to walk the bridge—carries unmistakable cost under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and identity emerges through concrete images and subtext, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (e.g., elision of dialogue) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats; closure image is clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of preemptive nostalgia, shadow examination, and fog bridge feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept is fully committed.</comment>
