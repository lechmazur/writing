<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., hesitation at the split, trembling fingers). However, interior contradiction is slight, and the final choice, while earned, lacks deep conflicting impulses. The profession as illustrator informs perspective but does not crucially constrain on-page tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change (“uncaged the moment”) with cost felt through the looming Giant’s Nap. Causal lens holds tightly: each beat follows from prior choices. Orientation is immediate. Slight deduction because the cost is implied rather than unmistakably legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (canal split forces a decision); the hourglass as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, with spatial choreography clear. No orientation or consistency issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncaging time) escalates through Liora’s agency under causal lens: following cadence, choosing spiral, turning hourglass. Cost is implied by the Giant’s Nap threat, but not viscerally paid on-page, limiting the score. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of time and echoes emerges organically through image and action, with a resonant, non-literal ending (“world dissolved into light”). Subtext operates in whispers and the pendant’s warmth. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical-perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure. Whispers function as goal-driven dialogue. No head-hopping. Score capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though quick test is satisfied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“searing against her collarbone”) but no clarity loss. Satisfies 9+ quick test, but capped by Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-borrowing, echoes, and illustrator’s quest feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Score capped due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, though transformation and specificity are high.</comment>
