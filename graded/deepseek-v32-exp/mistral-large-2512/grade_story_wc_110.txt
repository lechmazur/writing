<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (Mira's guardedness vs. desire for connection) act in scene; final choice to be honest is earned by prior causality with visible cost of years of mistrust. Characterization is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence becomes a beginning, with felt cost of past pretense. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of mistrust shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (slick cobblestones, scent of celluloid) filtered through POV. The lens object constrains choice and charges the final image; forecourt bookends with tonal resonance, though its "whispering" is slightly decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust escalates via protagonist agency in confrontation and revelation. Cost is legible in shaky breath, quickened pulse, and admission of fear. One meaningful tightening forecloses the option of continued pretense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and connection emerges through particulars; subtext operates in gesture and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (silence as beginning) without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (Mira's observant, detail-oriented voice). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied syntax and high information density. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm supports tension and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (lonely cinema workers) through specific, grounded choices. Ticket-stub eavesdropping is a non-obvious inflection; risk-taking in quiet tension heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
