<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure (stiffening at inspection, forced smile) reveal credible motivation; Quill's charm is consistent but his interiority is limited. Final decision to join rebellion earned through prior involvement and cost implied, though not deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with tight because/therefore linkages; closure is a Charged Poise where rebellion begins, cost legible in the inspector's threat and final image of defiance. Orientation clear within first paragraph, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the finale; sensory details (humming cicadas, fogged spectacles) are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's expertise. Spatial choreography clean during inspector's entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiance against thought tax) signaled early; escalation via inspector's arrival tightens pressure, forcing Elias's active decision to join. Cost is implied rather than visceral, but agency under causal lens drives meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of subtle resistance emerges through concrete particulars (gourd seed, warped patterns) without moralizing; ending image of gourd rattling for the defiant offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable through Elias; voice has distinct perceptual signature (lyrical but controlled, e.g., "living metronome"). Dialogue natural and goal-driven, with subtext in lines like "thoughts are taxable."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is economical and vivid with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "The greenhouse hummed around them, alive with possibility."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought taxation, secret plant language, and rogue scholar tropes; specificity in details like gourd rattle seed and entomologist's greenhouse makes premise feel inevitable and risky without obscuring clarity.</comment>
