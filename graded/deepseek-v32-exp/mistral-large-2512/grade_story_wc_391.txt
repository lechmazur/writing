<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his patience earned through mapping, and final choice to join the stranger is motivated by prior causality with visible cost in the quiet revolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, closure lands with Charged Poise; viaduct's hum and stranger's appearance reconfigure stakes with felt cost in the final image of the rising revolution, lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (ice's give, viaduct's pulse) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere with indispensable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via Elias's vigilance; escalation via accumulative density (viaduct's hum, stranger) leads to tightening where agency and cost are legible in the quiet joining, under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, through image and implication that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical voice maintains consistency under pressure, and purposeful elision (stranger's identity) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports accumulative texture without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of horizon mapper, magnetic viaduct, and patient revolution feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in quiet atmospheric approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
