<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation earned with visible cost (discarding cloak, tearing photo). Contradictory impulses shown in mirror confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tight; closure is a decisive change with legible cost (cloak discarded, photo torn, weight lifted). Orientation clear early; persistent constraint of fear shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse setting constrains choice and charges final image; sensory details (rust, caramelized sugar) are selective and purposeful; mirrors act as essential arena.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency; cost unmistakable in discarded objects and lighter chest; stake tightens from fear to triumph through active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and paradox; slight thematic echo in final advisor line ("You made it see itself") reduces score, but resonance remains strong and non‑literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third‑person limited POV; voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled under pressure; no head‑hopping; perceptual signature sharp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifact loops; figurative language serves clarity and pressure; no scaffold or paraphrase loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychological horror and self‑confrontation; risk‑taking with abstract advisor and paradoxical notes pays off; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
