<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character is consistent and her renunciation (letting the book dissolve) is earned by prior causality, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; interiority is concrete and embodied, yet the cost of her stasis is subtle rather than vividly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost in her fleeting self-question and return to silence; orientation is early and clear, and the pattern of silence/regeneration pays off at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integrated; the obsidian refuge and library constrain choice (the book is dissolved at the river) and charge the final image with tangible atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, the appearance of the new book deepens the dominant stake (witnessing vs. involvement); her agency in dissolving it forecloses an option with a felt, though quiet, cost—escalation is a single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges through concrete images (swan, river, book) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via her momentary wonder and return, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct—lyrical, meditative, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through the keeper’s focus on silence and folding; rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and consistent, with no loops or scaffold; sentence‑level rhythm varies naturally and heightens the closure beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of a keeper of absence is fresh and fully committed; the synthesis of silence, folding, and witnessing feels organic and inevitable, with risk‑taking in the quiet, accumulative structure that heightens stakes.</comment>
