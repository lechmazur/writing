<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's aesthetic drive and "tremor of certainty" are embodied through concrete micro-choices (tracing quartz, kneeling, vocal writing). The final transformation—from poet to one who "walked through the poem"—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "limbs heavy with the weight." No diagnostic labels; interiority is specific and sensory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguring poet and poem. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The crack in ice and answering hum escalate density; cost is legible in heavy limbs and softened light. All beats cohere toward resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid, sensory, and filtered through poet's perception. The quartz colonnade and frozen lake are active, not static: they pulse, crack, melt, and directly charge the final image. Environment constrains choice (she interacts with quartz) and shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (artistic/personal transformation) and escalate through sensory accumulation. Protagonist agency drives each beat—tracing, kneeling, writing—culminating in boundary dissolution. Cost is felt in bodily weight and the melting ice's reconfiguration of possibilities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving boundaries between artist and art emerges through image and action, never stated. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the poet becoming "someone who had walked through the poem." No moralizing; subtext is woven into the lyric texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct poetic perceptual signature. Voice is consistently lyrical, syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., short sentence for ice crack). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., elders' warning) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and controlled with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence variety supports rhythmic propulsion; even the cliché "like a lover’s breath" is a minor slip that doesn't touch closure. All lines advance story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of poet, forbidden atrium, and boundary dissolution feels inevitable. The lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity (quartz colonnade, tremor of certainty) is integral, not ornamental; transformation is earned.</comment>
