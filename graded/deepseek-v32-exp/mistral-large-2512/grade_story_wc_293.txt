<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Charged Poise under an accumulative lens; orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the final image of "luminous disbelief" and the retained glass flake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in small things emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, anchored in the glass flake and music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively lyrical and perceptually specific to Lena; POV is stable and controls distance effectively, with rhythm modulating under pressure.</comment>
