<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is rooted in concrete backstory (the shard as relic of a failed revolution) and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final ritual. Interiority is specific and embodied ("burnished sorrow in his chest aching like an old wound"). His final choice—using the shard and mirrors—is a credible renunciation/endurance that forecloses the path of compromise with visible cost (he is slumped, breath shallow). Dr. Vex applies immediate secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's ritual reconfigures the asteroid's meaning and leaves him in a state of exhausted hope, with cost legible in his physical state and the blank mirrors. Causal lens holds: his actions stem from established motive and conflict. Orientation is immediate and clear. The mechanism of the mirror ritual is somewhat mystical but taught early (mirrors trap the unwary) and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and critically constrains choice: the temporal storm outside raises urgency, the mirrors must be covered, and the archive's chamber becomes the stage for the climax. The asteroid's "baroque spires" and the "weight of time made visible" are filtered through Elias's poetic sensibility. The shard itself functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poetic meaning vs. cold data) is signaled early and escalates through the debate with Liora, culminating in Elias's high-stakes ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. Cost is visible on the page: Elias's physical depletion and the spent storm. The closure forecloses the option of passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty/data, memory/erasure) emerges organically from the conflict and the concrete particulars of the shard, mirrors, and storm. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I gave them back their voice"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the covered mirrors and the fractured light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, sorrowful, attentive to light and fracture). Voice is lyrical but controlled, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Liora's sharpness vs. Elias's weary conviction). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A few phrases verge on ornate ("grand hall of the Obsidian Archive") but remain consistent with the voice. No distracting loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion supports the climactic ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological dispute, temporal distortion, and poetic resistance feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through lived detail (the shard) and a non-obvious moral calculus (reimagination vs. solving). Risk-taking in the mystical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
