<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his identity as a blind artisan; his micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or visible struggle, which limits emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly; closure is a decisive change (drone returns with clear feedback) with cost legible in the tension of the launch. The persistent constraint of blindness shapes tactics, but the plot's simplicity prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the water feature constrains choice and charges the final image. The mist and depot cohere into a magnetic atmosphere, but the setting does not apply relentless pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode feedback) tightens with the ship's departure, driving agency. Escalation is clear under the causal lens, but the cost is mild—success without tangible loss—limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action and image, but the final line articulates the thesis a bit overtly, incurring a slight penalty. The resonant reconfiguration of perception is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elias's non-visual senses, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slightly ornate in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, drone repair, and water refraction feels fresh and organic. Specificity of detail and perspective elevate a simple plot, but the concept is not groundbreaking.</comment>
