<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (letting the past rest) is earned by prior causality, though some backstory is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with felt cost: the photographs restored, fragment gone, and Elara aged. Causal lens holds tightly from fragment discovery to climax, with no orientation debt. The willow doorway transition is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the living garden guides choices, constrains movement, and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's expertise, weaving atmosphere into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring lost loved ones) escalates through Elara's agency: using the fragment, entering the past, intervening. Cost is unmistakable in the final paragraph’s aging and loss of the fragment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, time, and irreversible cost emerges organically from images and actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"she let the past rest"—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and aligned with Elara's perception. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm modulate effectively with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The final image is sharp, and every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and fully committed: a living garden, a time-trapped fragment, and personal loss are synthesized into an inevitable, emotionally specific arc. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
