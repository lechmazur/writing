<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's interior conflict and micro-choices under pressure are vivid, but the shift from duty to freedom relies slightly on a told realization ("The gap between knowing...") rather than fully dramatized contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain tight; closure lands with decisive change and felt cost (jarring landing, bleak new world); persistent constraint of the statues shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details; the orchard and mechanical world pressure choices, and the locust shell as a recurring object constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes clear from outset; escalation driven by Liora's agency (mimicking shell, running, leaping) with visible cost on the page (impact, harsh new world).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of seizing beauty emerges through action and image; final paragraph's explicit statement is slightly on-the-nose but earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, close third-person POV with consistent voice and rhythmic prose; perceptual signature distinct; dialogue natural though minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose with varied syntax; no loops or figurative muddle; figurative language purposeful and supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and dystopian elements; specific details (locust shell, heart rhythms) create a singular, inevitable vision with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
