<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; his final decision to help initiate the fund is earned by prior causality, though interior contradictions are mild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost legible in the initiated cycle, and the misdelivered photo persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
