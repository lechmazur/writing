<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (destitute philanthropist) and micro-choices under pressure are concretely embodied; his final transformation to feeling "necessary" is earned by the prophecy's cost (lightning bug darkening) and prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change (destitute to necessary) with on-page cost (jar goes dark); causal lens holds tightly from detour to eruption; orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (volcano, black sand) actively pressures choice; the recurring lightning bug object charges the final image by going dark, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the village) escalates through prophecy and eruption; agency is in Elias's responsive run, with cost legible in the jar's darkening and his transformed stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through concrete images (lightning bug, volcano) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias becoming "necessary."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is lyrical yet controlled, with perceptual signature filtering setting through Elias's weary, purposeful consciousness; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the eruption, clarity untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of destitute philanthropist, prophecy, and quiet rebellion feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity or causality.</comment>
