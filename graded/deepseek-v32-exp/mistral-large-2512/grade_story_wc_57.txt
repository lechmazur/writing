<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, and interiority is concrete. However, there is no on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses, and the final charged poise does not involve a decisive change or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds, but the cost is more implied than unmistakably felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, creating a strong atmosphere. The rope and fulgurite glass charge the final image, but the setting does not actively constrain choices or tactics, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods) is signaled early and escalates through decoding reveals. However, escalation is driven more by discovery than protagonist agency under pressure, and the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and actions, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The charged poise reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific texture. No head-hopping or clarity issues, but the high-band gate is not met due to Q2 and Q4 scores.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor cap applied due to high-band eligibility conditions not fully met.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesis feels inevitable, with a memorable perspective. The story avoids cliché and takes lyrical risks, but the high-band gate is not met due to Q2 and Q4 scores.</comment>
