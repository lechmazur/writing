<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concretely embodied ("brittle, as if the weight of a thousand lives had settled into her bones overnight") and her micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the sundial, kneeling to the hum, reaching for the book) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The final choice to carry the past forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the years of isolation translated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lira achieves coexistence with the past, cost legible in "her heart lighter than it had been in years." The sundial and stone circle serve as persistent constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the tidal library's shifting shelves and the hum of the stone circle actively pressure Lira's choices and charge the closure. The sundial, as a micro-setting object, constrains action (guiding her to books) and is atomically integrated into the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density increase (the hum swells, the library responds) driven by Lira's agency in using the sundial and reading the book. The cost of her long isolation is unmistakably paid in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (sundial, memory, vibration) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer. A slight deduct for the final sentence's near-explicit moralizing, though it remains earned by prior texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("atomically reflective," "brittle" awakening). Voice modulates poetically under pressure without head-hopping; purposeful elision (the curator's warning) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor overwriting risk ("atomically reflective") is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure. Information density is high, each sentence advancing character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar themes (memory, isolation) through highly specific, irreplaceable elements (tidal library, sundial as tool, reincarnation memory). The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in setting that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
