<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is deep with embodied emotions and distinct voice; the mechanical arm and philosophical nature integrate seamlessly, driving motives. Elias's internal conflict and relationship with Isolde force choices that alter their dynamic by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot is tightly causal with clear orientation within 120 words; closure lands as a Charged Poise with emotional cost in Isolde's surrender and the brook's song. The causal lens holds, and the sundial and needle card shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like the atrium's hum and brook's murmur; the sundial and needle card act as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image with light patterns.</comment>
