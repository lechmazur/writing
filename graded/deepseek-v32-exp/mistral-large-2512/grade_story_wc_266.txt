<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her internal shift from passenger to active seeker is earned, though her characterization relies on summary past and lacks deep contradictory impulses in scene. Elias serves as a functional guide but his wisdom is more stated than enacted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Mira steps ashore and no longer feels like a passenger. The star stamp and indirect route shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric; the Veiled Ridgeway and ticket punch function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The cove with lanterns provides a concrete, transformative destination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage) escalates through Mira's realizations and the indirect journey; the tightening occurs when she steps onto the shore, foreclosing the safety of the ferry with visible cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (courage as traversal) emerges organically through image and action; subtext in the ticket punch and vigil avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perception; prose has a distinct lyrical rhythm, and dialogue is spare but natural. No head-hopping; voice supports the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; closure image is clear and propelled by precise sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ferryman archetype is refreshed through specific details (ticket punch, star stamp) and a focus on internal traversal; synthesis feels organic and inevitable, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
