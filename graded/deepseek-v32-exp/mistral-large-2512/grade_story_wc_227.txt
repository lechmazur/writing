<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's uncertainty and embodied emotions drive the narrative; his micro-choices under pressure, like tracing pockmarks, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final narration is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands with a decisive change as the statue splits with gold, memories flood back, and the workshop steadies, with cost legible in Elias's gasp and the transformed setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop and acid sea are vividly rendered, constraining choices through tilting gears and hissing fumes, and the statue as micro-setting charges the final image with liquid gold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stake of conjuring meaning escalates through Elias's agency in matching scars to pockmarks, leading to a map discovery and the climactic narration, with cost paid in emotional release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kintsugi emerges through scars, pockmarks, and gold repair without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the quilt of memories stitched with light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; the poetic, metallic voice reflects Elias's mindset and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops; figurative language like "acid sea licked at rusted struts" is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemist, acid sea, kintsugi, and memory statue feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
