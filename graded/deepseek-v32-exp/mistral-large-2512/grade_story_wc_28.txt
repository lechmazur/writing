<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's retrocognitive trap and renaming practice create a compelling interior contradiction, and her final choice to redefine "Amira" is earned by her established values. Micro-choices (pressing the tessera, the blood) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in emotional embodiment (e.g., "heart a quiet furnace").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: Liora’s decision to keep the name but redefine it reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (the sharp tessera drawing blood). The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with orientation anchored immediately. The final image reweights the premise of memory and mercy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plaza and shattered sky provide vivid atmosphere, but the mosaic tessera functions as micro-setting that decisively constrains choice and charges the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("charred cedar and damp stone"). The object's handling is integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (mercy vs. vengeance) are signaled early and escalate through the discovery of "Amira," forcing a single, meaningful tightening. Liora’s agency in the final choice is clear, and cost is legible on the page ("sharp enough to draw blood"). Effective under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from concrete action and image, not statement. The final redefinition of "Amira" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The "warm coldness" tone and mosaic reprise avoid moralizing, embracing complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature ("sky split like broken glass"). Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and maintained. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythmic control. One minor figurative muddle ("The warm coldness of the night") and a slightly familiar metaphor ("heart a quiet furnace") prevent a perfect score, but overall high information density and zero loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory, forgiveness, and reconstruction. The retrocognitive trait and mosaic object transform familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. Lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
