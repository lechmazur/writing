<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history; her final choice to sacrifice the perfume vial is earned by prior causality and embodies a visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though contradictory impulses are present but not deeply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: the diver dissolves, the temple sighs, and Lira understands the ephemeral. Cost is legible in the empty vial. Causal lens holds tightly from signal to resolution, with oxygen pressure shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the temple's hush muffles life support, and the oxygen gauge forces urgency. The perfume vial as a micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: oxygen depletion tightens options, the diver's message deepens stakes, and Lira's choice to offer the vial resolves with visible cost. Dominant stake (survival/rescue) is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and the ephemeral emerges through concrete particulars—the vial, the hush, the diver's dissolution—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: offering truth rather than harnessing force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that filters setting through Lira's urgency and loneliness. Voice modulates with pressure; elision (e.g., diver's unheard words) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("liquid starlight," "gathered hush") is consistent and heightens atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of underwater exploration, memory, and silence feels inevitable. The "gathered hush" concept and perfume vial are specific and irreplaceable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors freshness.</comment>
