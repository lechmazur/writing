<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lumen's contradictory impulses (denying poet identity yet carrying verse) are dramatized; his final shift from molting to rebuilding is earned by the key's promise and the library's call, with visible cost in relinquished vagrancy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from prison gift to library opening holds; closure is a decisive change (vagrant to rebuilder) with felt cost in the line "he didn’t feel like molting. He felt like rebuilding." Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as both environment and crucible, constraining choice (padlock requires key) and charging the final image of shelves waiting; sensory details (mildew, creaking metal) are filtered through Lumen's poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (joining the resistance through rebuilding) escalates via Lumen's agency—unlocking, sorting, handing Elias a book—and costs his old identity; the tightening is legible and irreversible under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (beauty sprouting from decay, words as resistance) emerges through particulars—the key, the tin, the sorted books—and resolves in a resonant, non-literal final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("shedding like a skin"); dialogue is spare but goal-driven, and voice modulation under pressure heightens the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and controlled figurative language; no loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak beats. The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates the resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vagrant poet, prison-library friendship, and linguistic resistance feels inevitable; the molting-personality trait transforms a familiar archetype through specific, cost-driven choices.</comment>
