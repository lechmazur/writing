<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Curator's interiority is concrete and embodied; her shift from bewildered inquiry to purposeful pursuit is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the orchard's shift, her brightened disquiet). Contradictory impulses—to ignore versus to inquire—act in scene, and her final choice to pursue rather than own knowledge is a credible renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (accumulative texture leading to causal turn) holds; closure is a decisive conceptual repricing with on-page cost ("the orchard ... shifted," bewilderment to awe). Orientation is immediate; the two-shard structure (gallery, bath, return) tightens cleanly, and the shell's persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the astral orchard and gallery pressure choices (the hum drives her to the bath) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV ("dim light like a whisper," water "shimmering with ... starlight"). The orchard itself becomes a micro-setting that reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding forbidden knowledge) escalates through protagonist agency—her deliberate inquiry in the bath triggers the realization that tightens options. Cost is legible in the orchard's shift and her acceptance of a path of "brightened disquiet." One meaningful deepening (shell as vessel) forecloses passive curation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge as lived inheritance) emerges from particulars (shell, ledger note, orchard's reverse ripening) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: "Some knowledge wasn’t meant to be recorded; it was meant to be lived." Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third‑person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, contemplative perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional pressure (from trembling fingers to bolt‑uight realization) without head‑hopping. No dialogue; elision (the orchard's shift) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a whisper of something forgotten") is purposeful and consistent. Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates with the climax; no artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astral orchard, pistachio‑shell artifact, and nonlinear inheritance feels organic and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk‑taking (lyrical abstraction, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
