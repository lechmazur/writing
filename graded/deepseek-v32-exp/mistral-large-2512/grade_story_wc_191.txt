<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in trait of being "wisely adventurous." Interiority is concrete through actions like adjusting goggles and hesitating before peeling bark. Final choice to sit on throne is earned by prior causality, though cost is implied rather than heavily dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; each beat follows from Veyra's choices. Closure lands on-page with decisive change: throne has an heir, and cost is felt in "weight settling on her shoulders." Orientation is immediate, no disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to plot: the kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard constrain Veyra's path and charge the final dawn image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of claiming the throne escalates through Veyra's agency—peeling bark, descending staircase—culminating in a choice with visible cost. Pressure tightens meaningfully under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and seeing beyond surface emerges through mural shifts and throne as test. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in image of civilizations rising and falling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm supports urgency without head-hopping. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "liquid stained glass" is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept of throne as test offers a fresh angle on quest narrative; specificity in details like ruby flake and peel of paint layers transforms tropes, though core premise is familiar.</comment>
