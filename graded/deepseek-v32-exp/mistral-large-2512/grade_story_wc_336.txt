<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is concrete and her motivation to preserve wonder is clear, but the absence of contradictory impulses or internal conflict limits depth. Her final act is earned by established traits, yet the lack of on-page struggle prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with a clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) and cost is legible in her trembling hands. Orientation is immediate, and the seed’s magic is taught early, but the escalation is gentle without a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly woven into action and charges the final image (waterfall's mist curls around the new tree). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though it does not tightly constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under an accumulative lens: planting and singing deepen stakes. Cost is felt in the weight of her act, but the absence of a live option foreclosed keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges through concrete images and the seed’s transformation, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though some explicit reflection (“the world was forgetting”) slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical with a consistent perceptual signature. The poetic syntax and rhythm are controlled, and there is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; the lyrical density is purposeful and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a seed as a bridge between worlds is fresh and executed with specific detail. Emotional truth and character-specific perspective elevate a familiar premise, though it does not feel groundbreaking.</comment>
