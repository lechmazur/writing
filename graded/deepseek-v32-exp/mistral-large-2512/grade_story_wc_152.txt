<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation (listening for unheard stories, uncovering truth) is clear and drives the plot; interiority is concrete though some emotions are labeled (e.g., "weight of what she had begun to notice"). Her final choice to act is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the city's tension and her personal risk. The single POV is consistent, and her micro-choices (disguise, spreading fragments) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight (discovery → pattern → action → impact); closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she watches the stars, the coup unraveling. The eternal candle as "silent witness" provides a felt cost. Orientation is immediate, and the inferred Causal lens holds without ambiguity through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (aged parchment, sweet smoke, golden leaves) anchor the setting with purpose. The cobalt observatory functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (isolation) and decisively charges the final image (window, stars, candle). Some city descriptions are slightly generic, but the overall atmosphere coheres and supports the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing the coup) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Liora's agency in discovering the synchronized errors and spreading the truth. A meaningful tightening occurs with the date revelation, forcing her into action. Cost is legible in the disguised risk and the city's tension, culminating in the final image where the conspiracy unravels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. conspiracy, the power of listening) emerges organically from particulars (star discrepancies, embroidered fragments). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the stars and candle, though the line "the quiet power of a story well told" borders on explicit moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct, lyrical voice suited to an observer/embroiderer. Perceptual signature is consistent (noticing patterns, threads, silence). Any elision (e.g., the message spreading) is purposeful and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Polished prose with controlled rhythm and high information density; sentences advance story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language ("thread by thread," "echoed silence") is apt and clear. Minor repetition ("unheard stories") does not harm momentum or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of galaxy-charting and political conspiracy through the specific lens of embroidery and "adjacent possibilities." The concept is fully committed to, transforming familiar tropes via lived detail. Risk-taking in a quiet, listening-driven resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
