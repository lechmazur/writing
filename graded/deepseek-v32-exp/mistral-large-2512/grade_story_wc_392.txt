<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from personal escape to active resistance. His occupational competence is balanced with genuine fear, and his final choice to fight back is rooted in established traits and values. However, interiority sometimes leans toward summary ("his stomach twisted") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the peak moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Closure is a Decisive Change (Elias commits to active opposition) with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the lantern's light shifts from historical guide to personal weapon). Causality is tight, and the final cost is legible in his deliberate, dangerous step forward. The climax's discovery and decision occur rapidly, feeling slightly compressed but not broken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is a vivid, pressure-inducing micro-setting that constrains movement and choices. The lantern functions as a key object, its properties (warmth, marks, flame) actively guiding Elias and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional and anxious perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates from personal freedom to preventing city-wide destruction. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, tightening as Elias's observation turns to confrontation and decisive action. The cost is legible in his trembling hands and the dangerous commitment of his final step. The turn is driven by his agency in investigating and choosing to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (legacy of resistance confronting systemic corruption) emerges organically through the lantern's reweighted meaning and Elias's shift from investigator to actor. Subtext operates in the contrast between Voss's hidden work and the lantern's historical purpose. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the guiding flame becoming a weapon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third, with a perceptive signature shaped by Elias's profession ("like a scalpel"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, blending observational precision with mounting urgency. The elision of the lock-picking skill is anchored in a prior case, paying off cleanly. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with effective rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slightly cliché metaphor ("cutting through the gloom like a scalpel") and a paraphrase loop near the climax ("This wasn't just about control—it was about destruction."). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the peak beat's texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a preventable death investigator with an Underground Railroad relic is fresh and specific, transforming a conspiracy thriller premise through grounded, lived-in detail. The core concept feels organic to character and conflict. The risk of blending historical legacy with modern systemic corruption pays off in a coherent, inevitable-feeling closure.</comment>
