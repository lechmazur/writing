<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lan's dual allegiance and orderly intuition are embodied in micro-choices under pressure; her final belief is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the burden she carries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost ("weight of dual allegiance still pressed on her chest"), and the persistent constraint of gentrification shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft carnival setting pressures choices via its imperiled nature; the foundation stone chip constrains Lan's focus and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lan's agency—sabotage, graffiti—under causal lens; cost is legible in the impending vote and her burden, tightening options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation emerges through concrete actions and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The raft survives because we choose it") that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm and selective filtering reflect Lan's mindset under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with crisp propulsion; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification within a floating carnival setting; risk-taking in world-building and character role feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
