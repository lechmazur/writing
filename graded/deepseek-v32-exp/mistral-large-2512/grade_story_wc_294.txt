<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The final choice to leave is earned by prior reflection, but backstory reliance slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; orientation is clear early. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the image of leaving and the spiral realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and selective, with the circus train constraining choice and charging the final image through details like the fox and rain, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding cyclical paths) escalates via accumulative reflection; Elias's agency in deciding to move forecloses stagnation with visible cost in the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, earned through concrete particulars like the foreign money and train.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and reflective, consistently filtered through Elias's consciousness, and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar themes through specific details (circus train, foreign money); risk-taking in quiet reflection pays off with inevitable hindsight cohesion.</comment>
