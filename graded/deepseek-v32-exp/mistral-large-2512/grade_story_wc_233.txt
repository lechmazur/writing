<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Queen's interiority and motivation are clear and embodied; micro-choices under pressure lead to an earned transformation. Mirror queen is more a device than a character, but that's acceptable in this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from dreams to climb to mirror encounter is tight; closure is a decisive change with cost (rebirth) that lands on the page, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting that constrains choice (treacherous climb) and charges the final image (grotto as cathedral of light).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (identity/destiny) escalate through queen's agency; cost of transformation is felt in the final image under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic integration emerges through image and action; final rebirth offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong and consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, poetic prose with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic and personal; transformation feels earned and specific to this character and world, with risk-taking in lyrical style.</comment>
