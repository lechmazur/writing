<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses (skepticism and belief) drive on-page micro-choices under pressure; her final decision to embrace the changeling is earned by prior causality, with the cost of responsibility legible in the final image. "Forgiving skeptic" is slightly told but immediately demonstrated through action and endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly from inciting incident to closure; orientation is immediate; closure is a Decisive Change (finding and accepting the changeling) with felt cost (taking on its care) and the teeth persistently constrain tactics, shaping the final map and reunion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and POV-filtered; the garden and teeth function as micro-settings that constrain choice (the maze path, the ritual site) and charge the final image (the map, the child's emergence). Specific details like "colors no one had names for" deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the changeling/set things right) escalates through Lena's agency: tooth discovery, ritual, map, confrontation. Each tightening narrows options; cost is visible in her commitment to the changeling and the town's unanswered questions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness, embracing strangeness) emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement; the final line—“some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Lena's perception. Diction and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity; dialogue (though brief) is natural and charged with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and pattern-taught; syntax varies to match emotional beats; information density is high, and the final image lands with crisp clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling lore, bone-setting ritual, and metaphorical constellations feels fresh and inevitable; specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform familiar tropes; risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
