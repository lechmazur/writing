<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's reckless skepticism sharpens into fascinated engagement, with embodied micro-choices under pressure. His final offering of the valve wheel is earned by prior curiosity and the ghost shift's pressure, though the "swallowed truth" motivation remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the hush. The valve wheel's return and the ghost-shift concept shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet concrete, clanking) are filtered through Elias's urgency. The mill and tunnel constrain choice; the beaded valve wheel charges the final image by returning to halt the ghost shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to confrontation under causal agency. Elias's decision to offer the valve wheel tightens options and yields a visible cost—the hush that follows—reweighting the ghost-shift's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of haunted labor emerges through the ghost shift and the faceless figure, not statement. The final hush offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with a consistent, textured voice that reflects Elias's perceptual bias. No head-hopping; elision (psychic advice) is anchored and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("like a knife through stale bread") is purposeful; sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the charged hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ghost-shift concept transforms the haunted-mill trope through specific industrial detail and a non-supernatural haunting. Synthesis feels organic and inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
