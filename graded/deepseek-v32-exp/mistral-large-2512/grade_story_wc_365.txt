<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's sensory mapping profession and dream-driven motivation are concrete; interiority is embodied under pressure. The encounter with his other self tests his resolve, and his final choice is earned. Slight functionalism in the other Kael limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain from arrival to revelation is tight; orientation clear by ~120 words. Closure is a charged poise with legible cost ("the weight of that knowledge would crush us"); the inferred causal lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The repair bay is vividly rendered and functions as a nexus that pressures choices (console, gate); sensory details are selective and support atmosphere. The setting constrains action and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to multiversal truth via protagonist agency; cost is unmistakable on the page. The revelation forces a meaningful tightening and binary choice under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented reality and costly knowledge emerges organically from images (shard, scale, mirrors). The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct atmospheric texture; prose modulates with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Minor tendency toward poetic abstraction prevents the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong line-level craft with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no significant loops or scaffold. Minor overwrought phrasing ("cyclically spontaneous") is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parallel universes, sensory mapping, and metaphysical truth; the open ending takes effective risk. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
