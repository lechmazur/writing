<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like tracing wood grain and savoring the kettle's whistle. Her motivation to carve emerges credibly from the accumulated weight of memory and the object's "hauntingly practical" patience. The final choice—to carve a quiet lion, embodying containment over harvest—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the reconfigured peace. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses (running from grief vs. sitting with it) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the carved lion reconfigures her relationship to grief from escape to holding, with felt cost in the "bitterness" of tea and "muted light." Orientation is flawless within first paragraph. The wood blank's persistent constraint shapes the final image; cost is legible in the final sentence's "rust-hued peace."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV (damp wool, warped floorboards, silver rivulets). The ash wood blank functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The rain-beaded skylight evolves with the emotional arc, ending as a "sheet of muted light." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven into action and reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive deepening: Elara's internal stake (how to hold grief) tightens through reflective density and culminates in the carving act. Agency is her renunciation of "harvesting lessons" for the simpler, costlier action of "holding." The cost is legible on-page in the carved lion's "fierce and still" presence and the "bitterness" of the tea that grounds her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the wood blank, the lion image, the kettle ritual. Subtext is rich in lines like "grief wasn’t something to escape—it was something to contain." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the carved lion as a companion "here and gone in the same breath," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature (notices grain, steam "like tiny, drowning dancers"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, compressing in reflective beats and broadening in descriptive ones. No head-hopping. The voice is consistent, controlled, and apt for the accumulative, lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and devoid of scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("steam curling into the air like a ghost"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, from the slow build of the kettle's whistle to the decisive carving strokes. Information density is high; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lion tamer's widow, wood carving, and grief is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The quiet, accumulative approach to a well-trodden theme feels fresh through grounded, lived-in detail. Risk-taking in the lyric, reflective mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and follows its implications.</comment>
