<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; the final choice to plant the letter is earned by prior causality and shows a visible cost—the risk of Order retaliation versus his fear of silence. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are not applicable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (planting the letter) with felt cost; the causal lens holds tightly; orientation is clear within the first paragraph. The persistent constraint of the Order's networks shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (library under snow) constrains choice (the library is the lock) and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens—from possessing the letter to using the Mirror to planting it—with cost legible in the final beat. One meaningful tightening forecloses safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (silence vs. truth) emerges through concrete images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (the letter's contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and serves closure. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Premise of cryogenic memory archiving is a fresh synthesis; elements feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
