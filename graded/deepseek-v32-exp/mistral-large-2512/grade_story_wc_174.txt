<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her artistic identity; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "uncommonly serene," "raw"). The final choice to continue her work is earned by the reflection and the act of storytelling, with visible cost from the argument. However, the brother is not on-page, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("left her raw... clarified something"). Orientation is clear within 120 words (Liora in the dome at night). The ending image (candle guttering, light returning, smile) reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the dome's acoustics shape the performance, its history contrasts with Liora's purpose, and it charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (rusted ribs, lamp oil, candle shadows). The environment constrains choice and enriches theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling vs. dismissal) escalates through Liora's reflection and the act of telling a story. Agency drives a meaningful tightening—her decision to perform reweights the cost of her commitment. The cost is legible in the aftermath of the argument and her serene resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges organically from concrete particulars (puppet shows, story stick, echo story). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of renewed work. No moralizing; subtext is rich in the dome's repurposing and the brother's criticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and close to Liora's perception; voice is distinct, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled. The prose reflects her artistic sensibility without head-hopping. No dialogue, but narrative stance is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies naturally with the beats, and the final image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (calligrapher-puppeteer, story stick, radar dome) feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in accumulative, quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
