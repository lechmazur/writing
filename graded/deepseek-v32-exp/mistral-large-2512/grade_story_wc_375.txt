<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but internal conflict is minimal; the final choice is earned but lacks a visible, felt cost on the page. The mnemonic gift is stated rather than tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a charged poise with resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than legible in a specific on-page sentence, limiting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cave is vividly specific and atmospherically essential, charging the final image with its violet light and isolation, though it does not actively constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by protagonist agency, but pressure remains mystical rather than visceral, and the cost of the final act is not unmistakably felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of art redeeming loss emerges organically through imagery; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though depth is slightly limited by the lack of counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; rhythmic control and purposeful elision support the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid imagery and varied syntax; no loops or artifacts obscure closure, though occasional purplish phrasing ("slithered... like smoke") slightly tempers precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though capped due to high-band gate requirements.</comment>
