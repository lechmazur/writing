<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lena's grief and determination are concretely embodied, and her final choice to run with new understanding is earned by the ghostly encounter. However, contradictory impulses are not simultaneously active in scene, preventing the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with clear cost ("its heat searing her skin"). The geode and time pressure persistently shape tactics, and orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's rusted bones and cooling circuit breakers constrain choice and charge the final flight. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Lena's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding unused potential) tighten via the circuit-breaker clock and geode flare; Lena's agency in confronting the ghost escalates pressure, with cost legible in the searing crystal and alarms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief, choice, and potential emerges through concrete images (geode, wedding dress ash) and the scientist's log. The ending reconfirms the hunt with new weight, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. Voice modulates with pressure, and the sparse dialogue ("Show me") is goal-driven and natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with vivid figurative language that never muddles sense. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety propels the scene to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic hunter, geode crystal, and perturbation theory feels inevitable. Specificity in Lena's backstory and the observatory setting elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
