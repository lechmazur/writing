<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and drives the story, but characterization lacks internal contradiction and embodied emotion under stress, making him somewhat one-note. His final realization is earned by prior causality, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. No major flaws, but depth is limited for a high literary standard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain leads to a resonant Conceptual Repricing closure where repair is reweighted as remembering, with legible cost. Orientation is early and sharp, and the single-POV two-shard structure is handled seamlessly. Lacks the persistent constraint or price shaping tactics required for 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, atmospheric setting that filters through Elias's perception and crucially constrains choice (gears, hall of mirrors) and charges the final image. However, due to Q2 not reaching 9.0, the score is capped at 8.7 per the high-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning repair) escalates through Elias's agency under a causal lens, culminating in a realization that forecloses a path with conceptual cost. Pressure tightens meaningfully, though the escalation lacks a visceral, felt price that would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair as remembering emerges organically from particulars and is crystallized in the final image without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, though it leans slightly toward abstract conceptualization over embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. No dialogue, but prose rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent. Lacks the transformative elision or rhythmic risk-taking for the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density, varied syntax, and no line-level artifacts or loops. Figurative language is purposeful and clear. Capped at 8.7 due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 threshold for category 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (library, gears, mirrors) into a specific, evocative whole that feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed and integrated, though it doesn't take bold structural risks that would elevate it further. Capped at 8.7 per the high-band gate.</comment>
