<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove her theory is clear and drives all key choices; interiority is concrete via embodied emotion (trembling hands, heart pounding) and micro-choices under pressure (overriding protocols, syncing frequency). The final realization carries cost, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change—she proves her theory but faces the collapse and weight of truth, with cost legible in "alarms blared" and "the weight of it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (bioluminescent algae, gas giant) and integrates seamlessly with action; the magnetic nexus and lever function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving time moves sideways) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency—overriding safety, syncing hum, pulling lever—narrowing options and yielding clear on-page cost (nexus collapse, alarms, weight of knowledge).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear time and cost of knowledge emerges through particulars (xenos' wings, nexus manipulation) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material via a resonant, non-literal answer—Elara’s laugh of wonder/despair and the xenos as timekeepers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanic's precision blended with lyricism); voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., holographic principles) is taught and pays off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied rhythm and purposeful figurative language ("like heat haze given form"); no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of sideways time is fresh and synthesized with specific world-building (sky mechanic, xeno-timekeepers); turns feel earned, and risk-taking (lever pull, nexus collapse) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
