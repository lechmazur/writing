<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied (stomach clench, trembling hands). Her final micro-choice (pressing the tile flake) is earned by prior causality and reveals a shift from forcing patterns to listening. Maren provides secondary pressure. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mandala stills and glows, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost—the weight of unsaid things. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, with pattern and density building to this moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto and sand mandala are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Liora's POV. The environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (search for meaning) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to listen leads to a deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in her physical and emotional reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (unlearning, whispers, tile flakes) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the glowing mandala, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, artist-filtered). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (the unlearning) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chalk artist, whispering grotto, and societal unlearning feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking with quiet, atmospheric climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific and fresh.</comment>
