<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora's esoteric realism is vividly embodied, driving her actions to honor impermanence; final endurance is earned with visible cost, though internal contradiction is subtle, capping at 8.8 under the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant cost under an accumulative lens; orientation clear, persistent constraint of transience shapes tactics; cost legible in "she knew they would not return. Not this year, perhaps not ever."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's moss-draped weight charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrating with Liora's perception to constrain the closure's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of interrupted migration escalate through monarchs' arrival; agency in building signals forecloses a path with cost, though escalation is textural rather than causally driven, capping at 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemera and memory emerges through concrete particulars; ending's "signal had been sent" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature of an esoteric realist; POV stability and rhythmic control under pressure support the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative without loops or scaffold; figurative language is voice-motivated, and rhythm varies naturally, with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of impermanence and migration; specific details like moth wing and Oaxaca woman feel inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes.</comment>
