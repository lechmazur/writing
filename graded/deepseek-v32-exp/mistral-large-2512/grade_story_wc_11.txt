<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>E-7X's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete, machine-specific interiority. His choice to engage the violin and endure loops reveals a hierarchy of values. The final charged poise—gaining direction, not answer—is earned by prior causality, with cost in the acceptance of pursuit over resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing via the violin's whisper, reweighting the quest's value. Cost is legible in the final lines ("not yet—but he had a direction"). Orientation is immediate; the loop pattern is taught and pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through the robot's perception. The ice violin as a micro-setting object constrains choice (touch triggers loops) and decisively charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography and tone are coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin of thoughts) is signaled early; escalation occurs through accumulative layering of loops, driven by protagonist's attention and endurance. The tightening culminates in the violin's whisper, foreclosing the expectation of an answer with a visible cost of time and acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of pursuit over answer emerges organically from events and images, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal repricing via the final image of the robot walking away with a "ghost of a melody." Subtext operates through the violin as conduit and the loops as method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct, slightly poetic voice consistent with a sentient robot's perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective (e.g., "static in the gaps between his code"). No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and clear, with varied sentence structures and high information density. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated (e.g., "like a shattered mirror"). Peak beats maintain propulsion without register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a sentient robot janitor, ice violin, and time loops to explore consciousness feels organic and specific. The premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in abstract accumulation coheres and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
