<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies (scholar/thief, "weight of her purpose"). Interiority is concrete and embodied ("pressed upon her like the gravity of forgotten gods"). The final choice—taking the scroll with resolve—is an Earned Stasis of endurance, credible given her year-long search. A minor weakness: the "diminutive titan" descriptor, while vivid, is more asserted than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Charged Poise: Liora secures the rune, the "pause" of constellations ends, and she moves to act ("The time for unmasking had come"). Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of continued hiding and the weight of being "the unbroken." Causal lens holds tightly: her discovery stems directly from following clues (iron gall ink, cryptic messages). Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining and enabling choice: the library's decay mirrors the forgotten truth, and the hollow shelf is a key resource. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("Dust swirled in the dim light," "parchment brittle with age"). The "stone arches sagging" and "cracked stained glass" establish tone and pressure. The library itself charges the final image of hidden truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking the pretender) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the causal lens: each discovery (ink pellet, map) narrows her path to the rune. The cost is the burden of being "the unbroken" and the imminent confrontation. The tightening is meaningful, moving from search to possession of the key tool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. erasure, history's weight) emerges organically from concrete particulars: iron gall ink that eats paper, a rune that rewrites history. Subtext operates in the contrast between the library's silence and the pretender's lies. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "truth, written in iron gall ink and hidden in the margins of the world." Avoids direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("each mote a silent witness"). Voice is textured and controlled ("a diminutive titan... in the weight of her purpose"). Prose reflects Liora's scholarly precision mixed with latent power. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on narrative voice, which is consistently sharp and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and varied syntax. However, there is minor overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "a pause in the sky’s endless dance, a breath held too long" verges on decorative). Information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts. The final paragraph propels cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a scholarly quest, a time-bending rune, and a political usurpation feels organic and fresh. The "rune of drift" is a non-obvious twist on a magic sigil. The perspective of a "diminutive titan" in a decaying library is memorable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details like the iron gall ink and the focus on archival silence.</comment>
