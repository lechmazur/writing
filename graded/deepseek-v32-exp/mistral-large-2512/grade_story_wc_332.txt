<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and earned change, but lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict under pressure, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear and closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost; the mosaic structure with multiple time shards is legible and coherent, though the convenient appearance of the palette slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (the archipelago's islands, the library's height); the watercolor palette and camera charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in painting and photography, tightening the stake of capturing the dream with clear cost in patience and effort; one meaningful deepening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of longing emerges through concrete images and actions; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Not yet, but I will," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable in third-person limited POV; dialogue is minimal but fitting. Score capped because Q2 is below 9.0, per the global 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no scaffolding or figurative muddle; score capped because Q2 is below 9.0, per the global 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream, light-painting, and photography feels fresh and inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes. Score capped because Q2 is below 9.0, per the global 9+ gate.</comment>
