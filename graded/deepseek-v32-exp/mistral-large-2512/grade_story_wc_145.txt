<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's dry-witted precision and deeper quest for convergence are concretely embodied through tactile interactions (tracing atlas, observing condensation) and micro-choices. Her final decision to go onto the ice is earned by the accumulated clues and her professional obsession, with a visible cost in the "worrying tranquility." No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains specific and pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterns of condensation, maps, and phrases build density toward a charged poise closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The convergence of the falcon's message and the phrasebook note triggers Mira's decisive request, reconfiguring options with felt risk on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are not just backdrop; the condensation pattern becomes a map of time that directly shapes Mira's realization and choice. Sensory details (groaning beams, breath curling) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her cartographic perception, constraining action and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the convergence) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative pattern-breaking: the condensation as map, the phrasebook note, and the keeper's echo tighten the quest. Mira's agency in demanding to go to the lake forecloses safety with a cost legible in the falcon's "worrying" cry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory, origin, and the limits of knowledge emerge organically from concrete particulars—the blank map, the dog-eared phrasebook, the condensation pattern. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the lake's center as threshold, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that matches Mira's precise, cartographic mind. Voice modulates naturally from observation to realization; the keeper's dialogue is sparse but legible. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences vary naturally; figurative language ("like a forgotten thought," "metronome counting down") is precise and integrated. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of an atlas editor's quest with metaphysical convergence feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details (polyglot's phrasebook, condensation as time-map) transform the familiar search-for-origin trope through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in quiet atmosphere pays off.</comment>
