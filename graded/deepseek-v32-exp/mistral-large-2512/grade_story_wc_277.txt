<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's death, with interiority shown through the nib and her observational trait. Her shift from passive cataloguer to active intervener is earned. Some emotional beats ("hollow as the observatory’s echoing halls") verge on abstract but are anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly. Closure is a Charged Poise: her decision to step into the light, reconfiguring options with felt risk. Orientation is immediate. Cost is legible in the final image and the journalist's warning, though the final act's physical stakes remain implied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (gaslight, iron gall scent). The city lights as a "constellation of lies" effectively mirrors internal state. Spatial choreography is clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) escalates through her sequenced decisions: writing letters, then arranging a meeting. Agency drives each turn under the causal lens. Cost is visible in her acceptance of being watched. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth, observation, and legacy emerge organically through the nib, the erased obituaries, and the "orbits of regret." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her poised intervention. No moralizing. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 not reaching 9.0 gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, analytical, and filtered through an astronomer's mindset. Prose rhythm controls tension. No head-hopping. The radio dialogue is crisp and goal-driven. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Figurative language ("perched like a forgotten god") is consistent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts. Minor risk of ornate density in places, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of observatory mystery and ink-media legacy. The rosewood nib as both weapon and heirloom is a specific, non-obvious choice. Risks lyrical density but integrates it coherently. Transformation of familiar tropes through grounded detail. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 gate.</comment>
