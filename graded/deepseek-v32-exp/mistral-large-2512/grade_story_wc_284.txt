<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—leaving the pillbox—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (scars no longer aching). No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate choices credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (taking the file) with felt cost on-page ("his scars didn’t ache"). Orientation anchors who, where, when within 120 words. Persistent constraint (pillbox/key) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (codes in snow, door) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV. The mist, bluff, and thaw evolve consistently with plot, avoiding cliché. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing vs. carrying forward) escalates through protagonist agency (opening pillbox, using key). Cost is legible in emotional shift and foreclosed path. One meaningful tightening—the door opening—narrows options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (pillbox, codes, key) without direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: "some things were never meant to be fixed—only carried forward." Subtext operates in image and implication; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (past fire) is taught and paid off. Voice is consistent and character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms burned spy trope through specific, grounded details and emotional depth. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet, introspective ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection in final reconfiguration.</comment>
