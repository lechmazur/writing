<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's grief is concretely embodied through tactile interaction with tools and jewelry. His micro-choice to follow the origami trail demonstrates motivation rooted in longing. The final choice to apply the stencil is an Earned Stasis that forecloses pure mourning with visible cost. However, Liora's spectral appearance to deliver the thematic lesson feels slightly convening, reducing the agency of his internal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of origami clues builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with clear cost ("weight...loosening") and reconfigures the city's stalled time. Orientation is immediate and vivid. The mystery of the origami's source is left purposefully open, serving the lyric pattern rather than breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, POV-filtered detail that pressures choice and charges the final image. The observatory's frozen gears, the "genuinely artificial" rose, the whispering books—all are woven into action and reflect Elias's state. The observatory as micro-setting crucially constrains the climax, training the telescope on the lost constellation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional survival/grief management) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates texturally via the origami trail, tightening decisively at the final observatory climb. Agency is present in his choice to follow each clue. The cost is legible in his physical tremor and subsequent release. The escalation is slightly passive, as the trail unfolds for him rather than through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief as wearable, not drownable, emerges powerfully through concrete particulars: the ring, stencil, origami, final tattoo. The "wither to bloom" insight is earned via the journey's accumulated images and avoids moralizing. The final image of the thorned vine on his wrist offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the story's core conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("arched like a sigh," "dust motes swirled in the slanted light"). The lyrical voice modulates naturally with emotional intensity, maintaining control under pressure. No head-hopping. The child's brief dialogue is natural and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. One minor strain: the scent of lavender on years-old origami slightly stretches credibility, but does not obscure cause/effect or dull closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mourning jewelry, celestial observation, and an origami-guided quest feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The emotional truth is specific, avoiding generic grief templates. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail.</comment>
