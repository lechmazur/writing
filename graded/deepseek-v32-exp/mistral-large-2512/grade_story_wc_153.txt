<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire) acting in scene. The final endurance—keeping the letter unsent but reweighted as a first step—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on the page. Orientation is clear early; the persistent constraint of the unsent letter shapes the final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vividly specific and pressure choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The environment constrains Liora's quest and reconfigures at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting regret) is signaled early; escalation is driven by Liora's agency (pressing the shard, speaking her fear) under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the scar's fading and the letter's unresolved weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of regret and forgiveness emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the unsent letter as a first step—that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (medium's backstory) is anchored in present cues. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Figurative language ("roots twisted like fingers of a drowning man") is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (unsent letter, supernatural healing) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of setting and emotional truth avoids template.</comment>
