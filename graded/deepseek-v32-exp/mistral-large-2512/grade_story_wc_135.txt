<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions; Liora's visionary trait drives pursuit with cost felt at closure. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored, limiting emotional complexity for a full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with logical progression from duty to discovery; closure lands with decisive knowledge change and felt cost in "the weight of the valves heavy in her hands." Orientation is immediate, but revelation leans slightly explicit, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create atmosphere; valves as micro-setting constrain choice and charge the final image. However, Q2 not ≥9.0 caps this category per global gate, though execution is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering erased history escalates through Liora's agency in collecting valves; climax reveals truth with conceptual cost. Escalation is coherent but not exceptionally tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges through fragments and the map, with subtext in "they erased us." Ending resonates without moralizing, though dialogue slightly states theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical prose reflecting Liora's perception; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Voice remains distinct under pressure, but not quite 9.0 level.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively. Capped due to Q2 not ≥9.0, though line-level craft is very strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh concept of ocean-spray archivist and valves as map pieces synthesizes tropes with specific details. Revelation feels earned, but originality is not groundbreaking.</comment>
