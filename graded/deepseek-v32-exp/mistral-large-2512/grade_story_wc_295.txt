<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation intensifies under pressure; the shift from chronicler to witness to leader is earned by prior beats. However, the final choice ("He knew what he had to do") leans slightly toward summary, costing a fraction of immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (gathering dreamers) with felt cost ("the burden was theirs to carry, but not alone"). Orientation is immediate; the telegram and dreams link because/therefore to the realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the observatory dome, brass eyepiece, and daylily telegram filter through Elias's perception. The observatory as micro-setting constrains choice (chronicling vs. acting) and charges the final image of shared burden under the stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding/sharing the burden) escalates through dreams and telegram; Elias's agency drives a meaningful tightening when he shifts from decoding to witnessing. Cost is legible in the weight pressed on the dreamers and his decision to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically from inscriptions, dreams, and the daylily metaphor without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the decision to gather dreamers, though the final paragraph edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical texture; voice modulates with pressure ("the dome groaned... distant whispers"). No dialogue, but perceptual signature is strong and syntax controls rhythm under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentences advance story and atmosphere without overwriting. The closing lines land with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream chronicling, celestial mapping, and temple inscriptions feels fresh and inevitable. The daylily telegram and variable-star metaphor add specificity without gimmickry. Risk-taking in quiet climax is coherent and heightens stakes.</comment>
