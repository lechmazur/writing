<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (duty, guilt) is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final choice. His internal conflict is embodied in specific memories ("the brother he’d failed to save") and the tactile hesitation before touching the key. The final choice to take the key and bear its weight is a credible earned endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight reliance on summary in depicting his regret ("guilt coiled in his chest") rather than fully dramatized contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear and holds: Elias acts because he knows the key's danger, therefore he disrupts the scavenger, therefore he must retrieve it himself. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as he accepts the weight of his guilt; the cost is legible in his trembling fingers and the "quiet, steady pulse" of the key. Orientation is immediate and functional. The one minor flaw is the scavenger's arrival being slightly convenient, but it does not break causality or touch the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail ("wooden piers creaking like old bones," "frost settled into their cracks") and actively constrains choice—the ice's instability risks drowning, the lighthouse's sonic beacon is a tactical tool. The key itself functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The marina's atmosphere is seamlessly woven into action and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the key from misuse) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the causal lens: from observation, to disruption, to the perilous retrieval. The cost is visible and felt—Elias risks drowning and must confront his guilt. Agency drives each turn. A minor deduction as the scavenger's defeat (shattered tuning fork) resolves a bit quickly, slightly softening the middle pressure before the final personal test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (absolution as carrying weight, not forgetting) emerges powerfully from the concrete action of handling the key and Elias's personal history. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the key's shifting song and the lighthouse's hum. The concept of "sonic absolution" is fully integrated into stakes and character choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's professional (resonator, frequencies) and personal lens. Voice has a distinct, slightly mythic texture that remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the scavenger's line ("Too late, keeper") carries subtext. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally concise, with strong rhythmic control ("The ice groaned beneath them, the marina settling back into silence"). Minor artifacts: some mild phrasing redundancy ("low, resonant hum vibrated") and a slightly over-extended metaphor ("his breath no longer a ghost in the cold"). These do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, but they prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic technology, psychological guilt, and a frozen relic milieu feels fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The final reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) feels inevitable in hindsight. It avoids being a derivative template through its emotional specificity and commitment to its premise.</comment>
