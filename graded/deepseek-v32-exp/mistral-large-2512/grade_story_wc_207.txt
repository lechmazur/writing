<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation and interiority are clear, rooted in curiosity and connection to his grandfather, but lack contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to collect the mist is earned by prior causality, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally personal, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with conceptual cost (earth waking up, grandfather transformed). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the compass persistently shapes tactics. Minor deduction because the grandfather’s appearance, while thematically fitting, feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (petrichor, bioluminescence) filtered through Elias’s perception. The subterranean lagoon charges the final image, but the setting’s constraint on choice is indirect, and Q2’s score caps this category at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (the delve) under an Accumulative lens, tightening toward the revelation. Cost is legible in the grandfather’s transformation and the understanding of the factory’s closure, though the stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (earth’s memory, industrial loss) emerges through concrete images and the final non-literal answer (“the breath of the world waking up”). No moralizing, but Q2’s score caps this category at 8.8 despite resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct poetic texture and perceptual signature. Voice modulates with atmospheric pressure, and no head-hopping. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2’s score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, dense prose with varied rhythm and no scaffolding or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2’s score, though line-level craft is exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of petrichor, geological memory, and familial loss feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical, atmospheric approach heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Capped at 8.8 due to Q2’s score.</comment>
