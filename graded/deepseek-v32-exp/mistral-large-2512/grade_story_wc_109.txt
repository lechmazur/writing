<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Oracle's obsession and final renunciation are earned through concrete actions; interiority is embodied in tactile details like tracing pebbles and the booklet's dust. The quiet transformation from seeker to one who "did not feel the need to speak" carries visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; motivation intensifies under pressure of the dimming star.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible as the booklet crumbles and she lets go. Orientation anchors early (storm, fort, shore). The star's disappearance acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics, and the final image reweights silence with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective (marbled hush, salt spray, wet earth). The ridge fort and pebble shore constrain choice and charge the final image—the fort becomes a gateway, the pebbles echoes. Object-as-setting (booklet) evolves and dissolves, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density increase: star dimming, booklet tracing, silence summarizing tighten the stake of mapping the endless night. Protagonist agency drives each beat; cost is unmistakable in the booklet's dust and her shed weight. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence and mapping emerges organically from images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates through gesture (letting tide take gold leaf) and the final, non-literal answer: "let the silence be enough." No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like the ambered hush and marbled blue sky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (oracle's obsession with polished pebbles and silence). Poetic voice controls rhythm and diction under pressure; no head-hopping. Purposeful elision (booklet's mystery) pays off in map realization. Lexicon matches character's lyrical world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("ambered hush," "marbled blue") is consistent and purposeful. Closure image sharp; read-aloud ear test passes without momentum drag or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle, silence, and map-making; specific details (gold leaf booklet, pebble shore) feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story would fail with generic elements; authenticity of vision coheres.</comment>
