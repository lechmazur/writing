<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are concrete; his final shift from tourist to helper is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the parasol tip gift and clipboard acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "didn’t feel like a tourist anymore"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern shifts; orientation is clear early and persistent constraint (parasol tip) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains choice and charges the final image through sensory specificity; the parasol tip as micro-setting object recurs with reweighted meaning, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency (listening, giving parasol tip, taking clipboard); cost is legible in his realization of "windborne solace," reweighting the dominant stake of seeking endings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of solace in others' endings emerges through particulars without moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the parasol tip and clipboard, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistently poetic yet grounded; elision (e.g., "fold in patience") is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; no loops or scaffold artifacts; prose propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism and disaster relief in a vivid setting; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
