<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is clear and her final realization is earned through embodied, sensory experience. Minor deduction for abstract phrasing nearing therapy-speak ("her fears unravel, her questions dissolve") in the peak beat, slightly blunting the concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held cleanly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost: the compass ring points inward, she carries the song within. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Liora’s unique perception, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of sensory and emotional pressure, culminating in her choice to stand still. The cost is legible in the ring growing cold and pointing inward, foreclosing the option of external navigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal mapmaking emerges organically from particulars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("a home in the silence between the notes") without moralizing, reweighting the journey's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct. Lyrical, sensory prose is consistent with the protagonist’s perception, creating a strong perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely precise and propulsive, but minor artifacts: a mixed metaphor ("leaves trembling like the strings of an untuned violin" juxtaposed with "hum in her bones") and the slightly contradictory "quiet blaze." These do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, specific synthesis of blindness, emotional cartography, and ultrasonic ecology. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded sensory detail and character-specific perception.</comment>
