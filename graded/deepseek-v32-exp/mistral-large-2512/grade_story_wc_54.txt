<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity and pattern-seeking are consistently embodied through concrete observations and micro-choices; her final acceptance of the sextant and new understanding feel earned. The woman's weary resilience provides secondary pressure, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as details build to a conceptual repricing of hope; closure lands with cost in the woman's weariness and the decay/growth contrast. Orientation is clear early, causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terminal is vividly rendered and actively guides exploration; the sextant piece charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's engineering perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning) escalates through Mara's active curiosity, leading to a revelation about resilience. Cost is legible in the woman's endurance, though escalation is quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images, but the final paragraph states it explicitly, slightly reducing resonance. The core idea of hope as redirecting flows remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending engineering and wonder. Prose rhythm and diction are controlled; dialogue (brief) is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative language. No noticeable loops or scaffolds; momentum is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil engineering, spaceport decay, and redirected flows feels fresh and specific. Grounded details and a nuanced emotional arc avoid cliché, offering a non-obvious perspective on resilience.</comment>
