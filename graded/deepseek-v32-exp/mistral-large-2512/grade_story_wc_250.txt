<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's silent empathy is consistently embodied through micro-choices (mirror, pebble) and rooted in a clear motive. Interiority is shown via tactile perception, though internal contradiction is minimal; the final endurance is earned with visible cost in her solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the final image of continued weaving. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (cobalt dock, rain-slick planks) are selective and POV-filtered; the dock, shutters, and dental mirror function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching through silence) escalates via Maris's agency under the accumulative lens—the girl's challenge tightens into a patterned exchange. Cost is felt in the child's transformed fear and Maris's lonely persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges organically from concrete images and actions; the ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer through the final weave/stars image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature attuned to patterns and silence. Dialogue (the girl's lines) is natural and goal-driven, supporting subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("stitched together by an unseen hand") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The silent-guardian premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a risk-taking commitment to minimal dialogue; synthesis feels inevitable, with freshness in the concept of weaving silence as craft.</comment>
