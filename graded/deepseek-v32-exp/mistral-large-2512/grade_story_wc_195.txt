<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aldric's withdrawn state and desire for possibility are clear and embodied, with micro-choices culminating in an earned renunciation. The woman is slightly archetypal but applies effective pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; causal linkages tighten to a decisive closure—Aldric unsnapping his sword belt—with visible cost and a persistent constraint (the orchard's reality-thinning).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly sensory and actively thins reality, directly constraining Aldric's choices and charging the final image with mystical light and tangled strings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing possibility) escalates through the woman's prompts and the marionette vision to Aldric's irreversible choice, with cost legible in the discarded sword.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of puppeteering vs. dance emerges through concrete images and dialogue; the final line reweights prior material without moralizing, though it edges toward explicit resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Aldric's poetic perception; voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, with dialogue that advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, high information density, and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical orchard, marionette theater, and withdrawn knight feels fresh and inevitable; risks with poetic style pay off in a transformative closure.</comment>
