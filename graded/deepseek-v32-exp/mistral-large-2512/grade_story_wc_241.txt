<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and motive-driven; her probability-flavored interiority and the "clover melancholy" moment are slightly abstract but not diagnostic. The final choice to "burn the numbers" is earned by prior causality (the clues, the lantern, her father's notes) and forecloses a path with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure (tracing the ink, using the matchbook) reveal her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (subway scrawls, library, archives, lantern) links via because/therefore. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing—the father's theory reweights the rule-set of probability and gambling—with cost legible in her determination to pay debts differently. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (mica-pane lanterns, wet parchment scent) and constrains choice: the library's restricted archives and the lantern itself are necessary for the revelation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The lantern charges the final image, but the environment doesn't decisively narrow options earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering father's truth to resolve debts) escalates via causal agency: following clues, burning the lantern. One meaningful tightening occurs at the lantern ignition, which changes knowledge and narrows her options. Cost is visible in her pressed ribs and resolved plan. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of probability, rebellion, and seeing through illusions emerges through particulars (equations, gambling aphorisms) without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The house doesn't always win...") that reweights prior material. Avoids moralizing; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Elara's probability mindset ("fluent enough to hear the punchline"). Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with strong information density (e.g., "ink bleeding into the vinyl like veins"). Minor overwriting in "clover melancholy" is a hairline slip but doesn't obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory, literary mystery, and gambling debt feels organic. The "lucid contradictions" concept and mica-pane lantern are specific, non-obvious choices that heighten stakes. Turns feel earned in hindsight; avoids template plot. Bold risk-taking in the conceptual repricing ending.</comment>
