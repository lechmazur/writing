<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied. The shift from recapture to understanding is a micro-choice that reveals his values under pressure. Liora is less developed but serves as a resonant counterpoint. The final choice is earned by the accumulated clues and memories, with cost felt in the fog swallowing them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final image of the fog swallowing them and the ship drifting on alone. Orientation is immediate; causality is clean through memory and clue progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship is a visceral, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elias's perception, with the garden of forgotten names serving as a powerful, non-literal setting that reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Liora/truth) escalates through accumulative density of clues and eerie encounters. Agency is present in Elias's pursuit and final correction to "understand." Cost is legible in the final separation and the ship's continued drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and unkindled solace emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Liora's choice and the fog, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, atmospheric perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; minimal dialogue carries subtext. No head-hopping; elision and compression are purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs; closure image is crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of carnival ship, chimera twins, and garden of forgotten names feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
