<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's reckless idealism and fiercely gentle nature are embodied in concrete choices under pressure; the pivotal memory trade-off is earned by prior desperation and carries visible cost when she forgets her brother's voice and smile, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("Some holes couldn’t be patched—they could only be carried") with undeniable cost, and the orchard's barter rule persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not just vivid backdrop—its roots threading through bones actively constrain the bargain and charge the final image when they tremble after the seed is planted, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieving her brother) escalates through protagonist agency: the stranger’s offer forces a concrete, costly choice—trading her most painful memory—tightening options irrevocably with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the barter economy and Liora’s mending; the final line reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about carrying loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is consistently lyrical and perceptually biased ("moth wings and threadbare patience"); elision (the seed’s outcome) is purposeful and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied rhythm and zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("forgotten lung," "scorched petals") is precise and heightens pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-as-ledger, bartered destinies, and memory trade feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a within-band bonus.</comment>
