<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she lacks internal contradiction or deep flaw, making her determination feel one-note despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain leads cleanly to a decisive closure with conceptual cost (silence after capture), though the emotional weight of that cost is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bone towers and echo tunnel are vividly specific and constrain choice; the diamond functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are artistic/intellectual; escalation is driven by Elara’s agency, culminating in a trade-off (captured echoes for canyon silence) that is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of translation and preservation emerges organically; the ending reweights the death of language without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV with a lyrical, consistent voice; perceptual signature is distinct and rhythm controlled, though no dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive with no artifacts; figurative language is precise and supports clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echoes, bone towers, and flawed diamond feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
