<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority ("fingers trembled," "stomach twisted"). Her final choice to flee with the ledgers is earned, though the climactic escape relies slightly on external rescue (Rourke's zeppelin), slightly diminishing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): truth is safe "for now," but the past "waited beneath the dunes." Cost is legible in the lagoon swallowing the men and the lingering threat. Structure (two shards) is coherent with one clear transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and crucially constrains choice. The obsidian lagoon is the central, charged object that determines the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("water cold as a corpse's touch," "scent of salt and gun oil").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) escalates cleanly via Elara's agency: deciphering diary, journey, parley, retrieval. The arrival of the men tightens options, and the cost is visible (the men are swallowed). The lagoon's supernatural resolution slightly complicates but doesn't undercut earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of the past's inescapable weight emerges organically from the central conflict and is crystallized in the final, resonant image. Avoids moralizing. Subtext operates in the lagoon as a metaphor for buried history. The "retrocognitively trapped" concept integrates well but borders on explicit theme statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable, close third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature (archivist's lens). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Prose rhythm is controlled, though there is a minor register drift in phrases like "retrocognitively trapped," which feels slightly technical for the POV's interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong momentum. No repetitive loops or scaffold. Figurative language is effective and coherent ("graveyard of driftwood and shattered glass"). Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating through the climax. One minor synonym churn ("rusty lockbox"/"rusted key") but negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical mystery and supernatural horror feels fresh and organic. The zeppelin library and retrocognitive trap are inventive, specific inflections that heighten stakes. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
