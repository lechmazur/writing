<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ryn's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing ice, clutching stone). Interiority is specific but lacks deep contradictory impulses; final choice to anchor the bloom is earned with visible cost, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the bloom's collapse and the stone's pulse, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and actively pressures choices (warping caves, fragile bloom). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image, with the stone and bloom serving as micro-settings that alter options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving silence) escalates through Ryn's agency under causal lens; cost is unmistakable when the bloom collapses. Pressure tightens meaningfully, though internal conflict is secondary to external threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of carrying fragments of peace emerges organically from events and images. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the stone's stolen silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., light conjuring) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise, rhythmic, and high-density with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear; sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh specificity (harmonic caves, bloom of hush). Turns feel earned through character choice; risk-taking in tone and setting heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
