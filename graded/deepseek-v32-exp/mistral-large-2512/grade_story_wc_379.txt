<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and interiority are clear, embodied through concrete actions (holding the locket, not opening it, asking around). Her final choice to wait and not approach Clara is earned by her established trait of deep listening. The cost of restraint is felt, though her agency remains observational, fitting the theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story builds through gathered clues and sensory details to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the mailbox. Closure lands with visible cost (Clara's shaking shoulders, red eyes). The mailbox and locket constraints shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elara's perception; the courtyard and mailbox constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, creating atmosphere that supports the quiet climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through Elara's investigation, deepening the mystery and leading to a cadence shift. The stake (emotional healing) is reweighted with legible cost in Clara's reaction. Agency is in Elara's listening and restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening and healing emerges through particulars, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of Clara reading the letter and Elara's reflection. Subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice. Rhythm and diction control are strong, modulating with emotional beats. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Elara's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Lines advance story and atmosphere efficiently; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (thrift-store curator, locket) through a quiet, observant lens. The perspective on listening as healing feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
