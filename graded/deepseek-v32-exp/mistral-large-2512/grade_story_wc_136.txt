<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent, with a clear professional lens ("meticulous route mapper") and concrete micro-choices (studying the punch, following arrows). Interiority is anchored in observation but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final choice aligns with established motive but the cost of stepping into the unknown is felt more conceptually than embodied on the page. No significant slips, but not reaching the highest band of contradictory interiority under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: punch arrival → discovery of arrows → manhole → encounter → decision. Closure is a Charged Poise (taking the woman's hand, tunnel trembling, whistle) that reconfigures options with undeniable pressure; cost is legible in the image of relinquishing the known world. Orientation is immediate; single-scene structure is tight. Lacks a persistent constraint that visibly shapes tactics, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and filtered through POV ("mist curling like smoke," "cracks spiderwebbed"). The ticket punch and manhole cover function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (warmth of punch, scent of ozone). Spatial choreography is clear. No inconsistencies; environment actively guides the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering hidden truths) is signaled early and escalates through discovered clues and the conductor's invitation. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, tightening with each find. Protagonist agency drives the escalation (choosing to follow arrows, lift the cover, take the hand). Cost is conceptual—stepping into the unknown—but not visceral enough for the highest band; the final trade-off is implied rather than felt with sharp immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of seeking hidden maps and unspoken truths emerges organically through concrete actions and imagery (arrows, punched tickets, "fortress of unspoken truths"). Subtext operates in implication (the conductor's dialogue, the punch's hum). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the charged poise of departure. Avoids moralizing; some ambiguity lingers, but the thematic echo in the conductor's dialogue ("maps no one else can see") verges on prompt-language, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a perceptually analytic signature ("patterns where others saw chaos"). Voice modulates purposefully with pressure (e.g., shorter sentences in discovery beats). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and advancing the mystery. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (the punch's origin) imposes cost. Rhythmic control is strong, though a slight uniformity in descriptive cadence prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propelled; sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently ("The starlit vault hung low"). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (mist "swallowing the streetlights"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Information density is high (e.g., the ticket punch's description does multiple jobs). Minor template cadence appears in a few sequential "He [verb]" structures, but not in peak beats and does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes urban mapping with supernatural mystery in a fresh, specific way. Tropes (magical object, hidden world) are transformed through grounded, analytical POV and precise detail (constellation-etched manhole, glass-jar archives). Emotional truth resides in the protagonist's drive to "dare to step beyond." Risk-taking in the quiet, charged poise ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Not fully revolutionary, but execution is cohesive and singular.</comment>
