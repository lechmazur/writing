<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's defiance and yearning are clear, with embodied interiority (copper lie) and a micro-choice under pressure (working faster as workshop dies). However, internal conflict is underdeveloped; his determination is mostly single-minded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure lands with a decisive change (bell rings, echo returns) and cost is legible (dying workshop forecloses future chances). Slight ambiguity in the cost of the bell's effect prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, corrosive setting pressures choices (acid sea rising, gears halting) and charges the final image (workshop stills). The bell and arrow tip function as micro-settings that constrain action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (ring bell before workshop dies) escalate through environmental pressure, driving Elias to a final agency. Cost is visible in the dying workshop, but the escalation is linear without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of yearning and defiance emerges through the bell's algorithm and the echo's return; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the felt echo) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (gears, acid, copper) and rhythmic control; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense, vivid prose with varied syntax and no scaffold loops; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm, acid-sea workshop, and cart-glider defiance; specific details create an organic, memorable world.</comment>
