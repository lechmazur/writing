<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and drives the narrative; her final choice to discard assumptions and tune for silence is earned by prior beats. However, interior contradiction is not heavily dramatized, and her emotional arc leans slightly abstract, though embodied moments like her quickening pulse anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the tower's fall and the fading fragment. Orientation is immediate, and the perigee's persistent constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio tower city and lunar perigee are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action and perception to amplify stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens—discarding assumptions to tune for silence—with unmistakable cost in the tower's destruction and her transcendence. The dominant stake tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and events, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The voice's line risks explicitness but is earned by the narrative's pattern, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Mira's mindset. Rhythmic control heightens pressure, and any elision serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, varying rhythm, and no loops or artifacts that obscure causality. Figurative language is consistent and supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signals, a Hollywood relic, and lunar perigee feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, philosophical conclusion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision is authentically singular.</comment>
