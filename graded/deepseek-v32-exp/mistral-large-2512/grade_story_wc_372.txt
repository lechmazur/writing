<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role; interiority is embodied through precise actions (trembling fingers, breath curling). His final commitment is earned by prior causality, but internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost ("The vow would endure. And so would he."). Orientation is immediate, and the resonant reconfiguration lands without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (frozen library's decay drives action) and charges the final image with ice and light; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's POV, achieving high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving meaning from oblivion) escalates through Elias's agency—placing the slide, adjusting frequencies—culminating in a cost-legible commitment. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges through concrete particulars (the slide, the vow) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Elias's realization and smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, meticulous perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (e.g., "quartz hush") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffolds; figurative language ("cathedral of ice") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival tropes with luminous magic; emotional specificity and risk-taking in accumulative design feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
