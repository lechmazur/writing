<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with death as a "colleague" shaping his perspective. His final choice to shatter the snow globe is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Minor weakness: internal conflict could be more pronounced, but for this length, characterization is exemplary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from discovery to understanding to release. Closure is a decisive change (shattering the globe) with felt cost in the hull's groan and death as an "invitation." Orientation is clear early, and the snow globe as a key provides a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (silt like ash, rusted pen) and crucially constrains choice: the deep-sea environment pressures the dive, and the snow globe as a micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elias's professional perspective, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) escalates through protagonist agency: finding the globe, meeting Liora, and actively shattering it. Cost is legible in the release and the invitation to death. One meaningful tightening under the causal lens, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically from images (snow globe, untangling threads) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: "Some threads aren’t meant to be held." Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, blending lyrical description ("silt like ash from a forgotten fire") with analytical precision. Voice modulates under pressure, and Liora's dialogue crackles with period-appropriate subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful ("bone dust," "silver plume") and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of deep-sea exploration, metaphysical time transmission, and historical mystery feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (snow globe as key, physics of letting go). Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
