<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses (disbelief vs. staying, freezing then looking) act in scene; her final choice to tend the cutting is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the buried photograph. Interiority is concrete and embodied, and her relationship with Mira functions as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the image of the buried photograph and the orchid’s defiance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and orientation is anchored within the first paragraph, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arboretum and terrarium function as micro-settings that constrain choice (Lena looks at the orchid when drones come) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena’s POV, with no generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Lena’s freeze at the drone sound triggers her choice to look at the orchid, tightening the internal stake of endurance versus despair. Cost is legible in the burial of the photograph and the tending of the cutting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (orchid, photograph, cutting) and subtext; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (“the quiet talent of roots”) that reweights prior material without moralizing. No abstract statements or prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV (Lena) is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent, lyrical, and modulated with emotional pressure; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence rhythm varies naturally. No overwriting or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma, horticulture, and somatic markers feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template plots or near-echoes of famous lines.</comment>
