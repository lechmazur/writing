<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and methodical nature are concretely embodied and drive her micro-choices; her final renunciation (to awaken empathy through art) is earned by prior causality. The sister is functional but the single POV focuses effectively on Elara's internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara integrates the lance into her sketch, making Liora "finally whole" with cost legible in the burden of witnessing. Orientation is immediate; the sister's arrival is slightly convenient but motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quarry mist and shadows are vivid, selective, and pressure choices (concealment, atmosphere); the ribbon and lance function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy/justice) escalates through causal turns: ribbon discovery, sister's testimony, lance revelation. Protagonist agency drives each; cost is felt in the final sketch's "dark line against the light." One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of seeing beyond surface emerges through particulars (face-blindness, masquerade, lance) without statement; final image offers a non-literal answer: integrating violence into memory to make the victim whole. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elara's face-blindness (hands as eyes). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; voice remains coherent under pressure, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with vivid imagery; no significant loops or artifacts. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately. Minor cliché ("jagged walls swallowing daylight") but does not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist, cold case, and unifying opposites (masquerade/lance) feels organic; specificity in character and object use elevates a familiar premise. Risk-taking in quiet, image-driven closure pays off.</comment>
