<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his motivation to "fertilize the idea of return" drives micro-choices like scattering seeds, culminating in Earned Stasis with cost in "his heart was not lighter." Contradictory impulses (hope vs. realism) are subtle but legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in the jetty's groan and Elias's heart. Orientation clear early; the dead reef and battlefield persist as constraints that shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through Elias's perception; the jetty, seed pods, and twilight atmosphere constrain action and charge the closure. Sensory detail (salt scent, groaning wood) is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming loss) is signaled early; under accumulative lens, density escalates through reflection and the seeding act, with cost legible in Elias's unresolved heart. Agency drives the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through patient action emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "the earth, he knew, was patient" without moralizing. Subtext in imagery (seed pods, heron) is rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Elias's "dead languages" lens filters sensory detail poetically. Rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("a vastness so narrow it felt like a wound") is consistent and clear, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic renewal through specific, grounded details like "submerged concord" and seed pods; risk-taking in quiet, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
