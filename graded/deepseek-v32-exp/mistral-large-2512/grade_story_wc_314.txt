<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses (wonder vs. quantification) act in scene; her final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality (flame failure, starlings, crystal) with visible cost in the shattering. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (crystal shatters, flame released). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; the "final transformation" timeframe adds pressure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (orchard, waterfall) and object (frozen dew crystal) are vividly filtered through POV and charge the final image. The crystal constrains choice and is indispensable to the climax, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: density of sensory detail and reflection deepens the internal stake; protagonist's agency (burying the crystal) leads to a clear cost (shattering, release). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (logic vs. intuition, acceptance of wonder) emerges through concrete particulars (flame, starlings, crystal); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight explicit statement mid-story does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's attention to patterns, crystals). Voice is consistent, lyrical, and modulates with emotional beats; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs. No clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar theme through specific, organic elements (alchemist, magical orchard, frozen dew crystal). Risk-taking in quiet internal climax heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
