<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of past resoluteness and present regret are embodied in scene; final renunciation to listen and let go is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the camera wheel sinks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise as she listens to stories, releasing weight; cost is legible in the sinking wheel and ghost's dissolution; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and disposable camera wheel constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the scavenger's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens builds density through fragments and ghost confrontation; protagonist agency in kneeling and listening forecloses her path of pretense with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of regret and acceptance emerges from concrete images and actions; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with rhythmic control under pressure; POV is stable and perceptual signature is consistent; ghost's dialogue carries subtext.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time unraveling and self-negotiation; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional truth is specific and complex.</comment>
