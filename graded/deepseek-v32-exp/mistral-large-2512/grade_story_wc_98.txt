<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and her hesitation is embodied, but her final resolve feels somewhat rapid, leaning on the dream for a decisive change without a deeper, contradictory struggle in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (planting seed, learning truth) with clear cost in the revelation of the monsoon's true nature, and the orientation is immediate and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ridge and blossoms are vividly woven into action and choice; the setting functions as a living archive that directly pressures the protagonist and charges the final image with transformed meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate via the monsoon's deadline; Liora's agency drives the tightening, and the cost of the revealed bargain is felt, though the escalation relies slightly on a convenient dream beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as a tended garden emerges organically from concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, anchored in the seed and the monsoon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Liora's perceptual signature; the lyrical prose modulates with emotional pressure, and dialogue (though brief) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with purposeful rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and heightens atmosphere without muddling clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes memory, storm, and reality-checking into a fresh, specific vision; the concept of the monsoon as memory-keeper is transformative and fully committed.</comment>
