<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("jealousy was a living thing, coiling in his gut"), and his endurance at the door is a credible stance crystallization. Motivation is clear, rooted in his profession and personal dread, compelling higher-stakes choices under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise (door opens) that reconfigures stakes with undeniable pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, density of dreams, scroll, and grave builds to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; cost is legible in the final suspense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the cabin's isolation and the mountain's presence constrain Elias and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("ink had bled," "wind howled"). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clarity/survival in time paradox) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative density (scroll, dreams, external threat). Final cadence shift reweights options with felt cost. Agency is endurance; one meaningful tightening suffices under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time, identity, and narrative emerges through concrete images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the door opens) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, melancholic voice. Perception is character-specific ("trying to distill chaos into narrative"). No head-hopping; dialogue (Harkin) is natural and goal-driven. Rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language is consistent and effective ("logs groaning like an old man"). No loops, scaffold, or artifact muddle; closure image is sharp and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of time loops is transformed through specific details (lucid dream chronicler, birch bark scroll) and emotional truth. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in ambiguous ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic and fresh.</comment>
