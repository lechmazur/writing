<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied; her decision to journey arises from the palpable weight of silence, and her final realization is earned by prior causality with visible cost—leaving the orchard unfinished.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration (silence as a beginning), cost is legible in the abandoned loom and shawl, and the accumulative lens holds firmly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting actively pressures choice (orchard's silence forces departure) and charges the final image; the bamboo forest and amber bead are recurring, tactile elements that constrain and reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens; the dominant stake (internal silence vs. action) tightens through her journey, with cost unmistakable in the unraveled tapestry and her renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—silence, memory, renewal—without statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through the image of Kael's skeleton and the bead's dimming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., "raveling silence") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and sharp, propelling momentum to the closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable—loom spinner, amber bead, raveling silence—with risk-taking in lyrical accumulation that heightens stakes and coherence, transforming familiar tropes through specific lived detail.</comment>
