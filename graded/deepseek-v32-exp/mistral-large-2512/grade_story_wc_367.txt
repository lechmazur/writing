<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her past; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting the lantern, reveal her values. The final commitment to step into the light is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the final image. The causal lens holds tightly from her actions to the vision. Orientation is immediate, and the lighthouse as persistent constraint shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like "salt-laced dark" are selective and purposeful, fully integrated into Veyra's perception and actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping a new dawn escalates through Veyra's agency as she interacts with the vision. The cost is felt in her readiness to step into the light, narrowing options and reweighting stakes under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of creation and legacy emerges through specific images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the city waiting and Veyra as architect, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Veyra's perception. Rhythmic control under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, especially in peak beats like the vision scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing lighthouse folklore with speculative elements. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
