<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear, rooted in trauma and desperate need; interiority is embodied and specific. His final choice (striking the fork) is earned by weeks of practice and carries the cost of irreversible hearing loss. The relationship with Liora applies pressure but remains secondary; his internal struggle between despair and persistence drives the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): silence gains a language through the heat-map display. The accumulative lens holds, building imagery to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image—the silence remains, but is reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the winterglass pane is the surface struck in the climax. The heat-mapper and tuning fork function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias’s heightened visual perception. The environment actively shapes the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify silence) is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency with the heat-mapper. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density increase, culminating in the fork strike. The cost is legible: the silence isn’t cured, but is given a new language, foreclosing the path of auditory recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—silence, loss, translation—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: silence becomes a canvas. Subtext operates through the tuning fork as salvaged hope and the heat-map as synesthesia. No abstract statements; the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elias’s deafness (visual/tactile focus). Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., sound described as ghostly echoes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; figurative language is pattern-taught and consistent. Sentences vary in rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Information density is high; every line serves character or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific: a deaf man uses a heat-mapper to translate silence into visual music. Synthesis of elements (tuning fork, winterglass, emotion mapping) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
