<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s ambition and sensory trait are concrete; her defiance with Nara and earned shift to patience show contradictory impulses under pressure. Final renunciation is causally tied to the grandmother’s journal, with cost in the waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that serenity lies in waiting reweights the premise with on-page cost. Causal-hybrid lens holds; orientation is immediate; the seed’s years-long bloom acts as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and filtered through Mira’s POV. The corpse flower seed and grandmother’s journal function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating serenity) escalates through Nara’s confrontation and the journal’s revelation. Mira’s agency drives the tightening; cost is legible in the acceptance of years-long waiting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically but is stated explicitly in the final paragraph (“Serenity wasn’t in the destination…”), constituting a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (olfactory focus). Voice is poetic yet consistent; dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of herbalist ambition, corpse flower lore, and treetop village feels organic. Quiet resolution transforms tropes through specific character choice and thematic cost.</comment>
