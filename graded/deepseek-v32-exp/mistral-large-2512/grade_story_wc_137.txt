<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs. wonder) acts in scene; final choice to transcribe is earned by tile and whale song causality. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, but the cost of change is more implicit than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear orientation; accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the final image of staying and returning. One meaningful tightening via tile activation and memory influx.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; tower and tile function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Salt-laden wind, whale songs, and glowing symbols are integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. belief) escalates under accumulative lens via whale songs and tile activation; protagonist agency (pressing tile, transcribing) drives tightening; cost is visible in commitment to listen and record.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and kindness emerges through concrete events and images, but final paragraph verges on thematic echo with stated wisdom, slightly reducing resonance. Otherwise, subtext and non-literal answer are strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, rhythmic prose modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping; purposeful compression in memory fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished, lyrical prose with high information density and varied sentence rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and clear; closure image remains undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (magic tile, skeptic) via specific details (whale migration, entangled memories) and emotional specificity; turns feel inevitable; avoids template plots.</comment>
