<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority and micro-choices under pressure are concrete; his final renunciation of the key tag is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The woman's sharp ache mirrors his, adding relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage from key tag to library to woman holds; closure lands with Charged Poise as Elias passes the key, reconfiguring his understanding of legacy with felt cost in the transfer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (salt, old paper, moonlight) are filtered through Elias's profession; the sunken ship library constrains his choice and charges the final image of lanterns on water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal hollowness to cosmic debt; Elias's agency in wandering, reading, and following tightens options until he pays the cost by relinquishing the key tag.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of light as language emerges through particulars like the book and lantern colors; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, via the image of sound's color.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with lyrical perceptual signature; dialogue is sparse but natural, and diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon while heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops; figurative language ("ribs of a dead whale") is consistent and vivid, and rhythm supports the crescendo to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lamplighter lore, luminous vows, and synesthetic truth feels inevitable; risk-taking in abstract concepts is grounded by specific, tactile detail.</comment>
