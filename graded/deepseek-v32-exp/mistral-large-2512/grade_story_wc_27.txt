<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and her motivation to find meaning is clear, driving her to touch the stone. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but internal contradiction in the peak moment is subtle, slightly limiting the emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost—hope reignited—under an accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate, and the stone circle's constraint shapes the ending decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image; the repair bay and stone circle are filtered through Lira's perception, constraining her choice to press against the monolith.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency as she responds to the hum, leading to a tangible cost in the realization about the rebellion's failure. One meaningful tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—broken rebellion, stones, opera glasses—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm and selective attention heighten pressure without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or figurative muddle. "Thunderous serenity" is slightly forced but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes, and risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
