<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies; interiority concrete ("breath shallow with wonder," "fingers trembled"). Final choice earned by prior causality. "Ethically playful" trait mentioned but not deeply dramatized, a minor slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (time as alive) with felt cost in the vision. Orientation clear early. Slight abstractness in climax reduces cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vivid and atmospheric, integral to choice; terra-cotta grotto pulses and breathes, constraining action and charging the final image. Sensory details selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (discover texture of time) escalate through pattern and density; final choice tightens options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting impact under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time as living illusion emerges through particulars; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in rope as key to freedom and understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, poetic voice consistent and character-specific; lyrical rhythm controls pressure. No head-hopping. Slight overwriting in peak beats does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose lush and rhythmic, with varied sentences. Some purple prose and cliché phrases ("whispering secrets") create minor artifacts, but information density remains high and closure clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (grotto, rope, time) through specific character and setting; risk in lyrical style pays off with coherent closure. Not groundbreaking but original.</comment>
