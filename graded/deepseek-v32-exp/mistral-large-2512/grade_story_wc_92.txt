<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied, but lacks internal contradiction, preventing higher marks. Her calm inventiveness is shown through micro-choices under pressure, earning the final signal. However, no contradictory impulses act in scene, so not 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from sundial to blackout to letter to torch. Closure lands on-page with cost: the revolution sparked, world holding its breath. Orientation early, structure seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressures choices: bioluminescent moss, blackout, fort corridors. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from start: spark a silent revolution. Escalation driven by Mira's agency: decoding sundial, stealing letter, lighting torch. Cost legible in the ending's implied combustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through images of sparks, cradles, and hushed actions. Subtext in the coded letter and torch signal. Ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet precise, reflecting Mira's expertise. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax. Figurative language is controlled ("dying heartbeat," "winking hush"). No loops or scaffold; closure beat clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lock-sentinel, sundial cipher, and silent revolution. Tropes transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
