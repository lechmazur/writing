<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's curiosity and diligence are concretely embodied through actions like tracing charts and noting patterns, driving the plot; however, internal conflict is minimal, limiting depth and contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is coherent with closure via decisive change, but the cost of the discovery is not legible on the page (e.g., no visible trade-off or price in the ending beat), reducing impact under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (brass hull, ozone scent) and key objects (hopscotch board, lantern) constrain choices and charge the final image; capped due to Q2 not meeting 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early and escalation is driven by Elias's agency, tightening from observation to discovery; but the cost of the victory is not felt, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden paths emerges organically from starlings, phrasebook, and hopscotch board, with a resonant non-literal ending; capped due to Q2 not meeting 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature filtering through Elias's curiosity; dialogue is natural but brief; capped due to Q2 not meeting 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with varied rhythm and no artifacts, efficiently advancing story; capped due to Q2 not meeting 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of airship cartography and starling murmurations feels organic and inevitable; capped due to Q2 not meeting 9.0 threshold.</comment>
