<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (trembling fingers, spongey dread). The final charged poise is earned by prior causality, though the shift from nervous confidence to dread is slightly abrupt but within bounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost felt in the storm's threat and Mira's decision. The nail's transformation to key tightens plausibly, and the final line reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (failing station, impending storm); the copper nail functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory details (mildew, ozone, groaning girders) are filtered through Mira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth and survival) escalates through Mira's agency; the nail's reveal and journal discovery narrow options with visible cost (storm, wailing alarms). The final image crystallizes pressure without resolution, maintaining tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of exile, legacy, and reversal emerge through coded journals and the nail; the final line ("Exile is reversible, but so is the sky") offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct; prose has a perceptual signature (weather-station precision, poetic dread). No dialogue, but internal voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (coded stanzas).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythms and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("like a dying man to a ledge") is selective and effective; peak beats maintain clarity without muddle. Information density high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather science, exile, and familial legacy feels inevitable; the reversible-exile concept transforms a familiar trope through specific detail (copper nail, coded stanzas). Risk-taking in lyric codes pays off at closure.</comment>
