<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's grief and reticence are embodied and drive his actions; his final choice to leave the sea glass is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (leaving the talisman); accumulative lens holds tightly across shards; orientation is immediate and pattern-teaching is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is a micro-environment that constrains choice; the sea glass and stones charge the final image; sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness/connection) escalates through accumulative density; protagonist agency in stacking stones and lighting the lamp drives tightening; cost is legible in the relinquished sea glass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action, not statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext operates in notes and stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is selective and character-specific; no dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion aligns perfectly with accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, mystery, and legacy; the anonymous note chain and stone-stacking method transform familiar tropes through specific, lived detail; risk-taking in quiet structure pays off.</comment>
