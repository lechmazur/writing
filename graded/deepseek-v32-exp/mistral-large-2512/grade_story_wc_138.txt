<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final endurance (accepting silence) is earned by prior causality, though her initial motivation is stated rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with felt cost (amulet inert, Kael gone, acceptance gained). Causal lens holds tightly; the solar storm as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting (escondite, storm) vividly pressures choices and charges the final image with sensory specificity. The prismatic environment and magnetic fields are integral to the conflict and climax, though the high-band cap applies due to Q2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what happens after goodbye) escalates through Kael's intrusion and Veyra's decisive activation of the amulet. Cost is legible on-page, and agency drives the tightening, though the confrontation is brief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance after loss emerges organically from Veyra's quest and the final image of silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the high-band cap applies due to Q2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, cosmic). Voice modulates under pressure, and dialogue is minimal but functional. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffolding; figurative language supports clarity and momentum. High-band cap applies due to Q2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal seeker, dimensional mutiny, and quiet acceptance feels fresh and organic. The risk of a lyric, open ending pays off with emotional specificity, though the premise is not fully transformative.</comment>
