<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's amoral philanthropy and secret sentimentality are concretely embodied through actions like the locked drawer and the drought project. His final choice to release the drought is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foregoing his creation, though some motivation is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: Elias's release of the drought reweights the echo's meaning, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via patterned imagery. The map and drought provide persistent constraints that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt flat and egg are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image with selective sensory detail ("crystalline crust," "sickly light"). Environment actively pressures the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in following the map and releasing the drought, tightening the stake under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page in his acceptance of being forgotten.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through loss emerges organically via the egg and drought, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer ("the echo would remain") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature; elision (e.g., the map's logic) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density, rhythmic control, and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("hummed with the ghost of a song") is consistent and clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of manufacturing a drought to preserve an echo is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
