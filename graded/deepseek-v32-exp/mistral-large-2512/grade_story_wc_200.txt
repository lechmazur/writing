<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Collector's burden and quiet rebellion are concretely embodied; interior contradictions (fear/fearlessness) act in scene; final gift is earned by engagement, with cost felt in the woman's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at dawn with legible cost (woman gone, tooth warm); orientation is immediate, causality clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is a vivid, pressure-laden environment; the crocodile tooth and harp are recurring objects that charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quest for laughter) escalates via collector's agency (approach, sit); cost is unmistakable (loss of the woman, gain of laughter) under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing through laughter emerges from concrete images and actions; ending offers resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; lyrical voice matches the collector's perception; dialogue is minimal but natural; no head‑hopping, and elision (harp notes) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clear, with varied rhythm and high information density; no loops or scaffold that obscure closure; figurative language is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sorrow and hope; the collector's quiet quest feels organic and inevitable; risk‑taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
