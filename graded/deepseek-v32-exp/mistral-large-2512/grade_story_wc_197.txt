<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her interiority is concrete and her final choice (pressing ENTER) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The "underestimated rebel" trait is shown through action, though some interior phrasing ("tyranny of indifference") edges toward theme statement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (broadcast) with felt cost (enforcers' arrival, risk of capture). Orientation is anchored early; the key and puddle map establish a clear because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting (auric lagoon, puddles, tunnel) is vividly specific and constrains choice (puddles guide, key fits hatch). The lagoon's glow recurs to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) escalates causally via Lira's agency; the enforcers' arrival tightens pressure, and the cost (risk, but success) is legible on the page at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and rewriting emerges through concrete events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("rewritten... and so was she") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice is poetic yet urgent, with perceptual signature (light, reflections). No head-hopping; dialogue (screen text) is integrated and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("liquid fire," "ghost of voices") is consistent and serves pressure; closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes via specific elements (phone booth key, puddle map); risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
