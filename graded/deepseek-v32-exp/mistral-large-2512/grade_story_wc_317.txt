<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and her motivation to safeguard innovation intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices (planting the seed, moving it inside) revealing her values. However, some emotional beats are told rather than fully embodied ("Her pulse quickened," "Lena’s stomach twisted"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise—turning off the lantern as the flower unfolds and the courier warns—with clear cost (imminent threat). Causal linkages hold, though the late father connection feels slightly convenient. Orientation is immediate; the hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and atmospheric, with the brook and storm-born silence recurring to charge the final image. The environment subtly guides choice (planting by the brook) and constrains tactics (moving inside, darkness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (planting, redesigning, locking door) under a hybrid lens, with stakes tightening from curiosity to personal threat. Cost is legible in the final darkness and unfolding bloom, though the vague "they" slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of growth in stillness and safeguarding innovation emerge organically through the seed's lore and Lena's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the blooming flower in darkness, though a line like "to safeguard space for innovation" states theme a bit explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is consistently atmospheric, with a lyrical texture filtering through Lena's perception. Minimal dialogue is natural; no head-hopping. Some exposition about her profession slightly distances, but control remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with good sensory detail. Minor clichés ("pulse quickened," "stomach twisted") and occasional expository phrasing ("orthogonal approaches") prevent a higher score, but no major artifacts or loops hinder closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed as a mystery gift is a fresh, specific synthesis, and the escape room designer's perspective adds originality. The quiet, charged ending takes a risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
