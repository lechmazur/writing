<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's dreamless immunity and curiosity create a credible internal contradiction; his final stance shift to guarding sparks is earned by the archive encounter with visible cost in expanded responsibility. Micro-choices under pressure are specific, though agency remains slightly passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final lines; causal lens holds tightly from touch to archive to return; orientation is immediate and the clock constraint shapes the entire turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glowing dune and archive are vividly sensory and indispensable, each constraining choice and charging the final image; the dune's hum and decay directly pressure Elias's steps and the clock's discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates from guarding cargo to guarding sparks via Elias's agency in touching the clock and receiving the mission; cost is legible in the conceptual burden assumed, tightening under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating sparks in a burnt world emerges from concrete images (forest, archive, clock) and resolves in a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through voice and object.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and perceptually distinct, with lyrical rhythm and controlled diction; the fractured-lullaby voice integrates seamlessly, and no head‑hopping or distance slips occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, and sentence‑level propulsion supports the atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of post‑apocalyptic freight guard, bioluminescent dune, and time‑archive concepts feels inevitable; risk‑taking in lyric‑speculative blend heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
