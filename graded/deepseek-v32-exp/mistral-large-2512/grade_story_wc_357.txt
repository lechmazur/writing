<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete with embodied emotion and clear motivation; Lira's final endurance is earned by prior causality. However, internal contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise with felt cost ("the fruit ripening in seconds, then bursting into seeds"); causal lens holds tightly, and the gravity inversion constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (arches, water flow); the floating rock arches and accelerant grove directly constrain action and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens; the impending gravity inversion tightens options, and cost is legible in the grove's transformation and Lira's realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as bending emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the seed‑burst without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (professional, tactile); voice modulates with pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language ("plucked string of a harp") is coherent and advances momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar tropes (orchard planet, gravity inversion) feels inevitable; specific world‑logic and risk‑taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
