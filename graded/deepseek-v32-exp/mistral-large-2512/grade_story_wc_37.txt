<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (trembling fingers, tight throat) and a micro-choice to plant the seed and sing. The final act is earned by prior causality, though her character remains archetypal, limiting higher-band distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure lands on-page with felt cost (raw throat, ongoing work) and a decisive change (dawn breaking). Orientation is immediate; the plot’s because/therefore linkage is seamless, and the keeper’s constraint (seed/songs) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the greenhouse provides the seed and knowledge; the mica window recurs to charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara’s urgency, elevating atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling dawns) escalates through Elara’s agency: she learns the method, then acts, with cost (voice raw, effort) legible. The tightening is causal and meaningful, foreclosing the option of inaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and hope emerges organically from concrete actions (planting, singing) and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through keeper’s gestures and the vines’ greeting, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical prose that reflects Elara’s perception. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (forgotten songs) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, and the final image lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest tropes through specific concepts (dawns as fruit, memory as song) that feel organic. Emotional truth and specificity elevate it, though the core premise remains familiar, limiting the highest band.</comment>
