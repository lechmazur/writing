<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete (trembling fingers, fogged glass). The final choice to activate the signal is earned by prior causality, and the cautious hope at the end feels credible. Minor slip: explanation of tricksters borders on diagnostic label-speak but is anchored in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost felt in "the weight of the night" and "wars yet to come." Causal lens holds: because/therefore linkages from detection to action to outcome. Orientation is immediate; constraint (tricksters' attunement to noise) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the radio station's tools (subsonic generator, charts, tower) constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (static, red lights, fogged glass). Environment pressures action and mirrors internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community fracturing) escalates through Mara's agency under causal lens. The activation of the subsonic signal is a decisive tightening with legible cost (temporary relief, ongoing war). Pressure coheres and reweights options at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (cunning over force) emerges organically through action and image, culminating in the resonant line "not by shouting, but by whispering." No moralizing; ambiguity persists. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (technical, atmospheric). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Minor register drift in explaining tricksters, but voice remains coherent under pressure and elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and serves closure. Information density is high; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere without artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and technical problem-solving. The subsonic solution is specific and indispensable. Risk-taking in quiet, intellectual resolution pays off with originality that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
