<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear motivation rooted in traits; interiority is concrete and emotions embodied in micro-choices like twitching toward the fragment. Final commitment to searching is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with charged poise (resonant reconfiguration) under accumulative lens; cost is legible in "The searching was the honoring." Orientation is immediate, and the fragment as persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory setting with selective detail; the lighthouse fragment as object constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test. Market and attic are woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring histories escalates through Liora's agency under accumulative lens; tightening from curiosity to retrieval carries conceptual cost in the ending, though cost is more felt than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of elusive stories emerges through particulars like the drowned lighthouse painting; subtext in images avoids moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature reflects Liora's translator mindset; rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping or opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language like "anchor" is consistent and clear; sentence propulsion supports accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intuition and retrieval through specific details like alchemist's market; transforms tropes with risk-taking in accumulative structure; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
