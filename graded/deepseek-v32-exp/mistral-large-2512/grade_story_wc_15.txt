<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation, though abstract, is consistently pursued through sensory engagement. The final choice to sew is earned by prior encounters with the needle and voice, though contradictory impulses are minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora integrates into the labyrinth's story. Orientation is clear early, but the cost of transformation is more implied than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (salt-stiffened air, bone needle) that constrain choice and charge the final image. The labyrinth itself acts as a micro-setting that pressures navigation and reveals the woven chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stake (ruin to reverence) is signaled early and tightens through discovered footprints, needle, and voice, leading to the loom. Agency is clear as Liora chooses to sew, foreclosing her prior uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining ruin into reverence emerges through concrete images (illustration plate, needle, tapestry) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the act of weaving memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third POV with a distinct poetic perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "the air shimmered like heat off a forge"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense, lyrical prose with high information density; figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. No repetitive loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth, weaving, and broken precedents through a specific character lens; the risk of lyrical accumulation pays off in a cohesive, inevitable-feeling closure.</comment>
