<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits (rebellious, plant-connected, driven by curiosity and a need to choose). Interiority is concrete (gnarled fingers, static-like prickling, dreams) and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (defying the Council, the world's rebirth). Minor hairline slip: her "purpose" at the climax is stated a touch abstractly, but the embodied preceding beats anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the embryo's essence seeps into the earth, the ground hums, the future unfolds like a kite—options and stakes are reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost (defiance, rebirth). Causal lens holds from kite discovery to deciphering to unsealing. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in the final image of the humming earth and the Council's impending arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are indispensable, constraining choice (off-limits location, site of the embryo) and charging the final image (steaming, humming). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sulfur scent, obsidian rock, mineral water). POV filter is strong (Mira's memorized cracks, the plants' whispers). Micro-setting (the kite, the amber) also participates in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (world's rebirth vs. Council's control) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: deciphering the kite leads to the unsealing, which forces the decisive change. Cost is legible in the trembling springs, the faded kite, and the imminent Council response. One meaningful tightening (the unsealing) is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (evolution vs. dogma, chosen rebirth) emerges from concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the humming earth and singing plants, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (Lina's wide eyes, Mira's smile). No moralizing; the final image carries the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (Mira's plant-whispering, time-mapped obsidian). Voice is lyrical yet grounded, modulating with pressure. Dialogue (minimal) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping. Purposeful elision (the exact decoding process) is taught and pays off in the unsealing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor figurative muddle in one peak beat ("the words coiled around her thoughts like the steam... insistent, undeniable") slightly blurs sense but does not harm closure. Otherwise, clean propulsion, varied syntax, and a powerful final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, elder protagonist, telepathic plants, and cryptic kite feels organic and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (the grandmother as insurgent, destiny as an embryo). The final reconfiguration (rebirth) grows from prior particulars and takes a bold, specific risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
