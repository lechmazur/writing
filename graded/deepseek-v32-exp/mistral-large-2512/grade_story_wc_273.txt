<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with consistent motivation and micro-choices under pressure; Elias's curiosity and wildness drive the plot. Some traits are told ("consciously wild") rather than fully shown, but his final resolve is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is causally tight with clear early orientation and a charged poise closure. The lens (causal) holds; the cost is legible in Elias's serene anger and the child's recovery, though the ink's abstraction slightly softens the tactile price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail that establishes atmosphere. However, the encampment does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood, capping the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to life-saving to conspiracy, driven by Elias's agency. The tightening when the ink forms a shape and Elias intervenes raises the cost, though the immediate resolution is swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of time and disappearance emerges naturally through images and events; the ending reweights prior material without moralizing. The final vow "he would not disappear" offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical third-person POV that remains consistent. The perceptual signature is sharp, and rhythmic modulation supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with varied rhythm and high information density. No significant artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and character under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (tracker, drone, disappearing ink) into a fresh, specific concept with emotional truth. The premise of stolen time feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
