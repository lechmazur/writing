<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied; his final choice to speak his name is earned by prior causality with visible cost (shattering lattice, fleeing). Interiority is concrete, but contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost (lattice shatters, beam reactivates, he runs); causal lens holds tightly from entry to climax; orientation is immediate and anchors who, where, when within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the lighthouse, lattice, and ledger constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. hush) escalate through Elias's agency; one meaningful tightening occurs when he speaks his name, forcing a trade-off with legible cost (shattering, flight). Coincidence does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence, lies, and legacy emerges through image and action; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (speaking breaks hush but chase continues) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct; voice has a lyrical, perceptual signature with controlled rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, especially in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes the "boy who cried wolf" myth with supernatural horror in a fresh, inevitable way; risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
