<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's chronic curiosity and memory-driven investigation are concrete and compel his return, with embodied emotion in the climax. However, contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene; his final choice is earned but lacks internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final fading image. Star-pattern detection slightly convenient but tightly integrated; orientation is clear and transitions are smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (wading, touching earth); the fairy ring and sunken greenhouse charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects urgency and POV bias, though some description borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) escalates through Elias's agency—studying stars, returning, touching the ring—culminating in a legible cost (Liora's loss, greenhouse collapse). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges through concrete images; final mushroom cap offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the fairy ring as doorway enriches without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice modulates from crisp nostalgia to eerie pressure. Brief dialogue is natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, though minor overwriting ("silent sentinels") and a cliché occur. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is mostly controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore, celestial mapping, and memory loss feels organic; fairy ring as map is non-obvious. Emotional truth of sibling loss grounds the supernatural premise.</comment>
