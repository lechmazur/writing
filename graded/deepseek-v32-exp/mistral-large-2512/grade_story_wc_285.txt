<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices (mending) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis (serenity) is motivated by prior reflection and action, though the emotional progression is subtle and the cost of his endurance is felt more conceptually than viscerally on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with clear cost legible in the final image of weightlessness contrasted against years of burden. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through POV. The fog-bound river and yarn needle function as micro-settings that directly pressure choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting evolves with the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe crossing/maintaining the ferry) is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the Accumulative lens via the storm's intensification. Protagonist agency (mending, rowing) drives the resolution. Cost is legible, though the external threat remains atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (layers of loss, finding essence) emerges organically from concrete particulars (rope, needle, storm). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of serenity. The explicit mention of "palimpsest promise" is slightly on-the-nose but is anchored in character thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply focalized; voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyric compression is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction and syntax consistently reflect the character's contemplative, weathered consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propelled with high information density. No loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor register drift in phrases like "palimpsest promise" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mundane task with profound internal reflection feels organic and inevitable. Specific, verifiable details (yarn needle, ambient awareness) transform a familiar archetype. The quiet, introspective risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
