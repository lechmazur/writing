<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward's characterization is concrete and embodied; his core trait of turning obstacles into instruments is dramatized through micro-choices (dubbing the driftwood) and culminates in a credible, earned shift from interpreter to collaborator. Interiority is filtered through sensory perception ("salt in his veins") without diagnostic label-speak. The final choice—actively conducting the sea—is motivated by prior causality and carries the cost of reconfigured relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is cleanly inferred and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the world becomes a collaborator; cost is legible in the final image ("his chest ached with the beauty of it"). Orientation is immediate, pattern taught early. No causality breaks; the structure builds density toward a single, meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not just vivid but actively constrains and enables the central action—the raft "shivered, then sang" under Leeward's mallet, making the setting a key instrument. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and POV-filtered ("fruit that tasted of brine and stubbornness"). The environment decisively charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and atmospheric—Leeward's desire to harmonize with, rather than merely read, the sea. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a clean density increase: from observation to tentative dubbing to full symphonic collaboration. The protagonist's agency drives each step, and the cost is the beautiful, aching weight of being heard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core action: obstacles become instruments, interpretation becomes collaboration. Subtext is rich in the transformation of clouds from omens to "collaborators." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the world "singing back," reweighting the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and masterfully controlled. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, attuned to resonance and fracture. Poetic compression is taught and paid off ("the blue hour was his now"). Syntax and rhythm modulate perfectly with the building pressure, achieving a rare synthesis of style and substance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and musical, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-driven ("the clouds were his score"). Rhythm accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. No artifacts obscure closure; the final beat lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—a floating orchard, a tide prophet using resonance to fractal-generate harmony with the sea—is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of high-lyric abstraction is fully earned by concrete, tactile detail and a coherent emotional arc. The premise is transformed through specific, lived-in particularity.</comment>
