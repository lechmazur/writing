<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's attentive mysticism is concretely embodied through frost study and prism use; his shift from seeking proof to accepting communion is earned by the memory of the man's grief. Interior contradiction (belief vs. doubt) is present but quiet; final renunciation carries cost via the melted frost image. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is credible for the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("truth was never pure") with legible cost in the melted frost and shifted hush. Accumulative lens holds: details (frost, prism, quartz) accumulate to reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words; mosaic of present and memory shards is taught and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail (cold air, crystalline branches, dendritic frost) is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (car window) functions as environment that shapes discovery. No generic placeholder or momentum stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof objects absorb emotions) escalates via accumulative density: frost pattern discovery and memory of the man's grief deepen understanding. Agency in communion (pressing palm, focusing) leads to realization with cost: relinquishment of pure proof for nuanced truth. No coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: prism bends light, frost whispers riddles, quartz transforms sorrow. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "truthful lies" and shifted hush. Avoids moralizing; subtext operates in silence and implication. Epiphany earned by specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct lyrical, attentive voice. Perceptual signature is strong (fracturing light, frost patterns). No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and close. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats (breath hitched, numb fingers). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("spectral shards," "truthful lies") is consistent and voice-motivated. Sentence variety supports accumulative rhythm. No artifact obscures causality or closure; proofreading is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical inquiry with emotional residue concept feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, introspective plot heightens stakes. Specific details (quartz arbor, frost patterns) are irreplaceable. No derivative template; transformation through lived detail.</comment>
