<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Miss Voss’s interiority is concrete and her patient determination is embodied in micro-choices (ignoring Maren, persisting with the zither). The choir’s gradual change feels earned, though her internal contradictions are subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost (“her throat tight”). Causal lens holds: the zither’s introduction triggers a because/therefore chain across rehearsals, culminating in harmony and hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn leaves are woven into action and mood; the zither functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, its mother-of-pearl rosette a tactile anchor for change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unifying the choir) escalates through Miss Voss’s agency—the zither, her persistence—and tightens across rehearsals. Cost is legible in the final harmony and her tight throat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning hatred emerges through specific images and gestures, but the final line (“teach them to listen”) borders on thematic statement, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Miss Voss’s lyrical perception. Voice is distinct, with rhythmic control and no head‑hopping; elision of rehearsals is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“like ice over a pond”) serves pressure; closure image is crisp and cost‑laden.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The familiar “choir heals” premise is transformed by the zither’s specific role and the concept of “vanishing arts.” Synthesis feels inevitable, risk‑taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes.</comment>
