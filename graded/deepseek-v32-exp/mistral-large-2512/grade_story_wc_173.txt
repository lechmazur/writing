<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied and micro-choices reveal values. The final renunciation of fear is earned by the thread-unraveling causality, with visible cost in her prior silence. Slight poetic abstraction doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise reconfiguration (finding her voice) with cost legible in the unraveled threads and gathered echoes. Orientation is immediate, causality clean, and the sanctuary's purpose fulfilled anchors the change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (the sanctuary must be unlocked) and charges the final image (courtyard as mirror). Sensory detail is selective and woven through action, with the prism walls and snow deepening atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying conformity) escalates via Liora's agency in untangling threads and harvesting echoes; cost is visible in overcoming the black thread's weight. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens reweights options at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (threads, echoes) without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to silence vs. voice. Subtext in gesture and memory reweights prior material, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "between sigh and smile") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in phrases like "bodily poetic grace" doesn't harm clarity at closure; figurative language serves atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan and echo-harvesting feels inevitable; poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in thread symbolism and sanctuary use transforms familiar tropes through grounded detail.</comment>
