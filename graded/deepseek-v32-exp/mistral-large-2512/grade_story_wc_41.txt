<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority and consistent traits; the prophet's forgetfulness is both flaw and driver. The final determination is earned by the tape's revelation, with visible cost in the cyclical struggle. Slight passivity when receiving the woman's instruction limits agency at the midpoint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear orientation and accumulative lens; closure lands with charged poise as the fog lifts and he steps forward. Cost is legible in the woman's sadness and the tape's message. Ritual causality is tight and the tape reconfigures the quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice; fog, driftwood, and chalk are tactile and charged, culminating in the parting fog that reveals the path, directly shaping the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing time escalates through the driftwood ritual and the woman's condition; the tape deepens the stake and the cost of cyclical forgetting is felt. Agency is clear in completing the spiral and accepting the tape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time emerges through concrete images; the final message ("silence between heartbeats") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the quest with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with lyrical, textured prose; the prophet's perceptual signature is distinct, and voice modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Polished sentences with high density and rhythmic control; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Propulsion is maintained through varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic forgetfulness and mystical ritual in a junkyard setting; specific details (chalk, driftwood, videotape) create inevitability and emotional truth. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
