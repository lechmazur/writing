<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied; her motivation to understand transformation drives micro-choices under pressure. The final surrender is earned by prior causality—her struggle between control and release—with visible cost in her released tension. No stock phrasing; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because she notices the sapling's change, she investigates; because she touches it, it responds; therefore she lets go. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (surrendering control) on-page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; structure is a single continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposeful—damp earth, storm, trellis—filtered through Mara's professional gaze. The sapling and leaf function as micro-setting that constrain choice and charge the final image with iridescent transformation. Sensory detail mirrors internal upheaval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. control) escalates through Mara's agency: observation → touch → release. One meaningful tightening (letting go) forecloses her path of reconstruction with cost legible in her knelt surrender. Pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through surrender emerges from particulars—sapling's metamorphosis, leaf as invitation—without moralizing. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: letting go invites deeper change. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (third-person limited) is stable with distinct perceptual signature: Mara's plant‑expertise filters observation. Voice is poetic yet precise, rhythmic under pressure. No head‑hopping; elision (old texts) is anchored and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("circuitously sincere") is voice‑motivated and consistent. Information density high; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism and botanical precision feels inevitable. Risk‑taking in reluctant metamorphosis heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, grounded details (linden leaf, grandmother's texts) anchor originality.</comment>
