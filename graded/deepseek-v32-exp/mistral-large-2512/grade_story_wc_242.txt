<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with a clear motivation of cultivated estrangement. Her micro-choices (listening, not correcting) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The final doubt ("wondered if she had done enough") introduces a subtle internal conflict, but the characterization remains slightly static, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, building pattern of callers to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with felt cost in the final sentence: "wondered if she had done enough." Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the disc shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, filtered through Mara's perception. The glass harmonica disc, a recurring object, decisively charges the final image and constrains her actions (pressing it, listening). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, deeply integrated with character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Mara's role as listener is signaled early and reweighted through the accumulative pattern of caller resolutions. Escalation is driven by external events (the woman's readiness, the boy's disappearance) that deepen Mara's internal doubt. Cost is legible in her final questioning, though agency is more reactive than active.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of estrangement, witness, and the weight of unresolved endings emerges organically through concrete particulars (the disc, wrong numbers, looping calls). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, recharging prior material through the disc's silent melody and Mara's doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a stable third-person limited POV. Rhythmic prose and perceptual signature (e.g., "cultivated estrangement," "melodically haunted") heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and lyrical rhythm with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("thin as a whisper," "melodically haunted") is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative pattern, and the final beat is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing the underground operator, wrong-number friendships, and the glass harmonica disc into an inevitable, non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels earned and authentic.</comment>
