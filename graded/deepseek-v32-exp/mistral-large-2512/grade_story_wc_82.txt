<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra's grief and cleverness are concretely embodied; her micro-choices under pressure (climbing, selecting dreams, making lanterns) culminate in an earned transformation with visible cost when the dream enters her. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final reconfiguration is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure lands on-page with undeniable cost ("the world transformed"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of grief and dreams shapes tactics leading to the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden) is vividly specific and constrains choice; the lanterns and origami cranes charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Veyra's POV, reinforcing the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing grief) escalates through Veyra's agency as lanterns feed and shatter, tightening options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible when the dream coils into her, foreclosing her prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through concrete images (cranes, lanterns, dreams) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting via the world's transformation, deepening prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Veyra's craft and grief. Rhythmic control heightens pressure, and any elision (e.g., shadow's detachment) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with no scaffold loops or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the beat. Information density is high, and the final image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording, grief-processing, and world-transformation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
