<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Liora's embodied curiosity and micro-choices under pressure create a compelling arc; the final, costly decision to ring the bell is earned by prior causality and a visible near-failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, causal linkages tighten cleanly, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost—the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary and bell rope are not merely vivid but constrain choice and charge the climax; sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through expert POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates under causal pressure; the reversal when the storm "changes its mind" forces a costly, agentive choice that demonstrates consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The listening vs. noise theme emerges organically from action and image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that deepens on reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, perceptive voice that reflects Liora's expertise; rhythmic control supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished, dense prose with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language enhances without muddling, and peak beats are clear and propelled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of the storm-watcher archetype through specific character choices and a quiet, earned twist; the combination feels inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
