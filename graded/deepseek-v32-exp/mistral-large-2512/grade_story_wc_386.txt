<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation as a “salvager of echoes” is clear and intensifies, driving methodical investigation and a final renunciation. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., breath fogging icy walls), and the choice to keep silent is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the burden of truth. Contradictory impulses (seeking purity versus accepting ruin) act in scene, and the ending’s Earned Stasis feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: snow globe → dream → investigation → discovery → final charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in “She would never tell. Some wrecks were meant to stay buried.” Orientation is immediate, and the structure’s two-shard design (shrine, investigation, return) maintains pressure without a break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purpose-driven—the glacier shrine and melted snow globe constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (residual warmth, ice groaning) reflect POV bias and urgency. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting that evolves and directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging something pure) is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s agency: dream analysis tightens options, revealing sabotage. The cost is unmistakable in her renunciation and the ghost’s final appearance. One meaningful tightening (discovery of sabotage) forecloses her initial path with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truth, silence, buried history) emerges organically through images and events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via the snow globe’s tear‑like drop and Mara’s decision. Subtext operates in the ghost’s sad smile and the line “Ask the ones who lived,” embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature (“salvager of echoes,” “windows of connection”). Voice modulates with emotional intensity yet remains coherent under pressure. Dialogue (ghost’s two lines) is natural and carries subtext, advancing the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats (e.g., “truth woven carefully into her bones”). Sentence‑level propulsion accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and the final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost‑story, mystery, and moral dilemma feels fresh and inevitable. The melted snow globe as a window of connection and the twist of sabotage (not accident) are non‑obvious and grounded in character. Risk‑taking in the quiet, reflective ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image reweights all prior material.</comment>
