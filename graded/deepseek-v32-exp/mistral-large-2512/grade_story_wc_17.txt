<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in paternal legacy, with concrete interiority (e.g., fingers brushing brittle diary edges). His final choice—reaching toward the map—is earned by prior causality, though his "sensitively perceptive nature" is stated rather than fully embodied in micro-choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: diaries lead to film negative, which leads to the woman and map. Closure is a Charged Poise (CR) where Elias understands the warning; cost is legible in the "walls hummed in anticipation," reconfiguring the premise with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choice (ducking beneath ivy, feeling the wall's feverish warmth). The ivy-veiled passage and the map-etched floor charge the final image. Minor deduction: the climate shift backdrop is noted but doesn't concretely constrain tactics within the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling the father's mystery) escalate through discovered clues to a face-to-face revelation. Agency drives each step; the cost is felt in the burden Elias accepts. A slight softening: the woman’s exposition resolves the mystery a bit neatly, slightly reducing the tension of the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and memory emerges organically from the father's question and the walls' remembering. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction: the woman's line, "The walls don’t just dream. They remember," articulates the theme a bit explicitly, slightly reducing subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elias's perceptive, anxious consciousness. Voice is distinct, lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic propulsion ("The air hummed with the weight of something unseen"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and atmospheric with strong information density. Occasional overwriting ("veins of a forgotten god") leans slightly purple but doesn't obscure causality. No repetitive loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports momentum through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—walls that remember and a cartographer of echoes—is fresh and well-integrated. The synthesis of legacy, climate shifts, and mystical geography feels organic. Slight familiarity in the "last cartographer" trope prevents a higher score, but execution is specific and transformative.</comment>
