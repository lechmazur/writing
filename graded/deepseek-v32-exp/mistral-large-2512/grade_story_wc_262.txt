<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait as a crystal gazer; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. However, internal contradiction is minimal—her determination is steady, lacking contradictory impulses in scene—and the cost of the film blackening is light, though the final choice to reach for the pen is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (film strip blackening); causal lens holds tightly from her psychometry to the projector's activation. Orientation is anchored early, and structure is a single, coherent scene fitting the length. Persistent constraint from the film strip shapes tactics, but the cost is not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtering through Mira's POV. The film strip functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image when it projects lyrics, satisfying the 9+ test for object-as-setting constraining choice or charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love/tune) is signaled early; escalation via Mira's agency under causal lens (touch leads to vision leads to projection). Cost is legible in the film blackening, but the stakes remain abstract and the price is light, limiting higher-band impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory and unsent emotion emerges through concrete images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the song was always there—without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, but the theme is slightly overt in the lyric question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, space-attuned); voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "hushed thunder," and rhythmic control is evident. No head-hopping or experimental elision that obscures closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently, with purposeful figurative language, e.g., "like a heart in hibernation."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry and vintage film lore feels organic; details are specific to this voice and setting. The concept is transformed through grounded choices, though risk-taking is moderate and the premise is not radically innovative.</comment>
