<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liora's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, but her ghostly nature limits embodied emotion and internal contradiction; her final fade is earned but lacks visible cost, keeping the characterization strong but not deeply flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear orientation and closure; Liora's disappearance and the orchard's revival form a decisive change with gentle cost, though the resolution is neat without significant constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail creates a lush atmosphere; the floating arches and nebula actively shape the villagers' choices and charge the final image with resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard's survival) escalates through Liora's messages and villager response; cost is legible in her fading, but pressure remains gentle without sharp trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship emerges organically through imagery and action; the final message slightly explicates but avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice is consistent and poetic, but mild head-hopping into villager perspectives slightly blurs focalization; otherwise clean and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise, rhythmic, and vivid with high information density; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language supports clarity and momentum throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly guide and sci-fi orchard setting feels organic; the concept is transformed through specific, grounded details, though the emotional arc remains familiar.</comment>
