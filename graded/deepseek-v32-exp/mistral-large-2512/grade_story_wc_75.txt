<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with concrete interiority (flour dust, dream). Her micro-choice to bake bread reveals values under pressure. However, the dream's overt symbolism ("the loaf spoke") and the rapid thawing of dread after the bees return slightly undercut the earned struggle. The final choice is credible but the emotional resolution feels somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details (loom, bread, bees) build to a Resonant Reconfiguration (bees return, tapestry moves) with a felt cost (rosewater dread thaws). Orientation is immediate. Closure lands on-page with a clear before/after shift. The magical cause-effect (bread to bees) is a pattern break that fits the lens, but the linkage is slightly soft, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV (wet moss, old paper, damp rock). The grotto and bakery function as micro-settings that pressure choice (cold ovens). The opera glass and loom are recurring objects that charge the final image. However, the setting's role in constraining tactics is more atmospheric than actively limiting, holding it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing dying arts) is clear early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a single decisive intensification: baking the bread reweights the stake and triggers the bees' return. Agency is present, but the cost is primarily emotional and resolves quickly. The magical resolution, while fitting, slightly diminishes the sense of hard-won trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation emerges organically from particulars (tapestry, bread, bees). Subtext operates in gesture and image (the warm opera glass, the moving threads). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, Orlan's line "displacement took it away" edges toward thematic statement, and the resolution leans slightly toward hopeful neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinctive, with a poetic, sensory perceptual signature ("voice like aged parchment"). Diction is controlled and voice-modulated. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture, though a few phrases risk preciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Figurative language is generally purposeful and coherent. No loops or scaffold artifacts. A minor note: "rosewater dread" is a striking coinage but its single use makes it slightly decorative. Overall, line-level craft is polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of displaced persons, dying arts, and magical realism feels fresh and specific. The grotto setting and bee motif are transformed through grounded, emotional particulars. The closure reconfigures the premise with a risk of hopeful magic that largely pays off. A slight conventionality in the "lost tradition revived" arc prevents the highest originality tier.</comment>
