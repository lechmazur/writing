<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's cautious interiority and embodied reactions (fingers tightening, breath catching) under pressure are precise; her final choice to listen with Mira is earned by the seal-triggered revelation. Mira's revelation as Veyra's daughter provides a credible shift in relationship status. Contradictory impulses are present but quiet, limiting the score just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: the seal recognition forces Mira's disclosure and reconfigures their shared purpose. Closure is a Charged Poise—"let's listen"—with palpable cost ("weight of the past finally lifting"). The persistent constraint of the seal shapes tactics and the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower create a vivid, intimate atmosphere, but the antique desk seal functions as micro-setting: it constrains choice (triggers the revelation) and decisively charges the final image of shared legacy, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Veyra's legacy) escalates through Mira's recognition of the seal and her disclosure. Elara's agency in revealing the seal and choosing to listen with Mira narrows options and reweights the cost—the lifting weight of secrecy—legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy, secrecy, and communal truth emerges through concrete particulars (seal, weekly tea, language of stone). The ending’s resonant, non-literal answer—"let’s listen"—reweights prior material without moralizing, earning its emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara) is stable and filtered through her perceptual bias; dialogue carries subtext and natural rhythm. Voice remains distinct and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the agreed-upon lie) paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; figurative language ("whisper of falling stars," "dust of the stars") is selective and pattern-taught. Sentences vary rhythmically, advancing character and atmosphere with zero loops or scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a language of architecture, a hidden legacy, and an "agreed-upon lie" feels organic and inevitable. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded character choices and a risk-taking quiet climax that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
