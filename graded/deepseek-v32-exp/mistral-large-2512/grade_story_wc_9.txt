<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradiction in "willingly perplexed" drives devotion; final acceptance earned through ritual with visible cost in "choking beauty."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image; orientation clear early, pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; micro-setting (cracked saucer, cloth) constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (finding lost time) escalate via density increase under accumulative lens; agency in tracing crack and aligning handprints leads to cost legible in the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery and action; ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; subtext in silence and repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV stable and close; voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language consistent and purposeful; closure image clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartomancy and memory; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes; specificity feels inevitable and indispensable.</comment>
