<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied; her contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. personal empathy) drive a micro-choice (reaching for Kael's hand) that earns the final renunciation with visible cost—the shared grief that lightens both their burdens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (Kael leaves) and Resonant Reconfiguration (pavilion warms) with on-page cost in the shared memory weight and the coral's pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and constrains choice: the coral pavilion functions as both crucible and charged final image. Sensory detail (taste of rain, smooth coral) reflects POV bias and mirrors internal thawing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will Kael be consumed by grief?) tightens through Maren's agency—touch and dialogue—under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the syrupy remorse she swallows and the lighter memories after sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief as tide, not monument) emerges through concrete images (tidal pools, frozen coral) and the final, non-literal promise. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven; psychic distance shifts intentionally to deepen emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("stored remorse, thick as syrup") is consistent and heightens pressure without muddle; sentence variety supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and emotional specificity feels inevitable. The contagious grief premise is transformed through grounded character choices, and the final image recharges prior particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
