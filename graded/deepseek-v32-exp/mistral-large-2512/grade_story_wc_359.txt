<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (flinching, trembling). However, internal contradiction is minimal; her determination is unwavering, lacking the flawed complexity that would elevate the score further. The final success feels earned but the cost is mild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly; orientation is immediate. Closure lands with a decisive change (music released, chisel silenced) and resonant reconfiguration (wonder certified). Cost is legible in Eira's struggle, though not deeply felt. The sculptor's chisel provides a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral: the ice cavern's "sculpted hush" and the aurora's colors actively constrain and enable Eira's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image where the aurora merges into a beam to release the music.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (releasing the music to certify wonder) escalates through three chisel disruptions, each tightening pressure and demanding Eira's agency. However, the abstract nature of "wonder" and the mild cost keep the tension from reaching higher intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (music as a reminder of wonder's necessity). Slight deduction for the explicit statement "to certify wonder as essential," which edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Eira's synesthetic perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is lyrical yet controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; prose rhythm modulates effectively with the beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid imagery and varied syntax, advancing momentum. Some decorative flourishes ("quiet so deep it felt like a living thing") border on cliché, but no loops or scaffolds obscure causality. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, bell ringing, and aurora-based magic feels fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to and integrated, though it leans on familiar fantasy tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
