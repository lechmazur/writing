<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation and interiority; frugality as encrypted devotion is consistent. Final acceptance earned by prior choices. Minor tell in "he understood then" but closure choice remains credible with visible cost (tile dissolved, shard left).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change (understanding reoriented from binding to preserving) with cost legible in the tile's dissolution and the mercenaries' approach. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting pressures choice (palace between regimes) and charges the final image (oculus, star-mirror). Sensory detail selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Micro-setting (tile) constrains action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (covenant with unknown) tightens via tile's transformation and approaching mercenaries. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (uncloaking, dialogue). Cost visible in tile's loss and reconfigured purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge preservation emerges through particulars (tile, frugality, vision). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: covenant is with the future. No moralizing; subtext in dialogue and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (astronomer's bias). Poetic, measured rhythm under pressure. Dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("sandals whispered," "dusky harmony") is voice-motivated and precise. Syntax varies; propulsion maintained through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient astronomer and magic square with a non-obvious turn (preservation over binding). Emotional specificity in frugality as devotion. Risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
