<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. persistent curiosity) are embodied in scene; her final choice to embrace the dead’s call is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the mist recoils, but the chorus of need remains, charging her smile with acceptance of risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly; closure is a Charged Poise (resonant reconfiguration) where Lena’s smile crystallizes her role amid the dead, with cost legible in the “chorus of need.” The hearing aid’s constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere (mist, glass ceiling, marble) is filtered through Lena’s perception and actively pressures choices; the hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image when the mist recoils.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lena’s agency: she tracks pulses, confronts Elias, then runs toward Miriam despite warning. A single meaningful tightening—the warning and her choice to proceed—reweights stakes with cost felt in the closing chorus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening to the unheard emerges through particulars (photograph, hearing aid, voices); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Lena’s smile reconfigures her duty without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice; dialogue (Elias’s static-rasp) is natural and goal-driven; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with zero scaffold or loops; figurative language (“raindrop a whisper”) is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, accelerating into the climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-tracing with intimate, psychological stakes; the “contact tracer for hearts” concept is transformed through specific lived detail and a quiet, charged closure that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
