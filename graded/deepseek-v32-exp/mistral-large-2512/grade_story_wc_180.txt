<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion (e.g., ribbon frayed from anxious twisting); the girl's feistiness is shown through action and dialogue. The final exchange of wisdom is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation clear within first paragraph; single-scene accumulative design holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the final peach image and the reweighting of vows and persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral—the orchard-cathedral constrains choice (girl appears from branches) and charges the final image. Sensory details (pollen, damp earth, taste of peach) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) escalates through the interaction; Liora's agency (mending, wisdom) tightens under accumulative pressure. Cost is felt in her hesitation and the girl's loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (orchard, mending, ribbons) with subtext in dialogue ("It'll remind you that you already are"). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; third-person limited POV stable with a perceptual signature that filters through Liora's profession and history. Dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, varied rhythm, and no scaffold or loop artifacts. Figurative language ("deciduous vows") is consistent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quartz-eye mender, orchard-cathedral, and deciduous vows feels organic and inevitable. Emotional truth is specific, and the final reconfiguration earns its insight.</comment>
