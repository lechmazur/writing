<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently motivated, with embodied reactions and micro-choices under pressure, though his internal contradictions are mild and the stranger remains functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a Charged Poise with legible cost (government cover-up) and a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly filtered through POV, constrains action (respirator, spongy soil), and charges the final revelation of the healing clearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. lies) escalate via protagonist agency; stranger’s arrival tightens options, and the diamond’s use carries clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (orchard, diamond, letters); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature; prose texture is controlled, dialogue minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with varied syntax and no noticeable loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic mystery and ecological hope; the stillpoint and diamond-as-lens feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
