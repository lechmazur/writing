<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in her occupation, with interior contradiction and embodied emotion. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible in her hollowed-out feeling. No significant weaknesses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a charged poise with felt cost. Orientation is early and clear, and the persistent constraint of the thread shapes the final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the garden and thread charging the final image. The environment and object constrain choice and resonate through the closure. No flaws in consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is healing and absence, escalating through Lena's agency in burying the thread. Cost is legible in her hollowed state and the final image. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges subtly through imagery and action, with subtext in the thread and obituaries. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control supports pressure, and no head-hopping or dialogue issues. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformed through specific details like the thread and obituaries. Synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in quiet reflection heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
