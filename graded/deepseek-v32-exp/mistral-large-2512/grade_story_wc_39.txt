<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradictions (fleeing words yet capturing echoes) are embodied in micro-choices; his final renunciation of mere nuisance status for translator role is earned by jar-capturing beats with cost of loneliness visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where "maybe, just maybe, that was enough" reweights purpose with felt cost; orientation anchored by line 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Loft and dunes pressure isolation and supply jars; music box and jars constrain choices (capturing sounds) and charge the final image of lined-up "chorus of ghosts."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding purpose) escalates via agency: failing, then succeeding with jars, then sharing with girl; cost is legible in his years of rejection and hollow peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of gleaning redemption from echoes emerges through particulars (music box, jars, girl's visit); ending reconfirms without moralizing, offering resonant "translator" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (poet's eye for fragile details); voice modulates from wistful to warm under pressure; dialogue advances realization naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with controlled rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("like a breath held too long") serves atmosphere without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound-jar concept transforms vagrant-poet trope through specific, grounded choices; synthesis feels inevitable; risk of quiet internal arc heightens stakes.</comment>
