<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's elective exile and deep connection to the tides are embodied through concrete micro-choices; her decision to tattoo the man is motivated by the moonstone's pulse and her longing to break silence, culminating in a credible earned stasis (exiles together) with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she no longer feels alone, with cost legible in the shared criminality and the moonstone's final stillness. Single-scene structure tightens cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (the garden hosts the dance and the tattooing). The twilight garden, sea breeze, and star gaps are filtered through Liora's perception and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic expression vs. ban) escalates through Liora's agency in agreeing to tattoo; cost is legible in the risk of skinning and the reconfiguration of her exile. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory, art, and exile emerges through particulars (moonstone, tattooing) without statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through shared exile and the wind's scent, reweighting prior silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "gaps between the stars"). Voice modulates with pressure; dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. High information density; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Closure image is sharp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tide dancer, nostalgia ban, and constellation tattooist feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, grounded choices avoid template plots.</comment>
