<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirien’s motivation—wonder over greed—is clear and drives her risky trade. Her final realization ("not an object, but a question") is an earned conceptual shift rooted in prior causality (the guardian's cryptic warning). However, a slight diagnostic note enters her peak beat: "Lirien realized then..." introduces a mild label-speak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens holds, building through atmospheric pressure and the ritualistic trade to a resonant Conceptual Repricing (the sundial lid as question). Closure lands with legible cost: the "wrong sky" now feels like an "invitation," reweighting her premise. The guardian’s dialogue ("time is not what you seek") verges on exposition but serves the CR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric and purposeful ("frost-slicked steps," "wrong sky"). The spire and the lid pressure choice (the trade, the final warmth). However, the environment doesn't *actively* constrain tactics beyond providing a stage; the chess-piece trade could occur elsewhere, preventing the highest score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirien's agency (initiating the trade) under an accumulative lens, tightening through the guardian's reveal and the lid's transformation. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of her quest from relic to question. The stake (wonder) deepens meaningfully, though the pressure point is a single, dialogue-heavy exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (embracing the unknown) emerges impeccably through action and image, avoiding statement. The final line ("the next wrong sky to explore") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey. The lid’s transformation from object to question is a masterful thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("wrongness of the sky," "sacredly playful energy"). Voice modulates well with pressure. The guardian's dialogue is slightly more ornate but fittingly otherworldly. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vividly textured with strong rhythmic control. A minor figurative muddle appears: "shadow where no light should cast one" is logically contradictory. Some phrasing ("sacredly playful," "cosmic joke") leans ornamental but remains voice-consistent. Overall, high density without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of thief, cosmic relic, and conceptual trade feels fresh and organic. The core concept (apprentice of wonder) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in Lirien's amended philosophy ("embrace... but do it while running"). The ending's reconfiguration feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
