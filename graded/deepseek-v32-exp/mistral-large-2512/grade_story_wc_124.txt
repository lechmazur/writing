<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction between avoidance and seeking is embodied in concrete actions like flinching at citrus yet uncorking the vial. His final choice to keep the vial as a "whisper" is earned through the encounter, with cost felt in the "weight in his chest shifting." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Elias's stance shifts from wound to whisper) with on-page cost in the chest weight and steadying lantern. Orientation is anchored within first paragraph; the woman's entrance deepens pressure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting pressures choice via its role as a place "for those who can't let go," and the ultraviolet lamps charge the final image with "colors that didn’t exist." Sensory detail (damp earth, fogged glass, hum of lamps) is selective and filtered through Elias's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates through Elias's agency in engaging the woman, leading to a deepening that reweights options. Cost is legible in the tear and "weight shifting" under accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as something carried emerges through particulars like the vial and lantern metaphor, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Some things could only be understood in the dark." No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "scent of memory," "liquid twilight"). Voice modulates with emotional pressure without head-hopping; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext like "Grief isn’t something you fix."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("crystal shadows," "ghosts of blooms") is consistent and voice-motivated; sentence propulsion aligns with scene needs, especially in the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lantern broker, scent memory, and ultraviolet revelation feels inevitable. Tropes transformed through specific grounded choices; risk-taking with lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
