<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her resourcefulness is shown through micro-choices (negotiating, using the diary). The time traveler's desperation applies pressure, though his interiority is thinner. The sister's transformed state at closure carries a felt cost, making the final realization earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; causality is tight with a because/therefore chain leading to a decisive change. Closure lands on-page with cost (the sister aged, ink-stained) and a resonant reconfiguration ("lessons...never meant to be learned alone"). The shifting shelves and diary act as persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain is vividly specific and constrains choices (shifting shelves force navigation). Sensory details (scent of aged paper, groaning shelves) are filtered through Elara's expertise. The setting charges the final image and is indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find sister) is signaled early and escalates through negotiation and navigation. The door scene tightens pressure with a warning; Elara's agency (pushing it open) leads to a cost legible in the sister's transformation. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons and companionship emerges from the library concept and the sister's fate, not statement. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sister's ink-stained hands and the time traveler's fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct linguistic perceptiveness (noticing "gaps," shifting titles). Dialogue is tense and goal-driven. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (the library's rules) is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and vivid, coherent imagery (e.g., "spines of books," "off-key note"). High information density; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language supports momentum without muddle, especially in peak beats like the door opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arcane linguistics, time travel, and a bookstore mountain feels organic and inevitable. The concept commits fully, and the ending transforms the premise through specific, charged detail (the sister's drawing, the diary). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
