<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, interiority concrete via sensory perception and craft. However, lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict, and the final success feels earned but without visible cost to the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with the grove no longer silent. Cost is conceptual (breaking silence) but not explicitly felt on-page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the grove, sculpture, and insulator actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Capped due to high-band entry gate (Q2 < 8.8).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating music) is clear and escalates through protagonist agency; the insulator's use tightens options. Cost is implied but not unmistakably visceral, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of finding music in brokenness emerges organically from action and image; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer. Capped due to high-band entry gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature and lyrical, rhythmically controlled prose; no head-hopping. Capped due to high-band entry gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, figurative, and purposeful with no obvious loops or scaffold; rhythm supports the quiet tone. Capped due to high-band entry gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a silent world, tree-song sculptor, and resonant objects feels organic and inevitable; specific details anchor the premise. Capped due to high-band entry gate.</comment>
