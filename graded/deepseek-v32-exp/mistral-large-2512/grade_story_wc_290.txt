<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied emotion; claustrophobia is shown and later forgotten, marking a change. However, internal conflict is minimal during the key choice, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly causal with clear orientation and a decisive closure. The revelation that the Nexus is a ship lands with cost ("once you see the truth, you can’t unsee it"). The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and integral to the plot. Sensory details are selective and purposeful. The final image of the stars as a map charges the setting, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through protagonist agency. The choice to take the compass leads to a revelation with a warned cost. One meaningful tightening from seeking to understanding suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of freedom vs. confinement emerges through imagery and dialogue. The figure’s statement is slightly explicit, but the final image (stars as a map) offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature. POV is stable third-person limited, filtering the world through Elias’s sensations and emotions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and supports the atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of spatial mutiny and a dimensional ship is fresh and well-integrated. The twist feels inevitable in hindsight, and the combination of claustrophobia and cosmic freedom is memorable.</comment>
