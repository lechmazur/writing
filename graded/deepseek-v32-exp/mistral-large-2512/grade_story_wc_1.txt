<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular (glass artist's perception, adaptive resilience), with embodied emotion (scars, cold water touch). Her motivation to understand the fire intensifies to a higher-stakes choice upon learning the canyon's threat. The final charged poise—folding the ledger—is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values. Minor deduction because contradictory impulses under pressure are present but not deeply dramatized in the confrontation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: ledger leads to retracing, patterns, confrontation, revelation. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—"the canyon...was also a choice"—with cost legible in the weight of the ledger and the frost's inevitability. Orientation is clear within 120 words; one meaningful tightening (Jaren's confession) escalates cleanly to the ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, not backdrop. The canyon's quiet, frost patterns, and creek pressure Liora's choices and guide her via the ledger's routes. The environment constrains and charges the final image—frost as map, canyon as path—elevating the closure. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through her artist's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the fire) escalates through protagonist agency: retracing, finding patterns, confronting Jaren. The revelation that the whole canyon was targeted tightens options and raises the cost from personal loss to communal threat. The cost is unmistakable on-page in the "cold and inevitable" words and the ledger's weight against her thigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: glass artist's luminous vessels vs. scorched testament, adaptive resilience vs. irreversible change. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the canyon as path and choice, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture, silence, and the ledger's numbers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptually sharp voice—"canyon walls hummed with the weight of silence." Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Narrative distance is controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, maintaining a coherent perceptual signature throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffolds or loops. Figurative language ("shadows stretching long under the indifferent gaze of the stars") is purposeful and consistent. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, from reflective to tense. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artist, charcoal smuggling, and frost-pattern mapping feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh angle on loss and adaptation, transformed through specific, grounded choices in character perception and world detail. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
