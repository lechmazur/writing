<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lien's interiority is concrete and her motivation—to find where unused love is stored—drives the climax organically. The final choice to give Kwan Yin's tear is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her realization. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are embodied in the "weight in her chest."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: the realization that unused love is stored "in the hands of others." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early; the persistent constraint of the tear shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting—the viaduct, wisteria, fog—creates a vivid atmosphere that charges the final image. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin's tear function as micro-settings that constrain choice and deepen theme. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lien's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) escalates under the accumulative lens via density increase and a cadence shift in the healing encounter. Lien's agency in giving the tear narrows options and yields a visible cost in the father's eased shoulders and her own realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the tear and sparks, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates through gesture and image without moralizing. The central question is reweighted with conceptual cost, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lien, with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, as in "A pilgrim of sparks." No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor cliché ("like a spine of stone") does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spiritual curiosity, past-life memory, and artistic observation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail.</comment>
