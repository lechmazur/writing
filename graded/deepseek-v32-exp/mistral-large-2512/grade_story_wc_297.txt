<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation clear, but the sudden appearance of the woman and their brief interaction limits the relationship as crucible. His final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the weight of fear and hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a charged poise with felt cost. Orientation is clear early. The transition to the dream plain is abrupt but does not break causality or the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and maze topiary clipping are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens via density increase and cadence shift; cost is legible in the "weight of it—the fear, the hope, the anxious elation." Agency is clear but the cost remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of dreams and covenant emerges through particulars without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the star-strewn plain and the possibility of remaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Close third-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional. Voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Minor overwriting in figurative language does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream visions, covenant, and magical glade with specific details. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure feels inevitable.</comment>
