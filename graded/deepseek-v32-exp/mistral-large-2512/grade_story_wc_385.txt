<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and drives the plot; interiority is embodied (shell biting skin, breath catching). The final choice to sing with Veyan is earned by her prior seeking, though the cost is more implied than visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear; closure lands with a decisive change (singing to pull lost voices back) under a causal lens. The cost is conceptual (her voice no longer alone), but Veyan's convenient appearance slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and selective; the serpentine nexus and seashell charge the final image. The setting is integrated into action and atmosphere, though it leans toward generic fantasy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding echoes) escalates through Liora's agency; the meeting with Veyan tightens options. Cost is legible in the shift from personal curiosity to communal action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation and restoration emerges through concrete images (shell, echoes) without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material: the universe's hum becomes a story, a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is strong. Dialogue is minimal but natural. No head-hopping or distance issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and controlled with high information density; rhythm supports pressure. Minor telling moments ("richly perceptive senses") but no loops or figurative muddle that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of echo singer, lost sounds, and seashell bridge feels organic. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded details, though it echoes familiar fantasy motifs.</comment>
