<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are concrete; the final choice to touch the child's scar is earned by prior causality (shared scar, burning sensation) with visible cost (her lungs expand "as if for the first time"). The shadow keeper's micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: because she cut off contact, the world encroached, leading to the child's arrival via scar-linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (the scar burns, breathing steadies). The persistent constraint of scars as bridges shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral and pressures choice: the ashen sanctuary's walls press in, the doorknocker ring pulses with the child's breath. Vivid sensory detail ("starlight spilled like silver dust") is filtered through the keeper's perception and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) escalates through causal triggers (dreams, knocking, child's arrival). Protagonist agency drives the tightening; the cost is legible in the burning scar and the sanctuary's reaction. The final choice forecloses the path of total severance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of scars as bridges emerges through concrete particulars (matching scars, the doorknocker's glow). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the tactile connection and shared breath, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct poetic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The keeper's perceptual signature ("ashen charcoal sanctuary," "silver dust") is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; the final image lands with crisp clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (isolated healer, magical scars) through specific, grounded choices. The concept of linking through scars feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
