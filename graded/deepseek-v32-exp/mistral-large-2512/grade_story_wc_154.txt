<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and specific, with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (drawn back against orders). Her final choice to connect with the boy is earned by prior causality, and the cost of shared grief is visible. The boy serves as a mirror, not a deep secondary character, which fits the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("lotus-hearted ache"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of coral, casts, and notes tightens meaningfully to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the atrium, mist, and twilight creating a charged atmosphere. The brain coral fragment and casts function as micro-settings that constrain choice and directly shape the final image of connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal need for meaning/connection) escalates through accumulative pattern breaks: boy's appearance, matching casts, coral pulse. Lena's agency in aligning casts drives the tightening, and cost is legible in the shared, softened grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared anxieties and grafting meaning onto wounds emerges through concrete particulars (coral, notes, casts). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the glowing word "Home," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, translator-filtered perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful compression (anesthetic haze) supports the accumulative lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated; peak beats ("lotus-hearted ache") are clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of brain coral as fear-memory, translator with palimpsest cast, and child mirroring wounds feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet, lyrical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
