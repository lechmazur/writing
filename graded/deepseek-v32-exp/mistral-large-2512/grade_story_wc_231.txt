<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied; his shift from routine to accepting the stranger's memories is earned through micro-choices under pressure, with a visible cost in his new promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page; orientation is clear early; the boutonnière as a persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly selective and purposefully woven; the opal dock and boutonnière function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the closing image with alpine memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elias's agency—his investigation and decision—tightening stakes; the cost of carrying borrowed memories is legible in the final promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed legacy emerges organically from particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the boutonnière's reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; lyrical, rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; no head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with varied syntax and vivid imagery; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; line‑level propulsion supports the accumulative drive and closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of borrowed memories and isolated witness feels inevitable; specific, grounded choices transform familiar tropes; risk‑taking in lyric accumulation coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
