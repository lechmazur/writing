<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in memory, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the shift to belief is earned, though contradictory impulses are subtle rather than stark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost; accumulative lens holds; orientation is immediate; persistent constraints (dusk, lullabies) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective; the terrace and dusk function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image through the prism parapet and temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (painting/believing the mirage) escalates via agency under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the weight of being the last rememberer and the focused effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and perception emerges through particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates in lullabies and the watchman’s dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical perceptual signature; voice modulates with emotional intensity; purposeful elision (the mirage's nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and heightens closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage painting, coded lullabies, and borrowed heartbeat; specificity anchors emotional truth; risk in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
