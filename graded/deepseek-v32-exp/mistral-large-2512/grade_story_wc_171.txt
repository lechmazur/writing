<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is strong, with interior contradiction (trembling resolve, weariness) and micro-choices (traces clipboard, closes hand around coin) that reveal values. The final choice to "carry it together" is earned by the prior dialogue and Kessar's shift. Minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic label-speak ("operatively gentle" feels slightly writerly, though it's anchored in voice).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of shared burden crystallizes options with felt cost. Drive lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Situational pressure), held consistently. Orientation is immediate. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's "weight of the moment."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (scent of jasmine, scuffing boots). The terrace and clipboard function as micro-settings that charge the final image. However, the environment doesn't actively constrain choice; it's atmosphere-rich but could apply more pressure. Thus, it misses the 9+ gate where setting must constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace/redemption) is signaled early. Escalation under the Hybrid lens is a meaningful tightening via Kessar's probing question and the exchange of the coin, which deepens the negotiation's personal cost. The cost is felt but not sharply narrowing; the final choice is more a stance crystallization than a foreclosed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme ("the price of redemption") emerges seamlessly from concrete particulars (the singed treaty, the silver coin). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared burden. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence (the coin press, the chant).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, close-third with a distinct perceptual signature. Voice is controlled, with rhythmic modulation. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She thought of all the wars...") create slight distance in a high-pressure beat, preventing a higher score. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with strong rhythmic control. A template-cadence run appears ("Liora had spent... Liora had mustered... Liora was tired.") which, while pattern-taught, slightly dulls momentum. No figurative muddle; closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of war-weary negotiator, ritual space, and philosophical cost feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded choices transform the "peace talk" trope. The final reconfiguration is earned and avoids middle-ground hedging. A slight deduction for a familiar celestial alignment motif.</comment>
