<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in past guilt; his micro-choices in weaving the rope reveal a hierarchy of values, and the earned change is felt in the weight easing from his chest, though the emotional progression is slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the aurora's approval and his eased weight, making the before/after change undeniable and the structure cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and ceremonial rope create a vivid atmosphere that charges the final image; sensory details are selective and filtered through Elias's POV, though constraint on choice is mild.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten names escalates through the density of the weaving act; agency drives the climax where the rope hums with names, and cost is felt in his emotional release under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and forgiveness emerges through concrete particulars like the punched card and rope; the ending offers a non-literal answer with the rope's song humming in his bones, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is shaped by Elias's craft, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; no loops or scaffolds, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "like the slow heartbeat of a sleeping god."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting with memory preservation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, offering fresh emotional truth.</comment>
