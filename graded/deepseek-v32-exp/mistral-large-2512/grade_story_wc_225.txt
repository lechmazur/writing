<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through fidgeting and decoding; interior contradiction between changing past and accepting forgiveness is dramatized; final renunciation of fidgeting earned by causal sequence with visible cost in the exhale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elias stops fidgeting and exhales; causal lens holds from tapestry decoding to mirror memory; orientation anchored early; platinum labyrinth as persistent constraint shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (frozen village, woven hush) and objects (labyrinth, tapestry) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details like "breath of frost" are selective and filtered through Elias's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forgiveness escalates through Elias's agency in decoding and stepping through the mirror; cost legible in labyrinth's searing heat and coiling threads; one meaningful tightening leads to Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and forgiveness emerges from events and images without direct statement; subtext in silence and woven hush; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through stillness and exhale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and precise, matching Elias's introspective mind; no head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "woven hush" is consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally; no artifacts obscuring closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guilt, memory, and redemption; organic combination of chess, labyrinth, and tapestry feels inevitable; turns earned through character choice; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
