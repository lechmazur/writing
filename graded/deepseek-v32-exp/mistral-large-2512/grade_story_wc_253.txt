<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's grief is embodied through ritualized micro-choices; his motivation to "cultivate lightness" is clear and drives the narrative. The final endurance (speaking to avoid silence) is earned by prior causality with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; mosaic shards (present, memory, dream) cohere with taught transitions. Closure is an Earned Stasis—"kept speaking, because silence was the one thing he couldn't bear"—with felt cost legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (farmhouse, turbines) and objects (dried flowers, whittled bird) are vivid, sensory, and charge the final offering. The turbines' groan and shadows consistently mirror internal state, reweighting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional survival escalates through pattern intensification (ritual repetition, dream, next morning). Protagonist agency in narrating tasks deepens the void; cost is unmistakable in the final avoidance of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as private rebellion emerges from concrete particulars (whittling, mandated joy). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—endurance through ritual—without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic, controlled, and reflects Elias's numb state. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure, maintaining coherence and purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful; no loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian premise with intimate grief rituals; specifics (whittling, narrated tea) feel inevitable and organic. Emotional truth is grounded in unique, character-particular details that heighten stakes.</comment>
