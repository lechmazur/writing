<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (healing vs. destruction) acting in scene; her final choice to teach the girl is earned by prior causality and scars, with visible cost in the coin and past. No diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; orientation anchored early; closure is a Charged Poise (Lena stays to teach, reconfiguring purpose) with cost legible in the coin's glint and scars. Persistent constraints (coin, sand) shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory (obsidian lagoon, black sand), filtered through Lena's POV; the coin and sand charge the final image, with environmental details mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation via density increase: the girl's arrival deepens stakes, and Lena's agency in dialogue and decision to teach reweights options with cost felt in her scars. One meaningful tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and action (scars singing, light from dark); subtext in coin and sand; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's attention to fire/destruction imagery); lyrical prose modulates with emotional beats; dialogue natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely; clarity maintained through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise (arsonist's daughter firefighter) is fresh and transformed through specific details; emotional truth anchors originality; quiet risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
