<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like setting up instruments and interpreting dreams. Micro-choices under pressure, such as planting the seed and reciting the treaty, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost visible when some villagers leave.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with the seed sprouting and monsoon arrival, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in the departure of some villagers and the ridge steadying. The drive lens holds throughout, with patterns converging meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the ridge, shells, and seed constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as the lattice of shells translating murmurs and the jacaranda shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, with escalation driven by protagonist agency through dream interpretations and the planting ritual. Cost is visible in the villagers leaving and the reef's acceptance, narrowing options under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete events and images, such as the seed splitting and the monsoon washing released elements, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in dreams and rituals, embracing complexity and doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, whimsical voice that reflects the protagonist's perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., dream fragments) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "the monsoon arrives as agreed, washing only what we chose to release."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise is fresh and transformative, blending empirical whimsy with cultural memory. Specific details like the knowledge fruit seed and interpreted dreams create a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
