<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like prizing the halo fragment. The final renunciation—setting the fragment and accepting the garden's rehearsal—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost in the fading photographs. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between touching the past and letting go, revealed through specific actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a conceptual repricing where time's texture is reconfigured through the halo's disintegration and the garden's steadiness. Cost is legible in the "afterimage of the circle" and the photographs clearing to "paper as unmarked as snow." Orientation is anchored early with the living bridge garden and the old brief, and the pattern of time's rehearsal pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "roots groaned the way wood does when time is bent too hard" and "birds nested above and beneath at once." Micro-setting (the halo fragment, fading photographs) actively shapes tactics and closure. Specificity is high, filtered through the protagonist's professional bias, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering time's texture escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases, such as the paths braiding with earlier footfalls and the photographs fading faster. Protagonist agency drives tightening, as prizing the halo fragment and setting it down force a trade-off with cost legible in the garden's shiver and the lost details. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time and memory emerges organically through events and images like the fading photographs and the halo's disintegration, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "felt pattern, an inward weave," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, such as the garden reclaiming its light, and earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "paths multiplied like coral" and "retrocognitively trapped." Prose rhythm and diction reflect the protagonist's mindset under pressure, with purposeful compression in peak beats. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific, with lyrical control that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "Every bridge I crossed remembered a different crossing" advancing story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural modulation, and closure image remains sharp despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of a living maze exploring time, with specific, non-obvious choices like hyperbolic geometry and retrocognitive trapping. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through grounded detail and a bold closure.</comment>
