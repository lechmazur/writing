<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation to understand ghosts' intentions is clear and consistent, driving his actions with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to resolve the chess tutor's game is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the symbolic laying down of the king. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as Rowan sets up the chessboard and lets the clock run, reweighting the premise with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with patterns of imagery and reflection leading to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt silo and tapestry constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "palms blackened with soil," integrating environment into action. The silo functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Rowan's agency under the accumulative lens, as decoding the echo leads to the decisive act of setting up the chessboard. The cost is legible in the "visible river of seconds" carrying the lesson out of debt, narrowing options and reweighting stakes. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the tapestry and echoes, offering a non-literal answer to grief and intention without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the coin and thimble's shadow, inviting reflection. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Rowan, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction remains within Rowan's lexicon, and elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold obscuring causality. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "uncharted echoes pooled there," and rhythm accelerates with scene needs. Read-aloud ear test passes with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of gardener, silo, and echoes, transforming tropes through specific grounded choices. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
