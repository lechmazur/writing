<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to free creativity is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as "a thin line of cold remained inside me." The final choice to free creativity and bear the cost is earned by prior causality, with micro-choices like tracing the instrument revealing values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; flaws like the cost of the lock and key complicate the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the protagonist's internal coldness and the town's renewal. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear within 120 words (aurora-lit archway, frost, purpose). The persistent constraint of the unwritten calendar and instrument shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of the rested instrument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "frost in my hair" and "air tasted of old ink and comet tails." The aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through POV bias, reflecting the protagonist's priorities. Environment subtly mirrors internal states, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing creativity is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency, such as tracing falling stars. Cost is legible in the "thin line of cold" and the protagonist's altered state. Pressure coheres and tightens with one meaningful deepening when the instrument combs the night to free syllables. Resolution is earned by alteration and renunciation, with visible prices paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of creativity versus fear emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like "shy lamps leaned out." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the key of angles and winter light, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as remembered stardust blooming into maps. No thematic echo or sermonizing; complexity embraces cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic and rhythmic under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "the aurora rippled as if amused." Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within the protagonist's lexicon, with clean psychic distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally, with sentences like "They sang ideas without sound" propelling momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats; syntax supports emphasis without monotony. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors is balanced by clarity and purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of astronomical imagery and creativity's liberation, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed via specific choices, like the unwritten calendar and remembered stardust. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with authentic vision in the cost of mapping "what should not be measured."</comment>
