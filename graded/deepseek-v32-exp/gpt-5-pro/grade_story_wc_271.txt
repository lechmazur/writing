<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Samira's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic markers and trauma responses shaping her micro-choices under pressure. Her decision to move the ceremony indoors is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of the overlook for the glasshouse carries visible cost, foreclosing a path with felt emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with Samira placing the photograph under the basin, reweighting her past with cost. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The ending image of "water returns and does not drown" makes the cost legible and undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting actively constrain choices, such as the storm forcing the ceremony indoors, and charge the final image with the "pearl of stillness." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Samira's POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Samira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the storm and chair's email tightening pressure, leading to her decisive move indoors. The cost is legible in her flinch and the shared relief of guests. One meaningful deepening reweights the stake of safety versus spectacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the photograph and pearl of stillness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to trauma and healing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Samira smoothing the photograph. The ending reweights prior material with complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic diction and rhythm that modulate with pressure. Elision, like the drone's arrival, is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal, carrying subtext in Theo's interaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "glass ribcage," is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the storm, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, supporting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike survivor, arboretum, and somatic markers feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fully committed, with originality arising from character-driven choices.</comment>
