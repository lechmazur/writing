<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., using the river stone to soothe the shadow) leading to an earned renunciation that binds the shadow to kindness. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the shadow's yearning versus its inability to speak, and the final choice is motivated by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the shadow is bound and hope is preserved, with cost legible in the final image ("the shadow bows and is finally bound to kindness"). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the river stone and library setting charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image, such as the western window and river stone influencing the shadow's transformation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "paper scents mingle with ozone"), filtered through the narrator's POV, and the library's environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through density increase as the shadow remembers its name, driven by the narrator's agency in comparing footage and inscribing the spine. Cost is unmistakable in the shadow's transformation and the narrator's acted hope, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the river stone and silent films, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to hope and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, such as the shadow shaping itself along the stone, and the ending reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "My steps are softly deliberate." Purposeful elision (e.g., the silent footage) is taught and paid off, and voice remains coherent without head-hopping, enhancing the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and supports clarity, even in peak beats (e.g., "pollen of letters"), and sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, avoiding artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes dream-sharing and shadow metamorphosis with specificity, feeling inevitable through character choices like the cataloging of ache. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept is transformed through grounded details like the river stone's recurrence.</comment>
