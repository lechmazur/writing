<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. Her final choice to restart the carousel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in paying with a memory. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her regret versus resolve, compelling higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Mara decides to restart the carousel, reconfiguring meaning under an accumulative/textural lens. The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the camera wheel as a persistent constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the ghost negotiation provides a decisive change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon setting pressures choices and charges the final image, with sensory details vivid and purposeful. The environment constrains tactics, such as the lagoon storing stories and the carousel's halt driving urgency. Micro-setting elements like the camera wheel are integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in her memory payment. The dominant stake (restarting the carousel) tightens through the ghost negotiation, forcing a trade-off. Protagonist agency alters options with visible price, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and regret emerges from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the ghost interaction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's decision to tend stories, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Mara, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and poetic, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; diction and syntax reflect her state and bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no figurative muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; language is concise and vivid, advancing story and atmosphere. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of elements like the camera wheel and ghost negotiation, feeling inevitable in hindsight.
