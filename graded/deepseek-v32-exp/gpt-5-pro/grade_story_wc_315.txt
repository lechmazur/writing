<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to preserve trust is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "my stomach becomes the canopy") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Relationship with Lio serves as crucible, forcing revisions that test autonomy versus care. Final endurance of watcher's burden is earned by prior causality, with cost in ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (earned stasis in watcher's role) and cost legible in "void the self" and renewed patience. Orientation anchors early; causality tight through buckle crisis and guided resolution. Persistent constraint of trust under pressure shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with arbor and clouds breathing like a lung, constraining choices via gusts and winds. Parachute buckle as micro-setting charges closure by pivoting life. Sensory detail selective and purposeful, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving trust escalates under Accumulative lens through buckle failure and guided repair, driven by narrator's agency in revising signals. Cost unmistakable in near-failure and relief, narrowing options and deepening trust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of watcher's burden emerges through particulars like muscle memory and soundless echo, not statement. Ending reweights prior material via "small bright vow" without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity on trust and sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "currents stitched through the dark"). Voice poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose and dialogue that advances goal. No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language consistent and purposeful (e.g., "canopy" as stomach). No loops or scaffold; clarity maintained in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of watcher archetype with specific arbor setting and trust dynamics feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through embodied detail and emotional honesty.</comment>
