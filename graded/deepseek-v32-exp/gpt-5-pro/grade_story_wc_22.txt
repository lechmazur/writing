<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to reclaim peace is clear and dramatized through specific actions like reading bird calls and planting seeds. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the scent fells him to quiet tears." Micro-choices reveal values, such as offering a pod instead of a fare. However, contradictory impulses are more reflective than active in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern-based escalation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration via the final image of the garden "signing its name," reweighting prior material with cost legible in war memories and renewal efforts. Orientation is anchored early, and structure is coherent with smooth transitions. Persistent constraints like the dead reef shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "birds wrote paragraphs" and "salt veins" filtering through the POV. The jetty, seed pods, and birds function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Atmosphere supports theme consistently, and spatial choreography is clear despite lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming peace escalates under accumulative lens through density increases in bird calls, planting, and the veteran's arrival. Agency drives escalation, e.g., planting based on tern taps, with cost visible in emotional responses and effort. One meaningful tightening occurs when the veteran cracks the pod, reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of peace and renewal emerges organically from images and actions, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like pod offerings and bird calls. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer with "the garden will sign its name," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "I speak dead languages to them." Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and perceptual signature is unique. Dialogue with the veteran is natural and goal-driven. Purposeful elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "rattle like rosaries," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and read-aloud flow is smooth. Closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing ecological and war renewal with unique elements like bird call mapping and dead languages. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices. Emotional truth is authentic, and risk-taking in lyrical narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
