<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "the girl kept borrowing my pulse." Micro-choices under pressure, such as setting the snow globe and promising to expose the truth, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation to carry the name is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the name "Leda" is spoken and the narrator commits to action, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the promise and the shrine's reaction, with persistent constraints from dreams and the setting shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is tight with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glacier shrine and candles constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "candles bruise the blue with honey" are selective and filtered through POV, mirroring internal states. The environment pressures the narrator's actions and contributes to the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging the girl's name is signaled early and escalates through the narrator's agency, driven by dream analysis and ghostly confrontation. Cost is unmistakable in the narrator's commitment to expose the truth, narrowing options under the causal lens. The tightening forecloses other paths with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth and erasure emerges through events and images like the melted snow globe, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the name's revelation and the promise to act. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in lines like "windows of connection bloom." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision is taught and paid off. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "borrowed starlight filters through seams," and propulsion is clear. Sentence-level craft supports momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of ghost whispering, dream analysis, and glacial setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like the snow globe transform familiar tropes. The premise is fresh and fully committed.</comment>
