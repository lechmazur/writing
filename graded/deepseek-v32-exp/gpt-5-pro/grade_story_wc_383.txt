<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "charmed skeptic" identity drives micro-choices under pressure, with embodied contradiction in "I am a charmed skeptic, a keeper of proofs and improbable petals." Final transformation into a door is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "I stand until my bones ring."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as protagonist becomes a threshold, with cost legible in "I open, not outward, but along, and Reina walks through me into the dawn." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "hedges breathe like sleeping animals" are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (seashell, glass bell) alters tactics and deepens closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating isolation into independence) escalates through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens, from listening to releasing. Cost is unmistakable in "Independence fills like sunlight... where my solitude kept stiff furniture."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the seashell and resonance structures; ending offers a non-literal answer with "practice kindness" revealed, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, e.g., "Bells ring not by striking but by memory echoing itself." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "paper gull" is coherent and pattern-taught. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quarantine, resonance, and garden as archive feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in "dew numbers each grief" avoids template plots.</comment>
