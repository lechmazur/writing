<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like tracing the program and playing the harmonic. Interior contradiction between obedience and disruption is shown in scene, and the final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the mezzanine cracks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages from decoding the program to disrupting the rehearsal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the "settling groan" and cracked mezzanine, and the ghost's message shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "water that smelled of rope and varnish" pressuring choices. The flooded opera house and lanterns constrain actions and charge the final image of the moon through the broken cornice, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from decoding the message to playing the harmonic. Cost is unmistakable in the mezzanine failure and water surge, foreclosing options with felt consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "in between spaces" emerges organically through images and events, not statement, with subtext in the wordless conversation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, as in the reflection on tuning silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as noting "lanterns spoke in shivers." Voice is lyrical and consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, supporting the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "sliced the air like cracked glass" is purposeful and clear, and propulsion accelerates to the climax without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing ghostly communication through water damage in a flooded setting. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight, with transformation through specific detail.</comment>
