<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lys is vividly characterized with clear motivation and micro-choices, such as cupping letters like moths; her "regally unpretentious" trait influences actions, and the gardener adds secondary pressure. The final choice to sunder the sentence is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot has strong causality under a causal lens, with orientation clear early; closure is a decisive change as the pretender is unmasked, with cost legible in his smile falling and the ledger cracking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly detailed and constrains choices, such as the library shifts guided by the rune of drift; sensory details like "dust moved like thoughtful constellations" are purposeful and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lys's agency, from cryptic messages to confrontation; cost is visible in the pretender's defeat and the reconfiguration of history, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus manipulation emerges through images like iron gall ink and the rune; ending offers a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, as books "cough up alternate margins."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature in lines like "letters in the margins unstuck from paper"; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no artifacts or loops; figurative language like "smile like linen" is coherent and supports clarity even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh, synthesizing library magic and historical revisionism; specific details like the iron gall ink pellet and rune of drift heighten stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
