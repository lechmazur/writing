<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to find the brother is clear and drives the plot; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., Gable nosing the leaf). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final action to find water is earned by prior causality. Minor lack of strong interior contradiction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the community unites around water, reconfiguring distance into closeness with felt cost ("pipes sighed, buckets brightened"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong through image density; orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices; the scrapyard pressures tactics, and objects like the leaf and phonograph constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding connection escalates through protagonist's agency in solving riddles and using the leaf, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the effort to uncover water and the emotional investment, driving a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of distance versus closeness emerges organically through images and events, not statement; subtext in the leaf and phonograph leads to a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure enhances clarity. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied syntax that propels momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; read-aloud rhythm is strong, and closure image is sharp without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements with poetic devices feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like the wax leaf and phonograph. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
