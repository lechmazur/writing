<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like "letting that borrowed gravity seat the pins." Final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "luminous ache" and escape velocity from fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in "forgiveness I could not name spread through the bolts." Orientation is clear early, and pattern taught by quakes and leaf sound pays off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lunar observatory setting pressures choices via quakes and micro-setting (leaf sound, clock) that constrain repair tactics. Sensory details like "rails under the dome shivered the way breath shivers a candle flame" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing the ephemeral (comet) escalates under accumulative lens through clock failure and repair; agency in restructuring with cost in longing and dust "rehearsing their departure." One meaningful tightening forecloses blur, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality versus constancy emerges through particulars like the leaf and escape velocity, with subtext in "leaving and staying can be one motion." Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction and rhythm, e.g., "time itself is snagging in the gears." Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting in peaks like "luminous ache" repetition slightly dulls closure. No major artifacts; rhythm and syntax propel scene, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lunar repair with poetic themes feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "governor floating loose" transform familiar tropes through character choice.</comment>
