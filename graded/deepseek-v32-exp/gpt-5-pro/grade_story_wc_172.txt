<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (amoral philanthropy vs. secret sentimentality) act simultaneously in scene, embodied in micro-choices like cradling the egg and the compromised water release. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("my ledger has teeth").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "promise hurt, because promises always imply a future." The salt flat and chamber constraints shape the final image of nightly echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat setting constrains choices (stillness for sound, chamber for echo) and charges the final image with the bird learning the "vanished elders." Sensory details like "sky taut like glass" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: hatching the egg forces a compromise decision with cost ("narrower grace"). Stakes (preserving echo vs. commercial leverage) tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of compromise emerges from particulars like the egg as "unsent letter" and the final image of "ugly saint." Ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature ("fractured grace," "brittle yet deliberate") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., drought backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with no loops or scaffold; figurative language ("conch shell... sea remembering itself") is purposeful and clear. Propulsion remains strong through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral philanthropy with extinct bird preservation in a manufactured drought setting feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
