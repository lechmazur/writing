<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion shown through actions like "breath tuning to the hush." However, no deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure, limiting the score below the 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the ghost's promise) and felt cost ("promise shaped like a pause") under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the courtyard interval tightening pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the misty courtyard and tools like the flower press bolt plate constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in encoding messages, with cost legible in the ghost's response. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the conflict remains low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from events and images, with subtext in the graffiti and ghost's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as seen in the "promise shaped like a pause" that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., "between lightning and thunder") is taught and paid off, and no head-hopping occurs, supporting clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing momentum without obscuring causality, even in peak beats like "the interval opens like a workshop drawer."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost in code and balladeer using graffiti art feels fresh and specific, with a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes. Risk-taking in structure and tone coheres without gimmickry, and the closure effect is legible and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
