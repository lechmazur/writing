<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's whimsical nature is consistently embodied through specific actions like cradling the vine tendril "the way a luthier holds a bow," and his motivation to restore the covenant drives key choices. Interiority is shown via embodied emotion, such as grinning "like dawn itself" then growing still, with micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—stepping back to let the village continue—is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the arbor's shiver and bees returning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the arbor's "yes" shiver, bees scribbling approval, and villagers singing on—a charged poise where belonging is crystallized. Cost is felt in the "bright sigh" of the golden thread and the moon's departure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, taught by pattern density (moon alignment, forgotten songs) paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The verdant arbor constrains choice—the vine tendril's "green patience" and branch shadows as glyphs direct Lio's actions—and charges the final image where leaves "angle themselves to catch the new light." Sensory details are selective and purposeful (dew "stitched silver," light "combing leaves"), filtered through Lio's perceptual bias as a tinkerer. Spatial choreography remains coherent, with tools and bodies interacting tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the sacred covenant—escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases: the ritual intensifies from bells quivering to villagers joining, with a snag ("something snagged like a burr") resolved by child-led alignment. Agency is clear in Lio's pivotal choice to speak "in the tree's grammar," foreclosing isolation with cost in the arbor's shiver. Pressure coheres without coincidence, tightening via cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through gratitude and communal practice emerges implicitly from particulars—Lio's knot "shaped like a steady star" and the elders' statement "not to trap power, but to share it." Subtext operates in gestures like the child receiving the spindle, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "braid of duty and joy." No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete actions like singing forgotten songs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person focused on Lio, with a distinct perceptual signature—noticing "glyphs only the careful could read" and sap's "soft stirring." Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure (e.g., "grinned like dawn itself" to "pauses like commas where leaves met"). Rhythmic prose ("dew hummed, and the thread drew the first chord") heightens tension without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere ("The moon sank a finger width, and dawn pushed rosy pollen"). No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "golden thread tightened with a bright sigh"). Minor overwriting risk in peak beats (e.g., "scribbling approval") but clarity remains, and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of tinkering and ritual to restore ecological covenant, with specific, irreplaceable details like dew catchers and spindle carved from "the orchard's oldest limb." Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off at closure, transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices. The final image of "birds stitched words into the air" feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
