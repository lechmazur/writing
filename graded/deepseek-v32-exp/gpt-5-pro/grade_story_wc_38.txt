<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in defiance and memory, with embodied emotion shown through actions like rolling dice and dancing. Interiority is concrete, such as carrying Sora's dice, and the final liberation choice is earned by prior causality. Minor abstraction in phrases like "encrypt vulnerability as strength" does not undermine overall strength.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the liberation of minds, under an accumulative/textural lens where pattern buildup leads to change. Cost is legible in the risk of sabotage. Orientation is strong early, with who, where, and when anchored by "sunken laboratory" and "Neri waits." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "flooded corridors" and "algae" that constrain choices and charge the final image. The sunken laboratory pressures tactics, such as dancing in confined spaces, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberating minds escalates under accumulative lens through coded entries and dance, narrowing options. Agency is clear in protagonist's actions, with cost legible in the defiance against the State. One meaningful tightening occurs as the daemon is manipulated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of encrypting vulnerability as strength emerges organically from events and images, such as the dance and journal entries, without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through liberation, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct lyrical voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual signature like "rust recognizes my steps." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision in code-breaking is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language like "water blooms with light." No major artifacts or loops; minor density in metaphors does not obscure clarity. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of code-breaking through dance and journals feels inevitable, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes. Concept is transformed through specific details like hangman's dice, and closure remains legible without gimmickry.</comment>
