<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in their unique profession and ability, with interiority shown through concrete observations like "dust is honest." The final choice to unwind the mechanism is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the initial passivity ("they had sent me here") slightly limits agency, but the active engagement later compensates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the truth is revealed and the narrator feels "lighter," with cost legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The hatch opening and mechanism unwinding form a decisive change that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image, as the ticket office and ceiling directly shape the narrator's tactics. Sensory details like "paint curled from the window bars" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional bias. The environment evolves causally with the discovery, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from investigating dust to engaging the mechanism, narrowing options. The cost is legible in the unwinding of "crooked time" and the ghosts' release. The dominant stake (discovering hidden truths) tightens meaningfully, though the escalation is more gradual than abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like "cracks in the facade" and the mainspring barrel, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to hidden agreements without moralizing. Subtext operates in ghost dialogue and imagery, and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost. The ending avoids tidy resolution, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by the narrator's profession ("elevators teach the truth of loads"). Voice modulates under pressure, and diction remains within the character's lexicon. Experimental elements like ghost dialogue are taught and legible, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "Dust sifted down, uncurling in filaments" advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor density in peak beats doesn't obscure clarity, and closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes elevator repair and ghost-seeing in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details like the mainspring barrel transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, supported by authentic vision.</comment>
