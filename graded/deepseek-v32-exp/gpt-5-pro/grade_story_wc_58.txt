<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand healing is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices like tying the thread revealing hierarchy of values. Mira applies secondary pressure, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in the garden's transformation. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where the protagonist's realization that staying enables travel through story-carrying reweights absence with mercy. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of stitching the map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the garden and thread constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details like "lanterns veiled by vines" and "leaves scissor down" reflect POV bias and mirror internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding healing escalates through protagonist's agency in projecting presence for Mira and others, narrowing options and deepening knowledge. Cost is felt in the "geography of healing" surfacing, though one minor tightening could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence and healing emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the map-stitching final image. Subtext operates in gestures like Mira's letter, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating under pressure. Dialogue with Mira is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "gulls sound like hinges" is purposeful and clear, enhancing momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of writing obituaries for the living is fresh and transformed through specific details like the thread and projecting presence. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
