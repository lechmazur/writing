<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to graft onto community is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion like "luminescent ache." Interiority is concrete, and the final choice to weave the bench is earned by prior causality, though the change feels slightly swift. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and relationships force alterations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration in the bench dedication and sigil dissolution, costing a felt shift from solitude to belonging. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening, and the cost is legible in "I felt held like light is held by water."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "crystals chimed like thawing bells" and "fruit that tasted like the sound of rain on linen." The orchard and arbor constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating into action and reflecting internal states without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging is signaled early and escalates through protagonist's agency in the search and weaving, under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the dedication scene, foreclosing isolation with visible price. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of community emerges through events and images like the weaving and sigil, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "Community was a muscle of reaching," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, earning wisdom through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "reeds remember every hand." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Voice is consistent and poetic, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "luminescent ache" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity, and closure is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like marsh-reed sculptor and crystalline orchard feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific and memorable, with a fresh inflection in the closure.</comment>
