<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's final action is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is subtle rather than deeply contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (the arch repair restores echoes), and the causal lens holds tightly. Orientation is immediate, and the arrow tip as a persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., water flow navigation) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding resilience) escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, with a visible cost in the arch repair. One meaningful tightening narrows options and changes knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant non-literal answer (resilience as a hinge) without moralizing. Subtext operates in objects like the arrow tip.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., gravity inversion) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats like the arch repair.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional, with a fresh synthesis of elements (e.g., echoes accelerating growth) that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
