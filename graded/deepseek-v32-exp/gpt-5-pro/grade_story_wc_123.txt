<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's meticulous curiosity and wariness are embodied in concrete choices, such as studying the wind laterally and collaborating with the woman after the message; the final vow to remain specific is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the risk of approaching the quarantine zone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and introspection; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in "promised the empty bench I would keep faith by remaining specific," and the quarantine zone persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (courtyard, pigeon, message tube) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like the fountain mumbling and pigeon's velvet motor are selective and filtered through POV, mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase—from being followed to receiving the message and forming a plan; agency drives the lateral approach, with cost unmistakable in the risk to report unowned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unowned truth emerges through particulars like the message "Bring rain truth" and the final grain-of-wood image; subtext operates in implication, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "progressing laterally across what they avoid saying"); dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and rhythmic control under pressure supports the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "folded paper boats" is purposeful, and closure image is clear, though minor density in peaks prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of storm recording and quarantine zones feels inevitable; risk-taking in literary style heightens stakes, and turns are earned through character-specific methods like lateral progression.</comment>
