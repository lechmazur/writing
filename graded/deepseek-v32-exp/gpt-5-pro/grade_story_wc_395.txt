<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in curiosity, with interiority concrete and embodied in actions like lying to open the vault. The final choice to let deletion be a home is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the quiet renunciation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and emotional progression is realistic with contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the protagonist's decision to "let deletion be a home," reconfiguring meaning under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from the inciting incident (recurring numbers) to the discovery. Persistent constraints like the archive's layers shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the social network archive constraining choices (e.g., "anaerobic layers" and "Sargasso" guiding the search). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as "the embroidery catches the room's blue like tide." The environment charges the final image and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth vs. corporate secrecy escalates under a causal lens through protagonist agency, such as lying to access the vault and discovering the deleted files. Cost is legible in the decision to not expose the file, foreclosing a path with visible trade-offs. Pressure tightens meaningfully with one major reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory, forgetting, and corporate complicity emerges organically through events and images like the patch and recurring numbers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the protagonist's realization. Subtext operates in implication, such as "disappearance is a system, not a drama."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in lyrical phrases like "steward of what people think they erased." Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Diction remains within the protagonist's lexicon, enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "ocean turning metal into rumor," without muddle in peak beats. Syntax supports emphasis, and word choice is specific and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept is original, synthesizing digital archives with a cold case in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like the patch as a key object, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
