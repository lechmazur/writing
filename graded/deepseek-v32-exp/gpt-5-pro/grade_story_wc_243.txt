<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to sign the covenant is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the haunting absence. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as duty versus personal grief, without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "haunted euphoria" and the ledger's signing. Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of her absence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the jetty constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "salt roses" and "blooming jetty." Environment pressures the ritual and mirrors internal states without cliché, integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful tightening in the ritual actions (e.g., steeping ink, writing) that narrow options. Cost is legible on the page in the "ache she made useful" and the haunted absence, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from events and images, with subtext in gestures like Kellen touching the locket. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "covenant is not a spell," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., her vanishing) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats like "haunted euphoria." Read-aloud rhythm is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized with specific details like the walnut-ink archivist and regenerated covenant, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
