<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority through taste sensations. Micro-choices, like using the ring to guide convergence, reveal values. Final belief in Naira is earned, though skepticism resolves somewhat quickly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost as weather is released and debt cleared; causal lens holds throughout. Orientation is anchored early, and the final image of the emergent compass reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lavender bluff and aurora constraining choices like the convergence. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from learning to guiding the convergence. Cost is legible in the release of weather and clearing of debt, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and duty emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the emergent compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue advances plot with subtext. Minor poetic density borders on overwriting but does not obscure clarity.</comment>
