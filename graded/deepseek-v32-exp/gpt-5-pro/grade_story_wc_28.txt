<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority ("memory bleed," "warm coldness") and micro-choices under pressure (using tessera to rename). Final renunciation of danger through renaming is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the leader's lowered rifle and the plaza's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (patrol stand-down and renaming) and cost felt in "the plaza tastes like rain making dust into mud and mud into bricks." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the tessera's pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("shattered sky," "ash and wind"), with the tessera as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy versus order escalates through protagonist's agency (using tessera to rename), narrowing options and leading to patrol stand-down. Cost is unmistakable in the leader's weathered warmth and the plaza's transformed atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy and renaming emerges through particulars (tessera, decree, patrol) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via renaming, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue with the leader is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Elevated diction is voice-motivated and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through specific focus on renaming and retrocognition. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
