<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The locksmith's reflective nature and motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" are consistently embodied through micro-choices like chalking angles and harvesting echoes, with the final decision to implant echoes into the mechanism earned by prior causality and visible cost in the transformed timer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the timer's revival and stored beats carry conceptual cost, anchored early in the marble cavern and wounded season, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains choices through echo patterns and light angles, charging the final image with "winter-humility" and shaping tactics like baiting echoes with a chime, all filtered through the locksmith's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under accumulative lens via density increases in echo harvesting; protagonist agency drives tightening through adjustments like filing gear trains, with cost legible in the mechanism's civic tick and the need to collect riskier voices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder versus reason emerges through particulars like the harvested echoes and cellar metaphor, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "A locksmith holds peripheries so that centers may live," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, reflective diction and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "echoes gathered like shy animals," and no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or figurative muddle; lines like "its tick like a cave drip made civic" advance story and atmosphere with clarity, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of locksmith tropes with echo harvesting feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes through specific details like the broken timer's "misaligned teeth," and the closure image reweights prior material with ingenuity.</comment>
