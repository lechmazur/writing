<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying through the search for the sundial. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., carrying the gnomon "as if carrying a sleeping bird"). The final choice to rebuild the sundial and restore faith is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the changed perception of bones and time. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is accumulative/textural, building through sensory details and reflections to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost as time "climb[s] out of the soil," reweighting the protagonist's stance. Orientation is clear early with "valley," "dig team," and "grandmother's burial chamber." The lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure effect is legible with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the catacomb orchard and sundial constraining choices (e.g., finding shards "in the nave of roots"). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("air carried figs and damp limestone"). The environment charges the final image as the orchard "shifted from fear to welcome." No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith and mending journeys) escalates under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency (searching for sundial pieces, rebuilding). Cost is legible on the page in the changed taste of bread and the realization that "bones looked less like endings." One meaningful tightening occurs as the sundial restoration reweights options. No coincidence or static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (sundial, bread, journeys) without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., "interrupted journeys braided into one long walk"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the sundial's shadow "like a hand in blessing." No moralizing or thematic drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is first-person and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature ("carried questions like water carried light"). Voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "time stepped over the threshold") is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "each tree a ladder for the restless dead"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. No overwriting or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of diaspora return and archaeological excavation, transformed through specific details (sundial, catacomb orchard). Emotional truth arises from grounded choices, and the core premise integrates organically. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. No template plots or derivative elements.</comment>
