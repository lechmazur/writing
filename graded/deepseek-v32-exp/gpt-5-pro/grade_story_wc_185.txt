<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in their role, with interiority shown through concrete actions and perceptions. The final choice to collaborate with the energy beings is earned by prior causality, and the change from mistaking quiet for absence to understanding it as a lattice demonstrates credible endurance. Minor abstractness in some descriptions does not undermine the closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the caves unclench and the path steps forward, legible cost in "like a jaw no longer afraid to sing." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of journey and collaboration pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with sensory details like "ice drum" and "ribs of calcite" constraining choices and charging the final image. The harmonic caves function as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and supports the theme through embodied interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes around finding quiet to prevent destruction escalate through the protagonist's agency, such as pressing the stone and tuning the room, with cost legible in the convergence and unclenching. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens is sufficient, though the escalation is more gradual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet as collaborative lattice emerges through images and events, not statement, with subtext in the energy beings' hunger. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "readiness that waited," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision in the lyric mode is taught and pays off at closure, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varied syntax, and no artifacts like loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity in peak beats such as the bloom of hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like harmonic caves and energy beings feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific detail and character choice, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
