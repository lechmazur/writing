<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The choir teacher's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The resolution with Reza and the nurse demonstrates earned endurance, foreclosing paths with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as Reza's anger and the nurse's hesitation, handled without stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the final image of the song touching roofs, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The rosette acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the shared breath and vocal harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "damp with leaves" and "library inhaled the cold" integrating atmosphere into action. The zither rosette functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image when light floods its lattice. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when the teacher facilitates Reza and the nurse confronting fears through breathing exercises. The dominant stake of achieving harmony amidst personal conflict deepens, and cost is unmistakable in their vocal interplay. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing arts and subtraction emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the rosette's nick marking fear. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the pattern on the wall, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical and controlled under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in "traveled stillness slid in," and elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "moon phases denote darkness" is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of singing by subtracting noise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals. Emotional truth and transformation of tropes through grounded choices show authenticity.</comment>
