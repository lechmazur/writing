<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the pen nib to intervene. The final choice to draft a confession is earned by prior causality with visible cost, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (drafting the statement and calling the journalist) and felt cost ("anger burns clean"). Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to resolution, with orientation anchored early and no plot breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (e.g., "dome exhales echoes") and constrains choices, such as the observatory's dome and catwalk shaping the confrontation. The environment charges the final image with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through proof by contradiction, narrowing options and leading to a legible cost ("surrender the mouse"). Dominant stake of truth vs. deception tightens coherently under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and regret emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in gestures like the pen nib's use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with poetic diction and rhythmic control (e.g., "truth writes better when history pricks your palm"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, maintaining clarity and momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of newsprint heiress and observatory setting feels inevitable, with risk-taking in blending poetic voice and logical method. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
