<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory impulses act in scene, such as Soren's fragmented stories. Final choice to scatter ash is earned by prior causality with visible cost in Soren's flinch and nod. Soren's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, though his character remains slightly abstract in places.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as ash is scattered into the mask, reweighting impermanence with cost legible in Soren's reaction. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building density to the final image. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the mask and rocking chair constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, such as "air tastes like slate" and "rocking chair groans." No generic descriptions; environment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with drawing process and Soren's stories building pressure to the scattering moment. Cost is unmistakable in Soren's flinch and the narrator's reflection. Dominant stake of safety vs. impermanence tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and truth emerges from events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like Soren's laugh "that pays for a silence." Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through ash scattering, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision taught early. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "powder the black until it listens." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting atmosphere without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Core premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing art and grief in a non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, like the ash scattering ritual. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
