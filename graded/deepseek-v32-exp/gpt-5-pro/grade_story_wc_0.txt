<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to strip drama is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like saving undramatic orchids. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "hands still tasting of salt and metal." Final endurance of gradual change is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the acceptance of decay. Minor lack of overt internal conflict, but contradictions are implied in the tension between measurement and mourning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) where gradual change is embraced. Cost is legible in the final image of children learning from dust maps. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure of assessment and planning coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, e.g., dust patterns guiding repair decisions. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "dust from butterfly wing stuck along the fractures." The greenhouse charges the final image, influencing the protagonist's tactics and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of adapting to decay escalates through protagonist's agency in assessing damage and planning repair. Under accumulative lens, density increases with patterns like dust maps, and cost is visible in the commitment to gradual change. No coincidental resolutions; escalation is driven by on-page choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of decay as a form of giving back emerges organically from images like butterfly dust and neutron star spin-down. Subtext operates through implication, e.g., "decay can be a form of giving back." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic lexicon. Voice remains consistent under pressure, e.g., "I prefer to test a slope before investing in a cliff." Dialogue with botanist is natural and goal-driven, advancing the triage plan.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "constellations too small for sky." Minor overwriting in peaks, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and post-flood recovery feels inevitable, with specific details like butterfly dust maps. Risk-taking in blending scientific and lyrical modes heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and theme.</comment>
