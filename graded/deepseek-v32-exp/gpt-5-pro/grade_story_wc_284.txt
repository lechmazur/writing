<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to fix the radio is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is shown through waiting and writing codes, though contradictory impulses are not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the radio speaks, under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the risks and emotional stakes, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "silver hush" and snow "shivering like sifted salt" that constrain choices and charge the final image. The environment actively shapes tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from climbing the bluff to fixing the radio, with visible cost in risks and emotional stakes. The dominant stake of finding courage tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fixing what's broken emerges organically from events and images like the pillbox and radio repair, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, and perceptual signature is character-specific. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is effective and coherent, advancing story without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in a fresh synthesis of the burned spy trope with emotional depth, specific details like the pillbox, and risk-taking in lyrical style. The premise feels inevitable and transformative.</comment>
