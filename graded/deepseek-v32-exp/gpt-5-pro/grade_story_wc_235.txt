<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like "jaded wonder" acting simultaneously. The final choice to keep the ledger is earned through the envy method, foreclosing paths with visible cost ("knuckles creaked"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as unrolling the scroll, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "let the mouth keep eating the stone." Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored. Mosaic structure with past selves is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the birch bark scroll and cabin rafters pressure narrative decisions. Sensory details like "creosote and spruce" are selective and POV-filtered. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using envy to interact with past selves, narrowing options. Cost is legible in "knuckles creaked" and the scroll's acceptance of ink. Dominant stake (distilling chaos) tightens through this method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the grave and scroll, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., "wind fretted, stones listened"). Final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent under pressure. Elision in dream sequences is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; dialogue with stove and past selves is natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, e.g., "second hand a skittish trout." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lucid dreaming and self-grave encounter with non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in mosaic structure and voice heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific detail feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
