<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to prove the garden knows him is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the maze's response. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (the maze exhales with him), under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of marbles shapes tactics. The ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The garden maze constrains choices and charges the final image (vines arch into a doorway). Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the Auditor's confusion and maze's lean. Pressure tightens meaningfully through marble placement and ceremonial acts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. quantification emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the garden knows me) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level craft supports scene needs without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes luck measurement and gardening in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
