<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to certify wonder is clear and rooted in synesthetic traits, compelling high-stakes choices like unfettering the hush. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "heart swinging like a slow pendulum." Final renunciation of command in favor of certification is earned by prior causality, though minor abstraction in peak emotions prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost: the hush "held like a carved harbor" after the synchronized strike. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the sculpted hush shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern setting pressures choices, e.g., frostfare waiting on breath, and charges the final image with "veins loosened their centuries." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, such as aurora colors guiding steps. Recurring objects like bells constrain actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of certifying wonder escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency: walking aurora paths and striking bells to unfetter the hush. Cost is legible as the hush "learned to carry courage without trembling." One meaningful tightening occurs at the synchronized strike.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as essential emerges through images like the sculpted hush bridging worlds, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the hush "curled beside me like a cat of light." Subtext operates in implication, e.g., amber sheet as "fossil of song."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., synesthesia "seeing every tone as bloom." Rhythmic control under pressure, such as "bell tongues quiet, heart swinging," and purposeful elision taught early. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "Color braided the hush, and it began to stand." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bell ringer, sculpted hush, and synesthesia feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like "amber music sheet." Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection in the synchronized strike reweights prior material.</comment>
