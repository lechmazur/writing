<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's defiance is rooted in tangible grief and anger, with micro-choices like leading poetry sessions that escalate naturally to the climax. Interiority is embodied through specific imagery ("paint bled down the ribs of the cliffs"), and the final confrontation earns its cost through prior causality. Contradictory impulses of mischief and stubborn anger act simultaneously in scene, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early with the canyon setting and protagonist's role; the Hybrid drive lens holds through closure, which is a Conceptual Repricing redefining forgiveness with cost ("the spire shivered in its fog"). Causality is tight, with poetry sessions leading directly to the elders' disorientation and the spire's reaction. The closure effect lands on-page with felt cost in the elders' fear and the community's defiance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting of bone towers and endless echoes actively constrains choices by refracting poetry, charging the final image where "light itself would refract." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's bias. The spire as a recurring object pressures tactics and reweights meaning at closure, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from secret poetry sessions to open confrontation, narrowing options and raising cost. The dominant stake—preventing another confession—tightens through community involvement, with legible cost in the elders' fear and the spire's fracturing light. Agency in reciting and misreciting rhymes forces a trade-off, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as echoes refracting meaning, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to forgiveness ("the work we do together to hold the shards") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like chalked faces hiding names, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, reflective, and biased—that modulates under pressure. Voice control is evident in rhythmic variations and purposeful elision, such as "forged hush" echoing the opening. No head-hopping; dialogue in recitations is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot through subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, like "prisms made of breath and bone," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax, and clarity is maintained even in dense passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes poetry and ritual in a fresh, non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific choices like echoing truth refraction. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Emotional truth is anchored in particulars, such as the sister's laugh "slid[ing] up the bones," avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
