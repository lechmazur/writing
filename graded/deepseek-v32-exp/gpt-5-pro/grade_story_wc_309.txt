<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as unstrapping the assistive charms. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "slumped" pack and internal shift. Contradictory impulses act in scene, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the unstrapping and realization about "attention given without hurry." The Accumulative lens holds throughout, with orientation clear early. Cost is legible in the keystone's interaction and the protagonist's altered state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as with mist walking and the keystone's role. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "mist rose like a staircase" and "ice scaled the granite." The spire and keystone actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in unstrapping the charms and embracing simplicity. Dominant stake (seeking sacred vs. automation) tightens through key turns, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the keystone's response and mist walking. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "sacred might mean nothing more arcane than attention given without hurry," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice coherence in phrases like "mist walking carried me home, footfalls lightly fingerprinting vapor." Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "lingering luminance like moonmilk." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of automation vs. humanity, with specific details like mist walking and the keystone transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
