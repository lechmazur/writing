<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values; ghost bride's motivation is clear and constrains choices, earning the final endurance with visible cost in the confession and ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "the debt is paid when you keep paying"; orientation is clear early, and pattern taught through ephemeral appearances pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the greenhouse and bead constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes of repaying debt and awakening trees escalate through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in the confession and final image, narrowing options with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and debt emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final reconfiguration without moralizing, inviting reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is lyrical and consistent, with elision taught and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
