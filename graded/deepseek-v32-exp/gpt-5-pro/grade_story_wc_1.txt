<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied interiority like "let my breath settle." The "steadily adaptive" trait drives key choices, such as retracing the route, and the final decision to rebuild is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the creation of "Scorched Testament." Contradictory impulses act in scene, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns in ledger and frost escalating to a Charged Poise closure where the protagonist reclaims purpose. Cost is legible in "the heat had written it twice," and orientation is clear early. The kiln as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, with the canyon and frost acting as a "quiet cartographer" that constrains choice by revealing the hidden path. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, and the kiln as micro-setting charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering purpose escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in retracing the route and interpreting patterns. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation from loss to arrival, with the creation of "Scorched Testament" foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the "scorched testament" and motifs of memory and resonance, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the glass piece, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost in "heat had written it twice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, e.g., "frost is a quiet cartographer." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision in patterns are taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, e.g., "drifting resonance," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass art, smuggling, and resonance feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific details like the ledger and kiln. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
