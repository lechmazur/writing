<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices under pressure; her blindness is not a label but a constraint that shapes tactics, and her motivation to decode feedback drives the plot with visible cost in the final calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the depot's calm reweights meaning; the Accumulative lens holds tightly, with orientation anchored early and causality flowing from Mara's actions without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the mist-coated depot and water bowls constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in repairing the drone and mapping tracks; the stake (finding the crate) tightens with a live clock, and cost is legible in the timing that "forgave everyone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening and balance emerges organically from particulars like the water bowls and drone repairs; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, reflecting Mara's perceptual signature; POV is stable and single, with rhythmic control under pressure and any elision (e.g., light refraction) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the drone's repair and return.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of blindness with technological repair; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
