<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal values. The final loosening of insomnia is earned through the armistice negotiation, showing credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—the blossom armistice and poet's changed state—with felt cost under the accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell and blossom factions pressure choices and charge the final image, with sensory details vivid and purposeful. Environment constrains actions, such as the Spiral Choir's acoustics guiding the negotiation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blossom armistice stake escalates through the poet's agency, with one meaningful tightening in the negotiation. Cost is legible in the softening of thorns and the poet's insomnia loosening, foreclosing war.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of photosynthesizing pain into beauty emerges organically through the armistice and postcard, with subtext in gestures like the guard's muttering. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The poet's voice is distinct and consistent, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable, and purposeful elision (e.g., "shyly unstoppable") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "drink the dark and exhale petals") but clarity remains, and no artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The concept of a blossom armistice is inventive and synthesized with the shell setting, offering a fresh angle. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
