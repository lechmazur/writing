<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to teach dust to tell stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices like unshawling the radio and replying to the voice. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the dust learning autonomy. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds through Mara's agency. The persistent constraint of the story famine shapes tactics and the final image, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the ember alcove housing the radio and dust. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image where the environment pressures Mara's actions and supports the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving stories escalates through Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with tightening via pirate broadcasts and patrol warnings. Cost is unmistakable in risks taken, and escalation is driven by her choices, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of storytelling as resistance emerges through particulars like dust formations and lyrics, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the dust's autonomy, reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's poetic, selective noticing. Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and any elision (e.g., lyric instructions) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity and propulsion in peak beats like the dust forming figures, without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-famine world, dust stories, and pirate broadcasts with non-obvious ingenuity. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
