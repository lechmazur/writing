<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values; the final endurance is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the narrator's vow test, and orientation is immediate with who, where, and when anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image through vivid sensory details (e.g., "frost-bitten ladders," "avalanches sighed"); the frozen library acts as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving meaning) escalates under accumulative lens through vow measurements; agency drives tightening, but cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from vow measurements, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext operates through imagery like "vows braided from their breath."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with a poetic perceptual signature; POV is stable, and rhythmic control under pressure enhances the accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax with zero loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the vow measurements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity; the frozen library and vow-measuring concept feel inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
