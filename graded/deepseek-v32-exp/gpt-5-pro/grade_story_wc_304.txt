<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concretely embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as the thickened hush when her mother arrives. Contradictory impulses—professional duty versus personal grief—are dramatized in scene, and the final renunciation (renewed duty) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The emotional progression avoids stock phrasing, rooted in specific sensory details like the smell of oils on her mother's palms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: the protagonist's renewed commitment to duty after her mother's ritual. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern intensification (aurora, grotto stillness) coheres, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The final image ("continuity" heard in silence) reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the grotto's silence and aurora's light directly shape the ritual's tactics (e.g., emerald resonance). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "stalactites held beads of condensation that chose not to fall." The environment evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the spark) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the emotional weight of her mother's farewell. A single meaningful tightening occurs when she dares to use the emerald chip, foreclosing other emotional paths. The climax is driven by her active choice, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (duty, memory, threshold between life and death) emerges through particulars like the emerald chip and aurora patterns, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the protagonist's renewed commitment, recharging prior teachings. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as the mother's note and the grotto's tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("listening between heartbeats"). Voice is consistently poetic and rhythmically controlled, even under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "threading a needle underwater") is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("ribbons of green folding like patient lungs") is coherent and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the ritual's intensity, and the final image lands with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mortician ritual, skyborne grotto, and emerald-chip technology feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tropes through specific, grounded details. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on farewell and duty.</comment>
