<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Karim's layered confession and the narrator's decision to allow him to stay are earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconstruction of trust. The final choice balances self-respect and compassion, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the chameleon's touch, reweighting the sanctuary's ethos with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of moral weight buildup pays off at the ending without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting as "misty workshop under stars" and the chameleon's tank function as micro-settings that pressure choices and charge the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust and integrity escalates under the Accumulative lens through the narrator's agency in confronting Karim and deciding his fate.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of faith, care, and redemption emerges through particulars like the chameleon's tail tip and the reconstruction, without direct statement.

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm.

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
