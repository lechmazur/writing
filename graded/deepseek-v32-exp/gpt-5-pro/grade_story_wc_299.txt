<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interior contradiction (practical yet tender) acts in scene; final choice to "midwife a new story" is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("ache open"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "ache open" and commitment to purpose. Orientation clear early; causality intact through discoveries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (quarry, trailer) constrains choice and charges final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "concrete dust and coffee"). Micro-setting (speaker cloth) evolves meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after loss) escalates under accumulative lens via protagonist's agency (examining cloth, wrestling drawer). Cost is unmistakable in emotional opening and redefined motive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of sound, memory, and purpose emerges through particulars; ending offers non-literal answer ("midwife a new story") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in images and gestures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable; voice has distinct perceptual signature (lyrical, reflective) and rhythmic control. Dialogue natural and goal-driven; elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language coherent and purposeful; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ex-roadie, quarry, and sound memory; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes. Premise transformed through specific detail and emotional specificity.</comment>
