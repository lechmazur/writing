<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and rooted in recurring dreams, with embodied interiority like "old vows stirring like moths in a jar." Her final choice to unmake her unmaking is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values. No significant weaknesses; contradictions act in scene, such as wanting light yet fearing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as she lays down her circlet, resolving the bleeding starlight with a felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly from dreams to revelation, and orientation is clear early. The grottos as lungs shape tactics, and cost is legible in "metal touched stone, the bleeding starlight slowed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "corridors sighed like veils" and "walls wept a sheen." The cobalt and ember grottos constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as micro-settings that alter tactics. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the queen's agency under the causal lens, from climbing to unmaking her unmaking. Stakes are signaled early and tighten with visible cost, such as cut palms and laid-down circlet. The dominant stake of unraveling dreams interweaves with external conflict, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of disenchantment and renewal emerges through images like bleeding starlight and unmaking, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the coronation fire memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-person limited, with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, with purposeful compression. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and supports momentum, e.g., "lace tightened around her throat and smiled." Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of disenchantment and metaphysical elements, with specific details like grottos as lungs. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
