<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ruth's internal contradiction in keeping the shard to remember the sharp part and the therapist's decisively kind micro-choices under pressure are embodied and earned. The final choice for a flawless goodbye is motivated by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the chord closes and silence answers, reconfiguring Ruth and Lena's relationship with felt cost. The Accumulative lens holds, and orientation is clear early with hospice setting and blood work results.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vinyl shard as a micro-setting constrains choice by being used as a pick, and the rooftop setting charges the final image. Sensory details like "oxygen whispering" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in calling Lena and facilitating reconciliation, with cost legible in the apology and closed chord. The stake tightens meaningfully around Ruth's desire for a flawless goodbye.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation and broken things singing emerges through particulars like the vinyl shard and hymning the mundane, offering a non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision like "pulsing stillness" is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "the sky leans close as witness," and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of hospice care with the vinyl shard and hymning the mundane, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure recharges prior material.</comment>
