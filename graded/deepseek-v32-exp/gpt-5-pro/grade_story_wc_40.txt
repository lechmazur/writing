<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like humming and recording echoes. The final choice to testify and return the crystal is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle. Cost is visible in the changed hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the hush hanging higher) and conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the crystal's return charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "gray light" and "creak of the ladders" filtering through POV. The library environment constrains choices (e.g., crystal use) and charges the final image with the exhaled room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency in testifying, under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the custodians' lowered eyes, though the abstract stake limits intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on growth in silence. Subtext operates in echoes and gestures, avoiding moralizing, with the final library-as-garden image reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong in biased noticing, and elision (e.g., fractured sequences) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, and propulsion is clear even in dense passages like the testimony scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing post-dictionary silence with growth decoding. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specifics like the crystal make it inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
