<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in sensory specificity; final choice to unseal the crate is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the weight lifts... lighter because it can be carried by many"). Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "feel the pull in my teeth," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (weight lifting as truth is shared); inferred Hybrid lens (causal dominant) holds without ambiguity. Causality is tight from the machine whisper to the shard's use and final redirection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., gantry climbing, shard refraction); sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The bay and shard charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from discovering logs to redirecting voices; cost is legible on-page ("weight lifts... spreads like a luminous tide"). One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images (e.g., shard, voices) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("bridges do not hoard weight"). Subtext in withheld truth and distribution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory-based, poetic); voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., parallel universes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "hum like captive summer." No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universes feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking with non-linear elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., refugee voices) avoid template plots.</comment>
