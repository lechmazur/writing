<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to clear the clog and confess is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the confession and busker's non-absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and cost (confession, clearing clog) under a causal lens; orientation is clear early, and structure tightens through discovered clues. The final image of the accordion sighing reconfigures meaning without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "wet coins and nettles" filtering through POV; the station and culvert constrain choices and charge the final image, as the environment directly shapes the narrator's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, from discovering graffiti to clearing the clog, with cost legible in the confession and physical effort. Stakes tighten meaningfully, foreclosing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth and redemption emerges through particulars like the confession and busker's silence, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV has distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with voice consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, and elision (e.g., graffiti clues) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. No loops or scaffold issues; peak beats like the clog clearing are crisp and unambiguous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of guilt and redemption through specific details (river chronicler, accordion) feels inevitable; risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
