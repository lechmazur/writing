<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurel's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with micro-choices like sending the message and brewing coffee revealing his values under pressure. His motivation to explore ethical storytelling drives the narrative, and his apology without poetry shows earned change with visible cost. Relationships with Ferro and Miri serve as a crucible, altering their dynamic by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Aurel's collaboration with the troupe reconfigures their storytelling approach, costing him authority but gaining unity. The causal lens holds strong from argument to resolution, with the story stick and ethical concern shaping tactics. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the final image of the dome holding its breath charges the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radar dome and campfire story stick function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "pencil scratches" and "meteor hush" filtered through Aurel's POV. The stick's notches and the dome's curvature mirror internal states without overt symbolism, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aurel's agency under the causal lens, from internal second thoughts to messaging the troupe and implementing new rules, with cost legible in his apology and the collaborative effort. The dominant stake of ethical storytelling tightens through a meaningful turn that forecloses his solo authority, supported by the audience-involved show.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the reversed "Listen" and puppet shows, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to ethical storytelling without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as Ferro watching Aurel "weighing a coin," and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Aurel's calligrapher mindset, evident in lines like "ink under his nails" and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue, when present, feels natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping; purposeful elision in reflection is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, with figurative language like "hive of second thoughts" serving character and pressure. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, and the final image sustains clarity and propulsion, avoiding artifice in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes ethical storytelling with specific, irreplaceable elements like the calligrapher POV and puppet shows, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and conflict.</comment>
