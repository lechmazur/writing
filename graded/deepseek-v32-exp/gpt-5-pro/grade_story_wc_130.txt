<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in ambiguous loss, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance—accepting uncertainty—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ache's exact coordinate. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the figure's appearance reweights options. Cost is legible in "the ache's exact coordinate," and orientation is clear early. The mosaic pattern is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cavern orchard and glass eyes constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "stalactites answer in tiny decimal pauses," integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding emotion through loss escalates via accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency in using the glass eyes and humming. Cost is unmistakable in the "patient recognition" fruit, foreclosing resolution with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and emotional mathematics emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the chalk-and-salt fruit. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "the orchard leans closer as if to grade us." Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and legible, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is integrated without muddle, e.g., "a figure made of refractions, inexact, tender." Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes conjuring, mathematics, and emotion with non-obvious specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
