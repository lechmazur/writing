<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt is embodied through concrete micro-choices, and the final decision to write the letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost in "tempered regret." Interiority avoids stock phrasing, and contradictions act in scene, such as the tension between professional complicity and personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from the watch hand to the driftwood discovery. Closure is a decisive change—writing the letter—with cost legible in "the silence there no longer felt empty but weighted like a scale." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the driftwood carvings and cobalt terrace pressure tactics. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "boards cool beneath my palms" and "brined alphabet," avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from investigating the watch hand to uncovering his own severed lineage. Cost is unmistakable in the discovery that he "proofread himself out of a family," tightening stakes through active sifting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of complicity and truth emerges through particulars like the watch hand and three leaves, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the map and facts, reweighting prior lies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "sieved hush" and "counterfeit shade." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "cast counterfeit shade" is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of black market genealogist is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like ledger lines and driftwood tallies. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
