<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's monthly personality molts are concretely embodied in micro-choices (e.g., "tonight I am firelight"), and Mara's consistent grit under pressure forges a relationship that charges the closure. Internal contradictions act in scene, such as the poet's shifting selves trusting Mara's steadfastness. The final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dawn purchase naming them "caretakers instead of thieves."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned images (e.g., "every knot is a stanza") to a resonant reconfiguration where the library "breathes plural verbs." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and closure lands with cost legible in the "receipt that names us caretakers." The moon timetable and patrol car pressure cohere without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: the rusted library's ivy and rebar are welded into the rebuild, altering tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "luminous fracture of reflected stars"). The coffee tin and seeds function as micro-settings that charge the final image of "blooming resistance." Spatial choreography remains clear despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase—patrol car prowls tighten pressure, and community help deepens stakes. Protagonist agency drives the rebuild, with cost visible in the dawn nail purchase. The dominant stake (resisting condemnation) is tested meaningfully, though the patrol car threat resolves without full confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coffee tin's hidden poems and the act of "welding green and rust." Subtext operates in gestures (Mara's silent remembrance of her cell). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the library naming itself, avoiding moralizing. The "blooming resistance" concept integrates without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "my skull molts personalities"). Poetic syntax and rhythm modulate under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural ("whispering meter to calm my ribs"), and elision (e.g., prison backstory) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with varied sentence rhythms that accelerate during rebuild beats. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "vines will scribe green cursive"). Minor template cadence in adjacent "We stack crates..." lines slightly dulls momentum, but no artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of vagrant poet and library resistance, with fresh inflections like personality molting constraining choice. The premise avoids cliché through specific, lived detail (e.g., prison library friendship). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
