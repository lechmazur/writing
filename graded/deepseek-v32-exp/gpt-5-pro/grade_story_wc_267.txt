<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied interiority (e.g., nerve regeneration burning like starlight). Micro-choices under pressure, such as handling the bolt, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final decision to not fully tighten the bolt is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Bellhop's silent presence applies secondary pressure, enhancing the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the bolt is half-turned, reconfiguring silence with cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Causality is tight, with the bolt decision arising from established pattern. Cost is legible in the final image: "a way for sound to return if courage arrived."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cobalt fortress and snowy atmosphere filtering POV. The staircase discoloration and bolt constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action (e.g., "snow steamed from travelers"). Environmental mirroring of internal states avoids overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of safety vs. silence) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency. The bolt decision narrows options and forces a trade-off with visible cost. Pressure coheres from arrival to climax, with no coincidence. Final choice reweights stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence and safety emerges through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (e.g., bellhop's signed communication). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "safety which murders testimony is an unpardonable silence." No moralizing; complexity lingers with frostbitten hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet grounded in character's experience. Elision (e.g., silent communication) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "nerve regeneration that wrote lightning under my skin"). Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, but clarity remains in peak beats. Propulsion is strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of silence, trauma, and safety feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices (e.g., nerve regeneration as a live constraint). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, anchored in particulars.</comment>
