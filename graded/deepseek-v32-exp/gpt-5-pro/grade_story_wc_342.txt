<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the coin) is earned with visible cost, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the transformed room and artist's departure. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early and constraints (coin map) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the tree trunk library and coin constraining choices and charging the final image. Economy of detail supports atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with stakes tightening via the impending demolition and artistic process. Cost is legible in the room's transformation, though pressure is more atmospheric than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, exploring memory and limits without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the room as a "portrait of days before faces."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature (noticing ceilings over faces) and consistent lyrical voice. Rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is flawlessly crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and purposeful figurative language. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; closure image is sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of face-blind artist and sky-painting concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specificity in details like the coin map avoids template plots.</comment>
