<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing ferryman rope onto shard). Final commitment to walk with teams is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong; closure is Charged Poise with felt cost in envoys' "new gravity" and protagonist's steady walk. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (ice floes, crystal ball) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse orchard, ice floes) pressures choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "floes scraped and parted like arguments."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency with the globe, leading to envoys' promises; cost is legible in their bowed heads and protagonist's commitment to ensure actions follow words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy mapped to action emerges organically from events (crystal ball, mirrors); ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as in the globe's projection of "remembered efforts."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent, e.g., "shadow-laced peacekeeper," and elision (mirror glimpses) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, though slightly ornate in peaks, e.g., "ice below rehearsed its slow departure."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (lighthouse orchard, crystal ball, vintage mirrors) feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth is high.</comment>
