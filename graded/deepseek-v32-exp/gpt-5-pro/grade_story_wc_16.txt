<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to restore trust is clear and intensifies through vows; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion; relationship dynamics force meaningful changes; final reconciliation earned with visible cost in confessed drift and promises.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with unsnarling the knot and translating the codex, cost legible in repaired laughter and vows; causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages; orientation anchored early in archive setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive setting constrains choices via vow-based door mechanism; glass ink well recurs with reweighted meaning, charging the final image; sensory details like "dust like a choir of hush" are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring trust escalates through vow-writing, narrowing options and changing knowledge; agency drives tightening under causal lens; cost unmistakable in confessions and promises that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected promises emerges from vows and door mechanism, not statement; subtext in objects like ink well; ending reweights prior material without moralizing, e.g., "language of we is a grammar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature in phrases like "choir of hush"; dialogue natural and goal-driven; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language coherent and purposeful, e.g., "like a metronome on our impatience"; no loops or scaffold; propulsion supports scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of language archives with vow-based mechanics; specific details like ink well and grandmother's history avoid templates; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
