<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as using the sextant to aim light. However, no significant internal conflict or flaws complicate her actions, limiting depth. The final choice to resurrect the fountain feels earned but lacks contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost in the fountain's revival and Mara's reflection, under an Accumulative lens that tightens through detail density. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The final image reconfigures hope through practical action with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, constraining choices like using carnival leftovers and the sextant. The terminal's decay pressures Mara's actions, and the environment charges the final image with the fountain's whispers and light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her incremental repairs. The stake in rebuilding hope tightens through redirection flows, but external conflict is minimal, relying on internal momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as water learning to move, offering a non-literal answer to hope. Subtext in gestures like the boy's nod deepens resonance without moralizing, though some lines verge on explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmic, with a perceptual signature that reflects Mara's engineer mindset. POV is stable and elision is purposeful, as in the sextant's click echoing new orbits. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or artifacts. Figurative language is controlled, though slight purple tinge in peaks like "bone cold of metals" doesn't harm clarity. Propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of spaceport, carnival, and engineer feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in lyric density. Turns are earned through character choice, but the premise isn't radically transformative, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>
