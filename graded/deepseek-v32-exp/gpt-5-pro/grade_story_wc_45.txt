<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's forgiving skepticism is deeply embodied and drives key choices; internal conflict between doubt and hope is rendered in scene with concrete micro-choices, such as following the trail and setting the fox's leg. The final renunciation of pure logic for listening is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the apology to the father. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression is realistic and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly from inciting incident to closure; the discovery of the substitute body leads through because/therefore linkages to the garden and boy's return. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the protagonist's admission of past error and the father's weeping. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the protagonist's doubt shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "whisper of rushes" and "tree-knuckle rafters" filtering through the bonesetter's POV. The secret garden and hedge maze constrain choices and supply the root-boned map, directly charging the final image of repair. Micro-setting elements like the tooth and bone-setting tools are integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding the boy escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from examining the decoy to using the tooth as a key. Cost is legible in the protagonist's altered stance and the father's emotional payment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sap map is revealed, forcing a trade-off and deepening the mystery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of doubt and forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like bone setting as conversation and the garden's borrowing of children. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the protagonist's renewed skepticism, reweighting prior mistakes without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as Mara pressing the tooth into the palm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending clinical observation ("measuring eye") with poetic reflection ("cleft in certainty"). Diction and syntax reflect the bonesetter's professional and emotional biases, and purposeful compression (e.g., "the ground tipped") enhances rhythm without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "Bone setting is a conversation, I told the boy, and apologies are too"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; word choice is specific and voice-motivated. Closure image is sharp and unburdened by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore and psychological realism feels inevitable, with specific details like the changeling's tooth and bone setting transforming tropes through grounded character choices. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise of a "forgiving skeptic" is fully committed to its implications.</comment>
