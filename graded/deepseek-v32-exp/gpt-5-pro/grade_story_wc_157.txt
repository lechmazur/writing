<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with contradictory impulses, such as the narrator's defiance and guardianship, earning the final choice to continue. Ilya's rogue scholar traits are shown through actions like introducing the gourd rattle seed, creating key turns. Micro-choices under pressure, like annotating the Notice with stems, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the collectors' retreat and the realization of "the math," reweighting the premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The mosaic structure with shards (greenhouse, gardens) is taught early and coheres, with transitions that maintain pressure. No orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, such as the greenhouse's low heaters discouraging microphones and the gardens shaping message patterns. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "wet soil secrets" and "moths rehearsed on the glass," reflecting the POV's priorities and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from planting patterns to facing the Bureau's audit, with cost unmistakable in the Notice of Arrears and the smudged ellipsis. The dominant stake of defiance tightens through meaningful deepening, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the marigolds spelling "WAIT" and the final pollen payment, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to resistance. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the ants smudging the Notice into an ellipsis, without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evidenced by rhythmic control in lines like "candidly cryptic clatter of jars." Dialogue, such as Ilya's cryptic register, is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without head-hopping. Purposeful elision in the mosaic structure is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold, as in "the air turned cashier, folding every stray idea into ledgers." Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. No artifacts obscure causality or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes the premise of taxable thoughts with secret language through gardening, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the specific details like the gourd rattle seed transform familiar resistance tropes.</comment>
