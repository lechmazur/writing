<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivo's claustrophobia and motivation to "stand by the unremembered" are consistently embodied through micro-choices like slow breathing and using the electroscope, with internal conflict between fear and duty driving the vigil. His final renunciation of data ownership forecloses a path with visible cost, earned by prior causality. The attribute "tracks invisible things" is integrated into action, constraining his methods under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ivo's vigil crystallizes his commitment to return, with cost legible in the tidal threat and whispered promise. Under the accumulative/textural lens, pattern density increases through sensory details and cable hum, holding coherence. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending reweights absence with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the tidal timeframe forcing tactical urgency and the facility's decaying state shaping Ivo's actions. Sensory details like "caves breathed like lungs" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description. The electroscope and cables function as micro-settings that alter options and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Ivo's agency with the electroscope and phase transitions, tightening under the tidal clock. The stake of remembering the forgotten deepens through retrieved signals, with cost visible in the rising water threat. However, the pressure relies slightly on atmospheric accumulation over causal turns, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance emerges through particulars like the cables "crooning interference and loss" and the final act of speaking names, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like setting mugs for absent colleagues, resisting abstraction. The ending reweights prior material through the conceptual repricing of silence and duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable close third-person with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in Ivo's professional attention to currents and hums. Voice is consistently poetic yet grounded, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., phased transitions) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with figurative language like "secret tongue" serving pressure without muddle. No loops or scaffold issues; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "shimmer of attention") slightly reduces clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic spelunker with undersea cables and phase transitions feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image of "small vigil" riding cables is singular and coherent. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
