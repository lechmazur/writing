<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied (e.g., "lotus-hearted ache"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding which truths to fold, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Final renunciation (not saying everything) is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with mist-clad atrium and hospital setting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered decoding and imagery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the translator achieves peace with cost legible in the "lotus-hearted ache" and the glow of the "strange inland moon."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the atrium, brain coral, and cast functioning as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting POV bias (e.g., fog and palms mirror internal states).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Sifa's safety and resolution of shared anxieties) escalates through protagonist agency in decoding the cast and negotiating. Cost is legible in the emotional weight and the agreement, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (translation as graft, meaning from wounds) emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in coded messages and translator's choices. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats (e.g., "tide has turned the vowels into reefs").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of conflict-zone translation and decoding, transformed through specific details like the brain coral and cast. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
