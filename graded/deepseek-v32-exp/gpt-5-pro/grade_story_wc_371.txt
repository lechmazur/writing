<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to leave the path visible is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the threat of officials. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as admitting delays while seeking sacredness, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the pocketed shell symbolizes renewal, with cost legible in "winter hardens everything." Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation clear early. Persistent constraint of urban change shapes tactics, and causality is tight within the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the tea house uncloaking guides actions, and the path of shells alters tactics. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment evolving consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding sacred in ordinary) escalates under accumulative lens through agency-driven actions like uncloaking and sharing bread. Cost is unmistakable in confessions and the risk of discovery. Pressure tightens meaningfully, though no major reversals are needed in this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the bread ritual and uncloaking, with subtext in gestures. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "action and attention stay married," avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experiences, lending complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "every scratch on a lintel reports." Voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is purposeful and consistent. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and propulsion, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and transformative, synthesizing guerrilla gardening with urban renewal in a non-obvious way. Specific details like the vanished bakery bread create irreplaceability. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
