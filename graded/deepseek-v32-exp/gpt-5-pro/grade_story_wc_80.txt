<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., placing notes) revealing a hierarchy of values. Motivation intensifies from measurement to archeology of dreams, earning the final resonant reconfiguration. Slight lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the city "acknowledge[s]" the protagonist's joining of memory, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the tide's mind acting as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., tide drops offering a "breathing hour") and charges the final image with algae "like patient pennants." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the surveyor's professional bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with placing notes intensifying the stake in memory preservation. Cost is legible in the "quiet oath sealed under grit," though the internal conflict lacks a sharp turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence emerges through particulars like the inkwell and pavilion arches, with the ending offering a non-literal answer via the "listening notation" image. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "columns rise from water like interrupted thoughts"). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., "S.G.") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "algae flutter like patient pennants," and propulsion accelerates toward closure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surveyor precision with lyrical memory work feels inevitable, transforming the trope of decay. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, supported by specific details like the inkwell's initials.</comment>
