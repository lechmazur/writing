<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions like trembling that tighten resolve. Micro-choices, such as decoding the envelope, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The shift from "dappled resolve" to "steadier heartbeat" is earned through causal actions, with visible cost in the council's acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly, with events linked through the envelope clue leading to the gate solution. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the valley harmonizes and the machinist learns—anchored in the final image of "machinery and mercy kept time." Orientation is clear early, and the chain constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the amphitheater's breath actively constraining choices like the gate schedule. Sensory details (e.g., "warm draft," "quiver against my wrist") are filtered through POV, and the environment charges the final image of dust freckling cheeks as the valley listens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing values before disaster—escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens, from decoding the pattern to testing gates. Cost is legible in the council's relief and the farmer's nod, foreclosing conflict with a trade-off that balances drains and songs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from events like decoding the adhesive, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "a slyly heartfelt metronome," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the elder's wariness softening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("stone lung," "fossilized waves") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., council arguments), and elision (e.g., mentor's message) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and rhythmic control, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language (e.g., "arguments turned to ash") is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence variety supports momentum, and the final line resonates with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes engineering and mysticism with non-obvious ingenuity, transforming tropes through specific details like the adhesive analysis. Emotional truth anchors risk-taking, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight. The element integration is organic, not checklist-driven, with bold choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
