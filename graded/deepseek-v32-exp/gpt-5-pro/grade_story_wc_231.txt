<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Old Partial's motivation to decode the gesture is rooted in consistent traits (trusting absence), with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to keep signaling is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his witnessed isolation. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and patterns to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the keeper's role is reconfigured with cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image of unthreading sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (lighthouse, opal dock, mist) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The environment pressures tactics, such as using the light to signal, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in investigating gaps, leading to a meaningful tightening where the light signals convey the message. Cost is legible in the keeper's continued isolation and the borrowed memories ripening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence and communication emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the closing motion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the keeper's role as lantern and harbor, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "borrowed memories") taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language (e.g., "lighthouse breathe its tired white lung") is coherent and voice-motivated, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and Edelweiss feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the light signals transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
