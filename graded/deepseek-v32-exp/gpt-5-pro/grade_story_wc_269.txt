<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like tapping rhythms. Micro-choices under pressure, such as assembling notes and communicating with Jun, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to mark the path anew is earned by prior causality with visible cost in community action. Emotional progression is realistic, with contradictions between past and present handled embodiedly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the nodal cycle revelation leading to community action). Cost is legible in the ending image of "assembling a future that can wait." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of investigation pays off at closure. No causality breaks; the lens is consistent and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the sea level station and flats pressure tactics like measuring tides and marking paths. Sensory details are vivid and selective (e.g., "silted shoes," "gulls heckle"), integrated into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment evolving causally through the nodal cycle discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the discovery of the nodal cycle tightening stakes and leading to community action. Cost is legible in the on-page trade-offs, such as flexible beacons and the bell installation. Dominant stake (understanding path disappearance) is signaled early and deepens through investigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like tapping rhythms and the atlas page, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to path disappearance without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the mother's steps in the taps. Ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost in "the moon remembers to widen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, reflective prose. Dialogue with Jun is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in tapping patterns. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "the sea speak softly inside it"). Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing environmental issues with personal history in a non-obvious way, transforming tropes through specific details like the nodal cycle. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
