<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's curiosity and bravery are consistently embodied through micro-choices like uncaging the water despite guild warnings. Interiority is concrete, with trembling hands and stomach drops under pressure, and the final release of the echo is earned by prior causality. The pendant's time-borrowing adds a layer of internal conflict, with cost legible in the giant's shift and repaid seconds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the watcher's nod accepts the echo's release, reconfiguring stakes without reprimand. The Hybrid drive lens holds, with causal actions (uncaging water) and accumulative texture building to a cost: the giant's twitch and borrowed time due. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pendant's constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the rooftop canal system and sleeping giant pressuring choices—the canal-rim climb and sluice gate manipulation alter tactics. Sensory details like "sluice gates whisper" and "air syrup-thickens" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The pendant and tiles charge the closure by completing the pattern, constraining the echo's birth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meddling vs. waking the giant) escalates under the Hybrid lens through protagonist agency: uncaging water causes the interrupted cadence and echo birth. Cost is unmistakable in the giant's shift and the pending repayment of borrowed time. The watcher's appearance tightens options, but resolution is earned by the release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: curiosity, time, and creation are explored through the echo's birth and release, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the watcher's comment on species living "across a giant's nap." Subtext in the pendant's ethics and borrowed time deepens the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, observational voice that reflects the illustrator's profession. Perceptual signature is strong in lines like "my pencil listen before it moves," and dialogue with the watcher is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., time borrowing) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "The air syrup-thickens; drops hang bright as beads." No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Closure image is sharp, with clear propulsion and no artifacts obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements: echoes born from interrupted cadence, time-sculpting pendant, and giant-sleep metaphysics. Risk-taking in lyric prose and conceptual integrity heightens stakes without gimmickry. The echo's release feels inevitable, transforming familiar curiosity tropes through specific world logic.</comment>
