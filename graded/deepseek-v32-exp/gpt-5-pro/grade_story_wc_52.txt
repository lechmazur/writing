<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as carving the cage to manage grief. Contradictory impulses of loss and practicality are shown in scene, and her final stance is earned through prior causality. The wrist ache from an old break concretizes emotion, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with cost in "He is here and gone, and she is here and going," reconfiguring grief through the carved cage. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of memory shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The loft and rain-beaded skylight create a micro-setting that pressures choices, such as the carving bench constraining action. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the "dry and green" scent of ash. The environment charges the final image of peace, integral to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Rain's agency in the carving ritual, tightening through density increases like the sugar crystal's inclusion. Cost is legible in her renunciation of trapping memory, foreclosing a path with visible trade-offs. The kettle's boil acts as a live clock that alters moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images like the cage and sugar crystal, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the door left ajar, implying openness. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with poetic rhythm and controlled syntax under pressure. POV is stable and single, with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression, like "unfinished thunder," enhances texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "tea clouds the cup like tigers pacing in fog." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of lion tamer's widow and ash wood carving offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief and craft. Emotional truth is specific and transformative, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in character particulars.</comment>
