<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal values. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped, lacking simultaneous impulses in scene, preventing a higher score. The final choice to expose the truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the siren blast and community awakening reconfigure stakes, under a Hybrid lens blending causal and accumulative elements. The sundial as a persistent constraint shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the canal environment constrains choices by hiding secrets. The sundial charges the final image as a verdict, integrating setting into action and theme without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through narrator's agency, from investigation to confrontation, with cost legible in the foreman's lowered stance and community response. One meaningful tightening under the Hybrid lens drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges organically through images like the sundial's shadow, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the watchman's empty palms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is selective and biased, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of truth-seeking with unique elements like the sundial as compass, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the final image feels inevitable.</comment>
