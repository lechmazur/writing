<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits as a love letter ghostwriter, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., "the cloudburst peeled away my composure"). The final choice to build the art installation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost in the silent reunion. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the shared silence and the image of the "thread that connects all things." Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout via motifs (nest, ribbon, letters) that intensify meaning. Orientation is clear early, and causality is coherent from storm to temple to installation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "water is a mirror filled with green light") that reflect POV bias. The temple environment constrains choice by enabling the art installation, and the nest/ribbon object charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the decision to build the spiral deepens stakes and leads to the reunion. Cost is legible on-page in the public sharing of letters and the silent, charged moment. Dominant stake (longing to reconnect) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection and secrecy emerges organically from events and images (e.g., letters, spiral, ribbon), with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "thread that connects all things," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Diction and syntax reflect the narrator's worldview (e.g., "keeper of secrets with ink on my fingers"). Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is purposeful, taught, and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dragonflies stitch the edges"), enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a love letter ghostwriter creating public art is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (thrush's nest, crimson ribbon) transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
