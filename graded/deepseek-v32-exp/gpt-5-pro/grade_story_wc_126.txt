<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find beauty in the unfinished is clear and consistent, driving key choices like initiating the bonfire and refusing perfection. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions shown through actions like tuning to leaks. However, minor lack of internal contradiction limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (chronic hush learns to listen) with felt cost on page ("the hush loosen as if a knot has learned the shape of her hands"). Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern build-up to community healing. Orientation is clear early, and transitions are legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—e.g., shipwrecks encircle the cove, influencing the bonfire location. Sensory details like "glass ribs jeweled with salt" are purposeful. The greenhouse and ship ribs constrain tactics and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming chronic hush) escalates through Mara's agency, like inviting errors and the bonfire tradition. Cost is legible when "the chronic hush tightens, then cracks." Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the unfinished emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the mendicant's bowl catching sound. Ending offers a non-literal answer through the bell's "cracked honey" note, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited focused on Mara, with a purposeful shift to "we" at the end. Voice is distinct and poetic, with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though minor register consistency questions arise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion—e.g., "the sea answers with a syllable, almost a word." No loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements—acoustic perception in a post-apocalyptic setting—feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the sunken orchard avoid template plots.</comment>
