<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to discover the color of sound is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., descending to the ship) leading to an earned change from hiding to offering vows. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost as the protagonist experiences a new color of sound, reconfiguring truth from a wall to an open door. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the key tag as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the sunken library constraining choice and charging the final image through sensory details like "water changed sound" and algae-lit spines. Micro-setting (key tag) integrates into action, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (e.g., using the key tag), with cost legible in the shift from truth as shield to path. One meaningful tightening occurs as the offering forecloses hiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth and perception emerges through images and events, with subtext in vows and key tag; ending offers a non-literal answer via the color of sound walking through an open door, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature is strong in lines like "listened for the sea's color," and elision (e.g., ship's history) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "silence that hums like a closed mouth" is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lamplighter and sound color discovery with non-obvious ingenuity; key tag as tuning plate transforms tropes, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
