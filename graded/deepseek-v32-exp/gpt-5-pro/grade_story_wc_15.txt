<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure, such as sewing the seam open, revealing embodied emotion and internal conflict. The final choice to create the book is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a conceptual repricing as the lighthouse shines inward, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The sleepwalking paths and labyrinth mechanics cohere, and the cost is legible in the protagonist's effort and the town's renewed hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "salt, ochre, and bygone prayers" and the labyrinth's stone shaping tactics. The environment is integral to the narrative arc, pressing the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the labyrinth journey and the act of sewing.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the lighthouse without a lamp representing a promise, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, deepening resonance through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in lines like "the labyrinth is not a puzzle but a choir." Voice modulates with pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts harming clarity. Figurative language, such as "an orchid solace unfolding," is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting may occur in peak beats.</comment>
