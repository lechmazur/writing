<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final vow fulfillment feels earned, and Sura adds relational pressure. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the final image of music as a verb. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of silence-to-music transformation pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as frost drawing staves and glass reacting to emotion. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes in translating silence escalate through protagonist's agency, with cost legible in performances and the bell scene. Escalation is driven by heat-mapping and emotional shifts, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, offering a non-literal answer to silence and music. Subtext in gestures like Sura's tracing avoids moralizing, and the final reconfiguration resonates without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., silence) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes silence and music in a fresh, non-obvious way, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes. Specific details like the tuning fork case feel inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
