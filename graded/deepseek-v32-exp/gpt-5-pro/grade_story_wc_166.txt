<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion (e.g., "exile tastes like brine swallowed in winter"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the moonstone on the tongue, reveal a hierarchy of values. The watcher's change is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his decision to accept exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the shared harbor opens "no law can close," with cost legible in the watcher's hesitation and the protagonist's risk. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks in the dance reweighting stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (twilight garden) constrains choices by providing a space where "enforcement drones refuse to look," and it charges the final image with pools that "pool the sky." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "gravel remembers shoreline," filtered through POV bias. The garden acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against forgetting) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in the dance and the watcher's confrontation. Protagonist agency drives the tightening, with cost visible in the watcher's question "if forgetting can be gentle." The choice to share the poem forecloses options and reweights stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through art emerges from events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like "showing him how my soles hold the stones." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "harbor no law can close," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "each step charting invisible currents"). Voice is consistent and poetic, modulating under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as in the watcher's inquiry about harm. Elision in gaps is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in dense metaphors (e.g., "swinging a planet by a strand of hair") may mildy obscure clarity in peak beats. No major artifacts or loops; sentences advance story and atmosphere with purpose. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of tide dancing and nostalgia ban, with specifics like the moonstone instrument feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world, resisting template plots.</comment>
