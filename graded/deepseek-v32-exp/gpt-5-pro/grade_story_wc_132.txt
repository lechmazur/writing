<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's shift from control to stewardship is earned through embodied micro-choices under pressure, such as observing the leaf and altering irrigation. Internal conflict is concrete, with no diagnostic self-awareness. Theo applies secondary pressure, and the final renunciation of control carries visible cost in changed practices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts change. Orientation is clear by "the morning smelled like wet limestone." Cost is legible in the final image of the leaf with fern spores, and the lens coherence supports the ending's charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the mossy trellis and linden leaf dictate irrigation changes and embody transformation. Sensory details like "damp rib cage" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from leaf observations to storm-induced release of control. Cost is unmistakable in reconstructed beds and lost customers. Dominant stake of control vs. nature tightens meaningfully with each beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through particulars like the leaf's journey and trellis's resilience, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "life drifts by invitations instead of orders." Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature, with lyrical syntax reflecting the narrator's mindset. Voice remains stable under pressure, and elision (e.g., Theo's sketches) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction is character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "listening ear" is coherent and purposeful. Sentences advance story without muddle, and closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nature and control feels inevitable, with specific details like fern spores as passengers. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation is grounded in character and setting particulars.</comment>
