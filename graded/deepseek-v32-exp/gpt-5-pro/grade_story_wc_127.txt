<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dealer's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as handling the blotter petal with sparked fingertips. Liora is distinct, and their interaction reveals hierarchical values. No stock phrases or unearned epiphanies; final choice is earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora steadies herself, with cost legible in her tears and thanks. Orientation anchored early; static electricity constrains tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber grotto setting pressures choices through static electricity and sensory details like "resinous stone hummed." Micro-setting (blotter petal, electrodes) charges the final image. POV filter selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Liora's courage to handle grief) escalates under Accumulative lens through dealer's agency, leading to transformation with cost in "tears smelled of salt and vetiver." One meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths as bridges emerges from events and images, not statement; subtext in gestures like the blotter petal. Ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice poetic but consistent, modulating under pressure. Dialogue natural and goal-driven, as in "Subsume nothing... let us channel, not drown."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "limestone consonants fusing with amber vowels") slightly dampens peak clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise of emotion dealer and static electricity sensing offers fresh synthesis; risk-taking in style heightens stakes. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
