<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, no contradictory impulses act in scene, and the final choice, while earned, lacks visible internal conflict, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (reprieve and light welcoming), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with persistent constraints shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the pane of hush and puppet head constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the ritual sequence tightening stakes and cost legible in the effort and reprieve. One meaningful deepening reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy and time emerges through images and events, not direct statement, with subtext in gesture and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and clear, enhancing propulsion without muddle in peak beats, and read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic, with specific details (pane of hush, puppet head) transforming familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
