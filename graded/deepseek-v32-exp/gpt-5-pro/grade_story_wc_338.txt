<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrator's methodical curiosity and empathetic motivation are consistently embodied through micro-choices, such as not forcing the door, with the final renunciation of force earned by prior causality and visible cost in respectful handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the narrator leaves the chapel open, reweighting silence with empathy under an accumulative/textural lens; cost is legible in the promise to "reopen their doors slowly."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting elements like the salt-warped map and limestone door constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details (e.g., "damp air breathed through the seam") are selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the narrator's agency under the accumulative lens, from investigating the tear to comparing videos, with cost felt in the careful, patient approach that forecloses forceful options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of interpreting silence with empathy emerges organically from particulars like the torn map and whispered chapel, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "a throat withholding a name"; elision (e.g., silent videos) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "stones like worn teeth") is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maps, silence, and gentleness feels inevitable; specific details (pollen maps, silent footage) and risk-taking in quiet closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
