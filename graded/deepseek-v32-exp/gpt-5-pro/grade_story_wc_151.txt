<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and driven by a specific philosophy ("discover meaning in the margins"), with embodied emotion ("My throat tightens") and micro-choices under pressure (redrawing chalk codes). Mira's brief characterization effectively reveals her anxiety through action ("pinching a letter so hard the stamp looks bruised"), but her depth is limited, preventing a higher score. The final choice to pause mailing is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a charged poise—the pause before mailing reconfigures meaning and stakes, with cost legible in the risk to Mira's safety. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the chalk code sequence and margin realization. The structure is a single, coherent scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The golden arcade and chalk codes constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid, purposeful sensory details ("like a mouth full of coins," "faint perfume of gum arabic"). Setting is filtered through the narrator's professional bias, integrating into action (e.g., redrawing chalk to alter margins). The environment shapes tactics and supports the theme of hidden meanings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's safety) escalates under the accumulative lens through density increase—the discovery of margin scanners forces the narrator's agency in redrawing chalk and creating decoys. Cost is legible in the danger of exposure, and the resolution is earned by the protagonist's alteration of tactics. One meaningful tightening (realization about scanners) forecloses options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and memory emerges through particulars (chalk codes, margins, pseudonyms) without direct statement, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final promise ("find the right name at last"). Subtext operates in implication (e.g., Oona's message in the margins). The ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, observational voice ("futuristic nostalgia of this place") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("Help me choose a safer self"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., chalk code mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("golden arcade at dawn catches the old city light like a mouth full of coins"). Syntax varies to support pressure, and closure image is clear. Read-aloud ear test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a pseudonym creator in a futuristic nostalgia setting is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis, transformed through specific details (chalk codes, margin scanning). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality rooted in character and world logic.</comment>
