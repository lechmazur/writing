<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (e.g., thermal bloom of longing) and micro-choices under pressure (following sorrow) that reveal values. Final choice to broadcast the chord is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the act of sharing. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the fossil alignment and broadcast, reweighting communication with sleepers with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with sensory details escalating to discovery. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (fossil as bridge) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., passage tightening forces skimming on back). Sensory details (salt, plankton light) are purposeful and charged in the final image. The cave network and fossil function as micro-settings that alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to voice the unknown) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (following sorrow, discovering fossil). Cost is legible in the broadcast decision, which forecloses other paths. One meaningful tightening deepens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of communication and reconnection emerges through images and events (fossils as transitional objects, mapping silence). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the chord as invitation enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (sensory bias, poetic diction). Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., drifting sequence) without head-hopping. Purposeful elision (e.g., floating) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats (e.g., "chord like a gently opened door"). Read-aloud flow is smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (sensory mapping, hibernation world) with specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded details (elm fossil, heat-mapping). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
