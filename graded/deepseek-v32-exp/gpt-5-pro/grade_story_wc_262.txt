<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. The protagonist's micro-choices, like cradling the film strip, reveal values under pressure, and the final harvesting action is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the blank leader glowing and envelope warming. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the film strip shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the projection booth and film strip constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in harvesting the clear leader. Stakes tighten meaningfully through the psychometry reading and final action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unused love emerges through images and events, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the blank leader reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. Diction and rhythm heighten emotional beats without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing crystal gazing with film storage; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details and transformation of tropes create inevitability.</comment>
