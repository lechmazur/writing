<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is deeply rooted in debt and reluctance, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses (resentment vs. duty) act in scene, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost, such as "empties me of myself."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Earned Stasis, as the caretaker endures his duty, foreclosing escape with cost ("leaving myself behind"). The causal lens holds, with persistent constraints (curse, birds) shaping tactics, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (birds force stealthy guidance) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as "brass feathers ticking" and "frost soon."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with pressure from birds and time narrowing options. Cost is legible in the climax, such as using the nut to pause a bird and the caretaker's self-emptying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (duty, sacrifice) emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the nut and guidance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., guidance methods) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "graceless beauty," and propulsion is clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of cursed orchard and mechanical birds, transformed through specific details and emotional truth. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
