<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to recharter the echo is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the corridor healing and burden lightening. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: the corridor closes "like healed skin" and legacy's burden feels lighter. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through sensory patterns. Orientation is anchored early, and the cost is legible in the final image, shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ivy-veiled passage and tiles constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "footsteps bloomed where nothing moved." Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from discovering diaries to rechartering the echo, narrowing options with cost. Dominant stake (legacy's burden) tightens meaningfully, and the final trade-off (letting go of the drowning man) forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the film negative and echoes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to legacy and healing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, e.g., "maps must learn to comfort as they guide," without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "silence carries more roads than noise." Purposeful elision (e.g., the man on the stairs) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "footsteps bloomed," without muddle. Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("I asked... I whispered") but no closure obscurity. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing echo cartography with climate shifts and legacy. Tropes are transformed through specific details, e.g., the film negative as lens and tuning fork. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
