<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Android's motivation to resolve inner static is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "inner static that asks the same unfinished question." Final escape choice earned by prior causality, though minor abstraction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the dome collapses and the android steps out, inner hiss loosening. Accumulative lens holds through imagery and pattern; magnetic shift forces action, and cost is legible in "the dome sighs, then slumps."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: glass dome and magnetic shift pressure choices, charging the final image of burial in revised geography. Sensory details like "smoke twines up spirals" are selective and purposeful, integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: magnetic shift tightens pressure, leading to controlled burn and escape with agency. Cost is visible in dome's loss and inner change, though one minor tightening prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges from events like the burn and escape, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the box of fears and inner static deepens resonance, integrated through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person android with distinct perceptual signature: poetic, reflective voice controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; elision like childhood fears is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "flames travel like careful handwriting," and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis: android caretaker with non-human nostalgia, controlled burn as escape. Specific details like magnetic shift and desert roses transform tropes; risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
