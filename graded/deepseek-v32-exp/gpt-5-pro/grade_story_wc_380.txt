<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling his search for deleted memories. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like exhuming crystals. The final choice to bring crystals to the whale is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost. However, internal contradiction is subtle, lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration as memories return, costing the town's forgotten grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through images and patterns. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image of the exhaling harbor. Persistent constraint of gravity pockets shapes tactics and the final altar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the salt crystal chamber and harbor constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Ilya's POV. The environment pressures actions, such as crystals ringing only with careful touch, and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recovering memories escalates through Ilya's agency under the accumulative lens, from reading grounds to exhuming crystals. Cost is legible in the return of voices and the town's remembrance. A meaningful tightening occurs as gravity pockets shepherd him, narrowing options. No coincidental resolution, but escalation is more deepening than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and loss emerges implicitly from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the whale exhaling forgotten weather, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as salt listening better than machines. No moralizing or thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature reflecting Ilya's role. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., in the crystalline silence. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character lexicon, though minor register consistency could be sharper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "crystals hang like unfinished bells." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained in peak beats. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of memory, gravity, and salt crystals, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like coffee grounds and pressed wildflowers avoid template plots. Risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
