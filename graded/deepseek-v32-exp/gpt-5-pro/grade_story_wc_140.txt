The death certificate error survivor identity drives key turns, and the final endurance forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (teaching another to listen) that reweights options with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of layering fragments pays off at closure. No causality breaks; the final image charges prior material.</comment>
