<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., forgiveness steadying wrist); final choice to leave own hinge untouched shows earned endurance with cost; micro-choices reveal values consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost (pricked finger, slackened chains); hybrid drive lens holds without ambiguity; orientation is clear within first 120 words; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (vowstone requires thorn) and charges the final image (aurora writing on sky); sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist agency using key and thorn, narrowing options; cost is unmistakable in the pricked finger and unlinking, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of calibrated treason and forgiveness emerges from events and images without direct statement; ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material; subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates with pressure without head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens clarity; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of calibrated treason is a fresh synthesis; specific details (heritage rose thorn) feel inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
