<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., unfastening the painting) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to translate names is earned by prior causality, and interiority is concrete, though some emotions edge toward abstraction without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (elder wipes eyes, market shifts), under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the lighthouse lens fragment as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., the market's swinging aisles alter navigation). The lighthouse lens fragment, as a micro-setting object, constrains action and charges the final image, with sensory details woven purposefully into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using the fragment to uncover names, with cost legible in the elder's emotional response and market transformation. One meaningful tightening deepens the stake of honoring histories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (e.g., decoding hidden names) without direct statement, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, and syntax varies naturally to support rhythm without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of decoding hidden histories through a lens, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the concept organically.</comment>
