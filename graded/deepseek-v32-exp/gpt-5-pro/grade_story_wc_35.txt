<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique ability; interiority is vivid with embodied emotion (e.g., "my tongue already ached"); final choice to subsume grief is earned through prior causality with visible cost in the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost as grief is reconfigured; accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; orientation is clear early; persistent constraint of stored remorse shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with sensory details (e.g., "walls exhaled grit and petrichor") that pressure choices; coral pavilion constrains the climax and charges the final image with frost and whisper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming grief escalates through chef's agency (e.g., analyzing pools, cooking broth); cost is legible in the emotional reconfiguration; accumulative lens drives deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through subtext and imagery, not statement; ending offers resonant reweighting without moralizing (e.g., "grief had not vanished, but it fit").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is sharp (e.g., "tasted the siege"); rhythmic control under pressure; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats (e.g., "steam rose like banners after a siege").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of chef tasting memories is fresh and organic; emotional specificity avoids cliché; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
