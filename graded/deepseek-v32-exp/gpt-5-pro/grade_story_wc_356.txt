<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with consistent motivation; her olfactory sensitivity and ambition for serenity drive key choices, such as planting the seed on a swaying platform. The final revelation that the village learned to move as one is earned by her prior vigil and guidance, with cost felt in the community's initial flinch and subsequent collaboration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, as the flower's bloom teaches the village to breathe with the stench, reconfiguring motion and stillness. Cost is legible in the shared breath and changed perception, with the drive lens held consistently from early patterns of growth and patience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices; the treetop village's swaying bridges and platforms constrain Mara's tactics, and the flower platform charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, such as the "wildflower hush" and olfactory focus, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of cultivating serenity escalate through Mara's agency in planting the seed, keeping vigil, and guiding neighbors during storms. Cost is visible in the community's offended flinches and the eventual collaboration, with one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens as density increases toward the bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stillness within motion emerges organically from events and images, such as the corpse flower's rank smell revealing edges of breath. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with a non-literal answer at the end that reweights prior material without moralizing, as seen in the final image of "braided hands."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable single POV and rhythmic control under pressure; elision, such as the "turning of the tide's thought," is taught and paid off in closure. Perceptual signature is strong through olfactory focus, and diction remains within Mara's lexicon, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "nest sang softly," is consistent and enhances clarity without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of growth and community through specific choices, such as using a corpse flower to teach stillness; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with transformation of tropes through grounded detail.</comment>
