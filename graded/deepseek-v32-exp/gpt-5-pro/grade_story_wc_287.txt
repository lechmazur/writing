<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's wistful pragmatism is embodied through concrete actions like using the gauge tooth and hanging the net, with micro-choices revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority is character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final choice to instill light is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the effort and risk taken. No contradictory impulses in scene, but motivation is clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with the light softening the dark and reconfiguring the stairwell's atmosphere, costing the narrator's effort and risk. The drive lens holds, and the padlock constraint shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early with the harbor and fire escape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, such as the roof access via padlock and the harbor's light as a resource, charging the final image with the net's reflection. Sensory details are vivid and selective, like the "tar that keeps yesterday's sun" and the "quivering hush," filtered through the narrator's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from waiting for the petal drop to hanging the net, with cost legible in the physical effort and the transformation of the stairwell. The dominant stake of bringing light tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of light, memory, and community emerges through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in moments like Theo walking alone or Mrs. Gallo humming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "hush inside me becomes a harbor," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects the narrator's mindset, such as "rhythm of oars in water." No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the father's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and information-dense, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language, like "falls like a small boat released," is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the fire escape gardener concept with the lockmaster's tooth and light reflection feels inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
