<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism-minded archivist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Micro-choices, like drumming the cadence, reveal values and drive the narrative. The final decision to return is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the inverted hour ends.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when gravity reverts, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. The structure is coherent, with thresholds and turns that escalate pressure. Orientation is clear early, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto constrains choices, such as the hum unlocking slopes, and charges the final image with spores and tokens. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the archivist's POV. Spatial choreography is clear, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible when time hollows toward its end. The dominant stake of finding combinations tightens through thresholds and actions like drumming. Pressure coheres and deepens, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance emerges through particulars like seeds and tokens, not statement, with subtext in imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the archivist's plan to plant seeds in the catalog. Emotional aftereffect lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "prism-minded archivist." Voice modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; prose reflects the character's mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in dense figurative language exists but does not obscure closure. No loops or artifacts; sentence-level craft supports momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing elements like inverted gravity and vigilance seeds organically. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
