<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical actions; her interiority is embodied through specific details like shelving jars and using the brush, and her final choice to "keep faith" is earned by the night's accumulative proofs of kindness, with visible cost in her continued effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as an earned stasis under the accumulative lens, with Anya's practice reconfirmed through the night's interactions; the cost is legible in her vow to "keep rousing memory," and orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the greenhouse as a refuge from the smog-choked city charges the final image; sensory details like "saffron quiet" and "neon like exhausted fruit" are POV-filtered and purposeful, deepening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (proving kindness is remembered) escalate accumulatively through stranger interactions; Anya's agency in writing and offering tea drives each beat, with cost visible in the gifts left and her recorded ledger, tightening the theme under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images like the painted languages and returned gifts; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the "keep" glyph, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctly lyrical, with rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature is clear in Anya's noticing, and elision (e.g., brush mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and no loops or artifacts; figurative language like "moonlight pooled cleanly along its bristles like milk" is coherent and advances the story, maintaining clarity through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of lost languages, magical brush, and urban oasis; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative narrative heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
