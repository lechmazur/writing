<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Neris's characterization is deeply rooted in consistent traits as a defunct revolutionary and poetically inclined custodian, with interiority shown through embodied emotions like "burnished sorrow." Micro-choices under pressure, such as devising the calibration, reveal a hierarchy of values and compel higher-stakes choices. The final consideration of revolt feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Vark's grudging acceptance and Neris's personal renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the judge's verdict and Neris's reflective renewal, carrying felt cost in the grudging acceptance and emotional weight. The causal drive lens holds strong, with events linked through Neris's actions and the shard's revelations. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of visible time shapes tactics throughout, culminating in the storm's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "threads like bronze rain" and "gilt veins," constraining choices through elements like covering mirrors during storms. The environment pressures tactics and charges the final image, with the shard acting as a micro-setting that alters outcomes. Sensory selection reflects Neris's poetic bias, integrating detail into action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Neris's agency under the causal lens, from presenting the shard to the judge's decision, narrowing options and raising stakes. The cost is legible in Vark's thin smile and the open conservatory outcome, forcing a trade-off that forecloses quarrying. Dominant stake in reimagining civilization is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the dispute's resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the shard's scenes revealing transcendence over decadence, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Neris's writing and the asteroid's harmonies, reweighting prior material with complexity. Subtext operates in gestures like covering mirrors, and earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, filtering setting through Neris's revolutionary past and poetic inclination. Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and purposeful compression like "burnished sorrow" is taught and paid off. Dialogue natural and goal-driven, as in Vark's counters, carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "time strings itself like harp wires" is coherent and purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the storm, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes visible time, archaeological dispute, and poetic revolution with non-obvious ingenuity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth avoids generic templates. Specific details like the crystal vase shard transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
