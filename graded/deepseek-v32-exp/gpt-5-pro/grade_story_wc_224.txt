<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through offerings; interiority is embodied in specific perceptions (e.g., "memory grows teeth"); final choice to carry the feather and seed thresholds is earned with visible cost of relinquishing fear. The seer provides secondary pressure, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where home becomes a practice, with cost legible in the final image; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and revelations; orientation is clear early with mountain bookstore and painful memory; persistent constraint (offering fears) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "air weeps with hidden thunder") integrated into action; labyrinthine bookstore constrains choices (corridors braid, staircases loop) and charges the final image (mountain reshapes a room); micro-setting alters tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) escalates through protagonist's agency (offering fears, using feather); one meaningful tightening occurs when the stone is read, foreclosing the path of fear with cost (paid for years without receipt); pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of home as practice emerges from events and images (e.g., stone's geometry, feather's texture); subtext operates in gestures (offering breath) and implication; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "every step writes a question my feet cannot read"); voice is poetic and rhythmic under pressure; dialogue with seer is natural and advances plot; no head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "substitutes reality") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "Letters lift as temperature, syntax as wind"); no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent in peak beats; clarity and propulsion are maintained, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious (bookstore as mountain, language stone); tropes are transformed through specific choices (e.g., reading via feather texture); synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
