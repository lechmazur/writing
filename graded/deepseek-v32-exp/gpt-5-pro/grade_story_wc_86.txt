<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., handling Daro's refusal) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—"I will keep choosing neutral territory"—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mothers' hard blinks. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between efficiency and careful listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost in the negotiator's commitment to stewardship, under an accumulative/textural lens. The persistent constraint of neutrality shapes tactics throughout, and orientation is clear within 120 words. The final image—"clicks like a small bell inside fog"—reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the parapet's neutral edge forces specific staging, and the antique drawer pull recurs with reweighted meaning. Sensory details (e.g., "mist thinning and thickening") are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when Daro refuses to step until named. Cost is legible in the paused apologies and the negotiator's intervention, narrowing options and forcing plain words without armor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the ledger and moon phases, offering a resonant answer to apology and forgiveness without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., Bram lifting ungloved palms) and the final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, measured rhythm under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Neris's apology), and elision (e.g., "recycle mistakes into wisdom") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("mist is a low chorus") is consistent and purposeful, and propulsion remains clear through peak beats like the prisoner crossings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (prisoner exchange) through specific details like moon-phase synchronization and the drawer pull's legacy. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable.</comment>
