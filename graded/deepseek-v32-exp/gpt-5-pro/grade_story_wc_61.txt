<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "share light without using fire" is deeply rooted and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices like rebuilding the orrery. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like "coax[ing] starlight through mineral lattices." The stranger's arrival introduces a credible relationship crucible that forces a micro-choice to teach, altering the garden's state. The final choice to "pledge to keep teaching transit as kindness" is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the reconfigured brightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the orrery's rebuilt gears enabling a "spiral of almost-closure." The cost is legible in the "fractur[ed]" expression of the stranger and the "old ache" of the protagonist, foreclosing escape-only traditions. Orientation is clear within ~120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, taught by the pattern of gentle light transmission. The persistent constraint of avoiding fire shapes tactics and the final image of "petals fall[ing] like soft applause."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nebula garden setting pressures choices through its "terraces of vapor" and "corridors of suspended pollen," constraining navigation via sonar and charging the final image with the "lagoon of tender darkness." Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through the protagonist's expertise, as in "roots threaded through star-silt." The calculating gear as a micro-setting object recurs with reweighted meaning in the orrery rebuild, altering options. Spatial choreography is coherent, with sonar pinging mapping "translucent moth-whales" and the stranger's arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation deepens through protagonist agency in trading histories and rebuilding the orrery, narrowing options from escape to shared transmission. The dominant stake of "shar[ing] light gently" is signaled early and reweighted with cost in the "reconfigured brightness" that teaches seedlings "to bear brightness without learning pain." A meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger's "troubling serenity" challenges the protagonist's methods, forcing a choice to collaborate. The cost is legible in the "pledge" that alters both characters' traditions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the gears meshing "cleanly" to symbolize transmission over repetition, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to generational grief. Subtext operates in gestures like the stranger's "bow without bowing" and the "listening skins" of seed-pods, implying quiet understanding. The final image of "petals fall[ing]" reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity in the "interval between them becom[ing] wide enough to plant trust." Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the "scorch and flight" history exchanged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "flowers breathed helium and quiet" and "sonar pinging through denser gas." Voice modulates under pressure, with rhythmic control in "a hush that lengthens each heartbeat." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as in the stranger's request to "teach her how to give light gently," carrying subtext of shared cost. Purposeful compression, like "time moves differently," is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences like "Moth-whales breach like muted fountains" advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "grief were pollen to be saved." Syntax accelerates with sonar "pulses gliding out" and breathes in quieter moments, maintaining momentum. Line-level craft is flawless, with precise word choice and clear sequence, supporting the closure image without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (gardener, stranger) with a fresh, non-obvious angle through the nebula garden and clockwork orrery, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, as in the "calculating machine gear" evolving into a symbol of transmission. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with particulars like "old tears dried into crystalline grains" creating authenticity. The core premise is transformed through lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus on grief and light.</comment>
