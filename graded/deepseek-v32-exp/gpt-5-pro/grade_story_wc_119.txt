<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with micro-choices under pressure. Secondary characters are lightly sketched but serve immediate pressure. The final orchestration feels earned, though some interiority lacks deep contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the group exhales, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds strong, with causality intact from Mei's actions to the revelation. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lighthouse lens and microdot specs constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (wind, beam, steam) are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes of revealing open secrets escalate through Mei's agency, leading to a collective exhale with visible cost. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though escalation is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets and transformation emerges through particulars without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of transposing life into a new key, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., fortune slips) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. No artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the dots blooming into sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fortune cookie writer, spycraft, and lighthouse feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible.</comment>
