<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., handling mentor's pouch, building coupling) revealing embodied emotion. The final choice to aim at "the space between swing and stillness" is earned by prior causality, and Sela adds secondary pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the city reimagined as "a receiver shaped like goodbye" and the map revealing preserved beginnings. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with causality driven by lunar perigee and tuning. Orientation is clear early; no outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail (e.g., "wind writes in loose wire," "creaking but unfallen") integrated into action. The radio tower city pressures tactics and supplies resources, shaping the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent; no generic placeholder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beginnings in endings) escalates under accumulative lens through lunar perigee and tuning, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the transformation and discovery of the cave. One meaningful tightening forecloses options; no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (e.g., beginnings in endings, discarding assumptions) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the instruction to "pour the beginnings into the endings." Subtext operates in gesture and implication; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., "data flows longer than walls"). Dialogue is minimal but natural; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "like a bell that measures courage instead of hours"). Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs; clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of celestial signals and fantasy elements, transformed through specific details (e.g., hollywood star fragment and shard of hush). Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight. No template plots or derivative echoes.</comment>
