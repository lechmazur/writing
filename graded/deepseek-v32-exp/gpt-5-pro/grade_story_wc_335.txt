<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied traits like walking backwards, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The girl's combative tenderness applies secondary pressure, and the archivist's final endurance of irreversible exile is earned with visible cost. However, some emotional beats lean slightly abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with the archivist's unresolved exile, felt cost in "my own exile was not yet reversible." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery like tea leaves and annotations to a decisive change. Orientation is anchored early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The forgotten library constrains choices, unlocking aisles based on hush, and charges the final image with dust turning to glittering script. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, such as the jar's warmth and dust rising, filtered through the archivist's POV to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency through the tea leaf method and annotations, narrowing options to free the shadow with cost legible in the archivist's enduring exile. The dominant stake of reversible exile tightens meaningfully, though the resolution relies slightly on pattern over causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the hinge glyph and combative tenderness, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to exile and resilience without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the girl not crying, and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evidenced in poetic syntax like "shelved slivers of sight like spiteful petals." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping. Purposeful elision, such as the hush triggering library changes, is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, as in "dust turned to glittering script." Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes unique elements like shard-mirror archiving and tea leaf geometry into a non-obvious, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
