<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to name fears is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "ribs vibrate when grief leans in." Micro-choices, such as unspooling tapes and naming monsters, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation in naming "Enough" is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the reaper names their own fear and folds the atlas. Cost is legible in "the broken heart was not mine alone" and the observatory keeping the lexicon burning. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of naming fears escalates meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "dome held the cold of stone" and "atlas page with sea monsters." The observatory and atlas constrain choices and charge the final image by shaping the naming process. Micro-setting elements (tapes, prism) are integrated into action and reflect the reaper's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of naming fears to prevent fog escalates through accumulative density as each recording crystallizes a new fear. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, with cost legible in the reaper's emotional burden and the echo of sacrifice. The final naming of "Enough" forecloses a path with felt cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as naming beasts and the echo of sacrifice, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the folded atlas and lexicon burning, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like "frayed by static until it curled into question."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in poetic phrasing like "voices without names, each pause a vacancy." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "crystallize through scattered light") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, such as "words rose like mica dust," is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the accumulative pattern, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of a reaper naming fears via recordings and atlas feels inevitable, with specific details like "sea monsters nosing the coast of Nowhere." Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and theme.</comment>
