<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to prove whispers over shouts is consistent and drives key choices; internal conflict between loud and quiet methods is embodied in micro-choices like using the vial cork. Emotional depth is concrete, e.g., "I let my voice break softly," and the final renunciation of loudness is earned by prior causality. Relationships with Mara and Alder serve as crucibles, with Alder's mirrored action at closure showing reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Mara returns and Alder softens, legible cost in exhaustion and relief. Orientation is anchored early within 120 words. Causality is tight, with whispers and scent method leading directly to outcome; no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, e.g., cobalt lens and vial cork constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, like "salt on my lips" and "garden's cool, tender bark." Spatial choreography is clear from lighthouse interior to Mara's arrival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's return and proving whispers) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency, e.g., whispering into the lens and using the cork. Cost is legible in Mara's exhaustion and emotional relief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the beckoning method forces a trade-off with Alder's approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet intention over loud force emerges organically from events and images, e.g., the vial cork and lighthouse beam purifying intentions. Subtext operates in gestures like Alder mirroring without knowing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "whispers are not just quiet sounds; they are vibrations of intent." Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "light stands breathing like a great blue lung." Sentences advance story and atmosphere without padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse keeper trope with focus on whispers and intentions feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific, e.g., the garden scent backstory.</comment>
