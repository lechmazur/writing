<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to defy the director is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in career risk. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as empirical observation versus emotional connection to memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as the investigator commits to filing the full report, under a causal-hybrid lens that holds. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from discoveries to action. Cost is legible in "promising the dead that I will file the report without the erasures."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the jammed gate and control module altering tactics. Sensory details like "smell like iron, mud" and the lantern's light charge the final image. The tunnel functions as a micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's movements and decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from empirical observations to the decisive act of calling the journalist. Dominant stake of truth versus cover-up tightens with each discovery, and cost is unmistakable in the risk to her career. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the lantern symbolizing escape and the report moving "toward daylight." Subtext operates in implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is maintained through the interplay of personal and historical legacies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic control and selective attention. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., memories) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "armor that can still hear the small sounds of mercy." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of the death investigator role with Underground Railroad legacy, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and themes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
