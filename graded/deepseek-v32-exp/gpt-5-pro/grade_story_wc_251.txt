<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the coach's trait of hearing unspoken words, intensifying to compel the rebellion plan. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, e.g., "cradle pawns and kings the way you cradle hopes." Micro-choices under pressure, such as involving kids as partners, reveal values. The final endurance to "cradle the town" is earned with visible cost in the pause and second thoughts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the council member's hesitation and "clean new silence." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and mood. Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. Causality is tight from plan to execution, with the window displays forcing attention without forced resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "compasses stagger, iron filings flirt" charging the atmosphere. The magnetic grotto and library constrain choices and inspire the rebellion, directly shaping the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through the POV's perceptual bias. The environment pressures tactics and reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the town from development) is signaled early and escalates through the coach's agency in organizing window displays. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with the synchronized displays, forcing a pause with legible cost in second thoughts. The resolution is earned through protagonist-driven tactics, narrowing options without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the townspeople's internal shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of humble rebellion and second thoughts emerges organically through events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gestures, silence, and the zugzwang metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "cradle the town until it chooses itself," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "I hear the twitch and rattle of thoughts." Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic variation that heightens pressure. Elision is taught and paid off in the closure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and voice-motivated, e.g., "like breath held too long," without muddling clarity. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of chess zugzwang as a metaphor for rebellion, transforming tropes through specific details like the magnetic grotto. Risk-taking in the quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth and authentic vision. Bold choices cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
