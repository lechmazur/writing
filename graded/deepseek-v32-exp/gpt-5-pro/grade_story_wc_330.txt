<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's quiet persistence is embodied through concrete actions like listening to rails and searching; final choice to sing the carousel awake is earned by prior causality, with cost in his enduring patience. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the carousel awakens, with cost legible in "the horses felt the idea of movement." Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (wrong turn to oasis leads to fragment find) and charges the final image; sensory details like "wind bells answered with a silver hesitation" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from searching to finding fragment to awakening carousel; cost is visible in his persistence and the transformation, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as possibility emerges from particulars like the carpenter's actions and the carousel's renewal; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic, rhythmic control; POV is stable and voice modulates with emotional intensity, e.g., "mist had collected there... rusted bolts look like reliquaries." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language like "moths rose like worn confetti" is purposeful and coherent; sentence rhythm supports accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of restoration and silence tropes through specific details; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
