<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "ache in my knees"). Final choice to accept the mundane miracle is earned with visible cost, though internal conflict is subtle and quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens; the realization that trees witness our maps reconfigures meaning with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with sensory details that pressure choices (e.g., maze heals at night); the tower and trees constrain actions and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early and escalate through protagonist's agency with the sextant and dream mapping; cost is legible in the acceptance of healing, though escalation is subtle under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about witnessing and healing without moralizing, supported by subtext in the final realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is strong (e.g., "quantified sorrow"), and rhythmic control under pressure enhances narrative without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language is purposeful (e.g., "stormlit tower"), maintaining clarity even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept of quantified sorrow and labyrinth maintenance is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
