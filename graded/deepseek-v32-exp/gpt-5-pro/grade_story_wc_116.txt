<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final transformation from writing to tending is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in lines like "I felt my task deepen from writing to tending." Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on the page, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the pattern of shards (child, refugees, crack) coheres into a meaningful deepening, with cost legible in the narrator's adaptation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the origami swan opening doors or roots burrowing through books, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with events like the city cracking and refugees arriving deepening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the wear on the swan and the narrator's adaptation, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "crumbling peace" without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, such as the river mirroring and forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that filters the world through the keeper's perspective. Rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off, as with the origami swan's folds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats, without obscuring clarity. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements into a fresh, non-obvious whole, with risk-taking in the lyrical style heightening stakes without gimmickry. The origami swan and regenerative silence are transformed through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
