<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to discover beauty in the incomplete is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving micro-choices like using the feather to mend the kite. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions acting in scene, such as attentiveness to ripples and wind. The final choice to help the boy harmonize discord is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the transformed perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting imperfection as beauty with felt cost in the shared moment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of imagery and theme escalating through the kite incident. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
