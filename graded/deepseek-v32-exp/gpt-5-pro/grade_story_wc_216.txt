<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and drives choices, with embodied interiority like "my ribs answered with a hopeful ache." Micro-choices under pressure, such as embedding messages and opening the silo, reveal values. Relationship with Mara is functional but underdeveloped; however, the final renunciation of borrowed heartbeats is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where time is redefined as weave and grain. Cost is legible when returning "borrowed heartbeats," and orientation is clear early. The emerald silo and capsule sequence coheres, with causality maintained through protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the emerald silo and rye fields constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "glassy tower humming like bees" and "smell of old lilacs" are purposeful. The urn fragment as micro-setting alters tactics and resonates at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes in understanding time escalate under accumulative lens through density increases like the silo entry and capsule opening. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost visible in returning heartbeats. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time as texture emerges through particulars like the ribbon and capsule, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (e.g., urn fragment as "moonchip"). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the realization that time is "weave and grain," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic diction and rhythm that heightens pressure (e.g., "time revealed itself as weave and grain"). No head-hopping; elision in messaging method is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded details like garage sale messages and texture-based time. Synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure that heightens stakes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, supported by vivid particulars.</comment>
