<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to become a historian of small gestures is rooted in concrete backstory (crisis actor vs. real survivor) and embodied emotion (scars, walking). Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as unbinding from scripts while recalling past drills, and the final choice to harvest small gestures is earned with visible cost in the unbinding of the red cord and coiling it like a "sleeping vein."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with the Custodian's nod granting both sentence and pardon, reconfiguring the narrator's role with cost legible in the unbinding. The lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early with the whispering gallery and interregnum setting. The walking method escalates pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery constrains choice and charges the final image through the walking pattern that spells words, with sensory details like "iodine and smoke" and tactile marble. Micro-settings like the chessboard and tiles function as objects that alter tactics, integrating setting into action and theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative/textural lens, from wanting to hear power to actively walking to harvest small gestures, with cost unmistakable in the unbinding from "scripts that made you comfortable in false danger." The dominant stake of preventing the city from forgetting itself tightens through the ritual, foreclosing old paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the chessboard and walking patterns, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and care through the final image of "choreography of care." Subtext operates in gestures like the Custodian's calluses spelling "HOME," avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("luminous absence," "grammar of moving"), and voice remains coherent under pressure with rhythmic control. Purposeful compression, like "Walk BEGIN," is taught and paid off, and dialogue with the Custodian carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "coiling it like a sleeping vein" is coherent and purposeful. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, and read-aloud flow is smooth, with no artifacts obscuring closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar concepts (crisis actor, whispering gallery) with a fresh, non-obvious angle through specific details like the pawn-less chessboard and walking method, transforming tropes via grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
