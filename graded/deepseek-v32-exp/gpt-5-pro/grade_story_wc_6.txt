<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the image of the coin left to sing and the protagonist feeling forgiven without forgetting. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with small actions building coherence. Orientation is clear early, and the structure supports the thematic arc without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices, with the obsidian lagoon and charred trees constraining actions and charging the final image.

Environmental elements mirror internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving scars can sing escalates through protagonist agency in grafting and interactions, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the physical and emotional effort, with one meaningful tightening as the boy's involvement deepens the conflict. Resolution is earned without coincidence, foreclosing paths with visible price.</comment>
