<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and earned change; the final revelation about the father adds depth and cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with felt cost (personal memory release and city awakening); causal lens holds strong with tight linkage from breadcrumbs to box opening; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the fountains and box constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details (e.g., mica-dusted lantern, shadows like tar) are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency under causal lens, from following clues to sharing a secret; cost is legible in the memory confrontation and city's transformation, driving the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events (skepticism, patience, memory) without moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through the box's opening and personal insight, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic, skeptical voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., whispered defiance) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or scaffold; figurative language (e.g., "shadows like cooled tar") is coherent and advances momentum, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized with specificity (e.g., stained glass box, sidereal patience); risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
