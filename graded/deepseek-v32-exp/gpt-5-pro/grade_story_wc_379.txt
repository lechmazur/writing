<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The curator's "leads through following" trait is demonstrated in actions like calling for storytelling, and the final choice to use the locket feels earned. Minor weakness: secondary characters like Mrs. Lin and Javi are functional but lack deep interiority, though sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causal plot linkages lead cohesively to closure—the mailbox opening and letters reading—with felt cost in the community's emotional shift. The hybrid drive lens (dominantly causal) holds, and the persistent constraint of listening shapes tactics. No causality breaks or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored early with sensory details like "dust swirled like hush" and the courtyard, which constrains choices by hosting the gathering. The mailbox and locket function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects POV bias, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing through listening vs. outside intrusion—escalates through protagonist agency: curator initiates storytelling, handles locket discovery, and confronts inspector. Cost is legible in the emotional release after reading letters. Slight convenience in drone/intrusion complications, but they tighten pressure without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges through particulars like the locket clue and letters, with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "proving that listening heals" is slightly explicit. Wisdom earned through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "the mouth fills with our own weather." Dialogue, when present, feels natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., Maria's backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "wind inside a thimble" is purposeful and coherent. Minor florid moments exist but are voice-motivated and don't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of community healing and mystery tropes through specific details like origami cranes and shared rent funds. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes. Not fully groundbreaking but executed with authenticity.</comment>
