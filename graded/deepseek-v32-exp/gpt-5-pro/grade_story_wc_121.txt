<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as facing alternate selves, and the final renunciation (falling to accept gravity) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The choice forecloses a path with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration (Lio accepts gravity, stitching arches into a road) with felt cost in the shift from floating to walking. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, and the persistent constraint of gravity shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the viaduct and rain filtering through Lio's POV to constrain choices (e.g., stepping sideways, puddles as doors). The environment charges the final image of the viaduct dimming, and sensory details are selective and integrated into action, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lio's agency under the accumulative lens, with choices like retracing steps and falling tightening options and deepening stakes. Cost is legible in the transformation and foreclosed paths, and the dominant stake (conquering self-labyrinth) is signaled early and resolved with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as fractured timelines and gravity, offering a resonant answer to self-integration without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "darkening brightness"), and the ending reweights prior material with purposeful ambiguity, avoiding thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific (e.g., noticing "halo" lamps), and any elision (e.g., procedural generation) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peaks, and sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes gravity defier and fractured timelines in a non-obvious way, transformed through specific choices and emotional truth. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold execution.</comment>
