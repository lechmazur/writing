<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., "shaky whenever a client edits silence"). The final choice to confess to the Ear is earned by prior causality, and the trait of wilting near dishonesty constrains actions with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change: the lost conversations are recovered through honesty, reconfiguring their meaning. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from fragment to Ear. Cost is legible in the confession scene, and orientation is clear early, with no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "glass lungs" and "toxic sky" that constrain choices and charge the final image. The Ear as a micro-setting alters tactics, and environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding lost conversations) escalates under causal lens through protagonist's agency, from finding the fragment to confessing at the Ear. Cost is legible in the physical and emotional toll of dishonesty, and the tightening forecloses options with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of honesty and loss emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like confession "desalinating a mood." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the realization that words were "deferred."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature ("leafed words last longer than breath"). POV is stable and single, with diction and syntax reflecting the calligrapher's worldview. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing clarity without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing unique elements like the calligrapher's trait and greenhouse city. Tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
