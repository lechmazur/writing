<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., donor heart twitching like a startled bird). Motivation to understand story magnetism is clear and intensifies through interaction with the dye master, earning the final stance change. No major flaws; closure cost is legible in the harbor image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the shift from patient to harbor. Orientation is clear early (floating rock tea house, donor heart). Structure is a single scene with coherent progression; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful (valley-mist, tea house, morpho wing), with sensory details integrated into action. The wing and sun trails constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning to magnetize stories) is signaled early and escalates through the dye master's teachings and protagonist's agency. Meaningful tightening occurs via the wing and mirror illumination, with cost legible in the acceptance of the donor heart's echoes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events (e.g., morpho wing as lens, iridescent caution), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, supported by subtext in dialogue and actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent (e.g., "custody of breath"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "color lives in structure"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, blending donor heart with mystical tea house. Tropes are transformed through grounded details (e.g., blue morpho wing as lens). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
