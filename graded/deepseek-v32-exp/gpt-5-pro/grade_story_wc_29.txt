<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to use subsonic interference is earned by prior causality, and the trait "cautiously hopeful" constrains actions, though secondary characters are underdeveloped but acceptable for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: tricksters defeated, community healing begins, and provost persuaded. Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in "healing is slower than harm and tastes stranger."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the radio station and astronomical charts constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "antenna tower hums like a spine" are filtered through POV, and environment guides tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: tricksters' probes lead to planned interference, pushback, and resolution. Cost is unmistakable in the effort and ongoing healing. Dominant stake of preventing division tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unity through communication emerges from events and images, not statement, with subtext in "listening builds leverage." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "learned to breathe together," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct with "ethereal grit" tone, stable single POV, and perceptual signature. Poetic yet technical diction remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful with payoff at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "tricksters wearing vacuum for boots," and rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic tricksters and radio communication feels inevitable, with risk-taking in style heightening stakes. Specific details like subsonic frequencies and astronomical charts transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
