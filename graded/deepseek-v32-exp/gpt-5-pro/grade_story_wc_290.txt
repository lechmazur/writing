<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and prudent adventure are consistently embodied, driving micro-choices like measured breathing and organ playing. The final retrieval of the nail-key is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the air tightening. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the city's stillness and the protagonist's promise carry felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and causality links the organ playing to spatial transfixion. The nail's retrieval decisively reweights options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: the church vault pressures the claustrophobic explorer, and the organ loft becomes a tactical space. Sensory details like "candle ash and wet stone" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image. The shadowed nexus and starlight recur to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes around uncovering the key escalate through protagonist agency—playing the organ keys transfixes the mutiny, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the air tightening and the seam closing. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of patience and forgiveness emerges through particulars like the compass and organ music, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the promise to return with music, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in imagery and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, reflective diction and rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, as with the organ's reverberation. Voice remains coherent through peaks, enhancing the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "shadows pooled like spilt ink" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spatial mutiny, geometry, and music feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept transforms exploration tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
