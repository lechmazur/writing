<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tamsin's characterization is deeply integrated with her actions; her motive to listen for unheard stories drives every choice, and her disguise of wisdom as foolishness is embodied in micro-choices like her crooked jokes to Rauk. The final renunciation—allowing the coup to proceed but fraying its certainty—is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the "clocks would slip" line. Interiority remains concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the coup's certainty frays, and Tamsin's cloth becomes a chart for safe doorways. The causal lens holds tightly from her stitching to the disruption of synchronization. Orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the eternal candle shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the eternal candle and orrery are tactile tools that Tamsin uses to alter outcomes. Sensory details like the "cobalt hush" and "wax from the flame" are filtered through her POV, creating a lived-in environment that pressures her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Tamsin's agency under the causal lens, from testing adjacent possibilities to actively disrupting the bell synchronization. The cost is legible on-page in the "wrong bells" and "footsteps tangled," forcing a trade-off that forecloses the coup's smooth execution. Stakes tighten meaningfully from discovery to intervention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: wisdom disguised as foolishness, silence as resistance, and the power of subtlety. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the image of "futures stitched," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Tamsin's breath bending the flame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Tamsin, with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, selective noticing. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., the rhythmic shift in "she walked with a bucket and a joke." Elision (e.g., the conspiracy's details) is taught early and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits zero loops or scaffold; high information density with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "she stitched a waning moon beside his name"). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of galaxy-chart embroiderer and conspiracy unraveling feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the quiet, subtle climax. Specific details like the "eternal candle" and "adjacent possibilities" are irreplaceable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
