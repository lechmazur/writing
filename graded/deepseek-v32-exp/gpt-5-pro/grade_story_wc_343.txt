<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's curiosity and isolation are embodied through concrete interactions with rivets, birds, and the hopscotch board; micro-choices under pressure, such as solving the puzzle and folding the luminance, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; final renunciation of isolation for shared mapping is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear within 120 words; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the captured luminance transforms isolation into communal sharing, with cost legible in the "festival of names" and the folded dog-ear serving as a vessel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV; the hopscotch board functions as micro-setting that constrains the key choice of heading, and the airship's groaning beams and starling murmurations charge the final image of folded light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stranded luminance escalates through protagonist's agency in solving the hopscotch puzzle and directing the ascent; cost is legible in the transformation from isolation to connection, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus connection emerges organically through images like the dog-ear as harbor and the folded luminance; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmically controlled, modulating under pressure without head-hopping; elision in pattern-solving is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with clear propulsion in peak beats like the capture of luminance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of antique airship, map apprentice, and stranded luminance feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
