<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is vividly embodied and drives the narrative; the final choice to release the letter is earned through prior causality with visible cost, as seen in "my hands trembled" and the resolution of "bravely conflicted" feeding like wolves. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and motivation is clear and consistent, intensifying to compel high-stakes action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent causal chain from inciting incident to closure with a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end; cost is legible in the "shared flinch" and "silence would speak without permission," and the inferred Causal lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the structure tightens meaningfully around the letter's release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the "frost cabinets" and "snow pressed against the glass ribs" constraining the archivist's actions; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image of "lights blink along the stacks." The library under snow functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of truth versus silence escalate through protagonist agency, with one meaningful tightening in the decision to send the letter; cost is unmistakable in the "shifting timbre of rustling pages" and potential scandal. Under the Causal lens, pressure coheres and narrows options, driven by the archivist's active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence and rebellion emerges through concrete events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like "silence answered"; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "thaw the grammar that kept our tongues obedient." Complexity is embraced without moralizing, and motifs like the letter reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature evident in phrases like "catalogs ticked with slow light"; rhythmic control under pressure maintains clarity, and any elision (e.g., "ghost channels") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "a coil of contraband truths" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum, and closure beats remain clear, with no artifacts obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cryogenic archivism and political rebellion feels inevitable, with specific details like "encryption that smelled of dust and ozone" avoiding cliché; risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
