<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and credible endurance. The final choice to cultivate lightness in grief is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the closure image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost in the final preference for silence. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting and objects (wind turbines, whittled birds) constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. The farmhouse and turbines pressure tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict between prescribed cheer and authentic grief) escalates with the inspector's visit, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the endurance and reconfiguration of hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of lightness in grief emerges through particulars and images, with subtext in actions like whittling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, supporting propulsion without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of dystopian and emotional elements, with risk-taking in quiet narrative. Specific details and transformation of tropes feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
