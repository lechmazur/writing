<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., counting heartbeats to manage fear). Motivation to fetch wisdom from failure drives credible endurance, and the final choice to share the map is earned with visible cost. The digital ghost serves as a secondary pressure, though its ethereal nature limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (protagonist's plan to seek a wiser ending), under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (ghost, shard) shape tactics. The ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., observatory's cold, shattered mug altering the scene). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image with the shard's refraction. Environment actively pressures the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from failure) escalates under the hybrid lens through protagonist's agency (e.g., interacting with ghost, discovering the corridor). Cost is legible in the decision to share the map, foreclosing isolation with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events (e.g., ink patterns, heartbeat counting) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption, reweighting failure through the corridor metaphor. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue with the ghost feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Elision (e.g., radio static) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no figurative muddle. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors is balanced by purposeful pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes death certificate error and digital ghost with specificity, transforming tropes through grounded details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
