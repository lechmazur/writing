<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied emotion. The final choice to not steal the portrait is earned by the encounter with the man, revealing a credible endurance with visible cost. However, some abstract phrasing in peak beats slightly reduces concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the trade-off. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The structure coheres through imagery and choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald station constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. Micro-settings like the jar and destiny's door shape tactics. Specificity is purposeful and vivid, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pressing ear against destiny's door) escalates through the man's hesitation, driven by protagonist agency. The final choice to not act narrows options with visible cost. Pressure tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of choice and reflection emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the traded moment. Subtext in flower codes and the jar's use enriches complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., flower codes) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving the story. Minor overwriting in dense beats, but no loops or artifacts that harm clarity. Closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes surreal and emotional elements with originality. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the jar and flower codes. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
