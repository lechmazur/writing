<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like "cheerful gloom." Micro-choices under pressure, such as using the crater glass and seeds, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final conjecture and compromise are earned by prior causality with visible cost, foreclosing paths meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost in the "new compromise blossomed" image. Orientation is clear early; causality remains intact with no breaks. The persistent constraint of the cave's forgetting shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the iridescent cave constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and reflect POV bias, such as "light stepping on crystal ribs." The environment actively guides the protagonist's actions and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, using tools to map absences. Cost is legible in the compromise that "half visible, half song" reweights options. Agency drives a meaningful tightening without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and absence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the bird's eye "held continents." Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the conjecture about protection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression, like "the cave forgets in motion," is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "the cave shed a sharp laugh." Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm clarity or closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements like the sea-foam recollectionist and crater glass into an inevitable whole. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details transform tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
