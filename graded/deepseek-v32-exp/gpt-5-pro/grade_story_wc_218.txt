<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., "calm hardened into my backbone") and micro-choices that reveal values. The final pact proposal is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in limited time and effort, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost (limited time, proposed pact), under an accumulative lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the discovery of the chamber reweights options without causality breaks, meeting the 9+ test with persistent constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (sap, tide, iron) that constrain choices (e.g., paths kinked, pillars shifting) and charge the final image. The temple orchard acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fostering interspecies respect) escalates through protagonist agency (redrawing paths, using copper wire), narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in time constraint and effort, meeting the 9+ test with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (listening, remodeling), with subtext in pillars' responses. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material via the pact proposal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "orchard breathing like a sleeping choir"). Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is concise and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. No artifacts like loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports closure, meeting the 9+ test with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of living stone pillars and interspecies communication feels inevitable, with specific details that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in poetic style pays off without obscuring clarity, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
