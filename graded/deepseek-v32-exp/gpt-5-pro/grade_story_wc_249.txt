<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in love for Jonah, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The "quietly rebellious" trait drives key actions like drumming and accepting the cost of blurred outlines. Interiority is concrete, avoiding stock phrasing, and the final choice to carry "auroral sorrow" is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds, with closure as Charged Poise—accepting the blurring of self for shared dream. Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in "If the cost was that my outline blurred, I would accept the blur." Causality is tight from drumming to deepened coherence, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is vividly specific, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "air tasted metallic and sweet" are selective and POV-filtered. The auric lagoon under starlight evolves from setting to active participant, shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving Jonah escalates through protagonist's agency in drumming and consenting to deeper coherence. Under accumulative lens, density increases with rhythmic patterns, leading to visible cost: risk of blurred outlines. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love, memory, and sacrifice emerges through images like drumming and the auric lagoon, not direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "auroral sorrow" as a lantern, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and rhythms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose reflects the protagonist's mind. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "I became the dock and the boat and the tide." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "petals that shivered like thoughts" is purposeful and coherent. No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentences advance story with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of entangled memories and sound wave garden feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure that heightens stakes. Specific details like drumming and auric lagoon transform tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, supporting closure.</comment>
