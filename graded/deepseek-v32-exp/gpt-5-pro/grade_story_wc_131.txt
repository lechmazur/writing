<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to become visible is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the intimate moment with Mara.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, as the protagonist steps out to be visible, reconfiguring their role with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
