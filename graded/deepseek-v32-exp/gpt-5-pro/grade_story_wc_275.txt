<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's pacifism and perceptiveness are concretely embodied through micro-choices like pouring dust and sheathing the knife, with internal conflict dramatized in her resistance to her father's call. The father's transformation is earned by the storm collaboration and her steadfastness, foreclosing vengeance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her senseless perceptivity warring with his unsettled map, culminating in an earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure achieved through the father's decisive change—looping the knife sheath over a peg—legible cost in "his old map burning quietly." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the sandbag's persistent constraint shapes tactics. The engraved quiet's melody at the storm's end reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices: the glass dome threatens collapse during the storm, and the sandbag scrap evolves from practical use to symbolic closure in planting cuttings. Sensory details like "heat like breath held inside glass" are selective and POV-filtered. The dome and sandbag charge the final image, constraining action and enriching resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of continuity versus vengeance escalates under accumulative lens through the father's return and the storm, tightening via protagonist agency—she pours dust and threads sandbag strips. Cost is legible in the father's shoulder-loosening and the strangers gathering petals. Escalation is driven by her choices, though the storm introduces external pressure that complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pacifist continuity emerges through particulars like inculcating plants and sheathing knives, with subtext in gestures such as the dust line between them. The ending's "water the dust into possibility" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images like the sandbag shift meaning to charge closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—e.g., "engraved quiet" reflects her senseless perceptivity. Poetic syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, as in the storm's "dome sings." No head-hopping; elision like the father's backstory is taught and paid off in his transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with lines like "the engraved quiet folds around him like a shawl" advancing multiple roles. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence variety supports accumulative momentum. Closure image is sharpened by precise diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic peacemaking, transforming tropes through specific details like inculcating plants and the sandbag's evolving use. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with risk-taking in quiet resolution. The father's sheathing thunder feels inevitable due to prior causality.</comment>
