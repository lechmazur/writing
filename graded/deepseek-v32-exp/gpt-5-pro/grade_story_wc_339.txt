<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to understand "the physics of letting go" is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like handling the snow globe and recorder. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though some abstract phrasing slightly diminishes peak beats. Final renunciation in releasing the snow globe is earned by prior causality with visible cost, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) in the snow globe's release, costing the protagonist's former stance. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the final image ("the math forgive me finally") legibly shows cost. Persistent constraint of the snow globe shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken ship library is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (e.g., "books lay spined like fish"), and the snow globe as a micro-setting constrains choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect POV bias, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal conflict over letting go escalates under accumulative lens through discoveries (tape, snow globe), driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible in the final release, narrowing options and reweighting stakes. One meaningful tightening suffices, though secondary stake with Malik is minor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically through images and events (e.g., tape message, ticket stub), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the snow globe's ascent, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in objects deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful elision (e.g., "grief made its proofs in salt and pressure") taught and paid off. No head-hopping; dialogue is natural but minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and serves atmosphere (e.g., "trapped bubble trembled like a held breath"). Rhythm supports propulsion, and closure image is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library, last transmission, and snow globe feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Transformation of tropes through specific detail (e.g., ticket stub) and non-obvious moral calculus. Closure reconfigures meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
