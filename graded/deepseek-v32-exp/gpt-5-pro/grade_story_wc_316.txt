<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kana's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and drives key choices, with embodied interiority like fearing the "snowblind calm." The final vivification action is earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible when numbness cracks. Relationships with clones and sensei apply pressure, though some emotional moments edge toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the clones become guardians and Kana's numbness cracks, with cost felt in "feeling returned like a tidal alphabet." The Hybrid drive lens holds, and orientation is clear early. Causality is tight, with Kana's actions leading to the verdict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating dojo and brain in a jar are integral, constraining choices (e.g., the hearing's sky-edge location) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the jar's chimes and dojo's atmosphere mirroring internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kana's agency under the Hybrid lens, from fear to vivifying the brain, with cost legible in the cracking numbness. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through complementary opposites, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—identity, ownership, numbness—with subtext in images like the brain's fog-ribbon words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("guardians of each other") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "history rewrites itself." Dialogue is minimal but natural, and perceptual signature is strong. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but clear, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "tidal alphabet," enhancing propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing clone custody, ego death, and floating dojo with specificity. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids templates.</comment>
