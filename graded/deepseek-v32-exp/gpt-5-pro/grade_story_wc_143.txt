<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as setting the vial and taking the photograph. The "purposefully curious" trait drives actions, but lacks strong contradictory impulses, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost in the loss of "unpurchased sky" and the melancholy. Orientation is clear early, and the vial's trigger leads decisively to the photograph, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the summit and vial constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like the crater lake and orbital mirrors are integrated into action and reflect internal state, though some descriptions are slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start; escalation under accumulative lens through density increase as dawn approaches. Protagonist's agency in taking the photograph forecloses options with visible cost in "no second last" and melancholy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. change emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in the chemical message and final photograph. Ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with poetic voice and perceptual signature in lines like "crater lake shines like a pupil." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision are paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentences and no scaffolds or loops. Figurative language advances sense, especially in climax with "film drinks what remains of unpurchased sky," maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, combining scientific detail with lyric reflection; tropes are transformed through specificity. Risk-taking in quiet ending heightens stakes, and synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
