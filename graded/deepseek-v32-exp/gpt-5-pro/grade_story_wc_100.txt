<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is deeply rooted in consistent traits of weariness and stubborn grief, compelling his journey; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure earning the final act of occupying impossible spaces, foreclosing paths with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the lens mending reconfigures rest and signals with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, driven by imagery and causality from the package arrival to the library descent, with orientation clear early and no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the shop's stillness to the underwater library, constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the lens and library acting as micro-settings that pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of giving rest a permanent address escalates through the undertaker's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when he occupies the seam, foreclosing options and paying a cost in embodied effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of rest and signals emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the mended lens; subtext in gestures like inventorying avoids moralizing, reweighting prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; experimental lyric prose is taught and legible, and elision (e.g., note) pays off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peaks, though slight density in imagery doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes undertaker and lighthouse lens into a fresh, inevitable arc, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes; emotional specificity and transformation of tropes through lived detail avoid derivation.</comment>
