<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotions like shaking hands and the scar map. Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses of apology and exorcism, earning the final change. Mara's consistent dedication and the narrator's flawed past create credible dynamics. However, minor abstraction in emotional summary slightly limits peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change: the recording of the hymn and the promise to witness, with cost in the bottle's crack and orchard's loss. Causal lens holds strong from past actions to present redemption. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and perfume bottle constrain choices and charge the closure, with sensory details like "paper whispering like leaves" and the bottle's crack. Setting pressures tactics through the exorcism and mirrors internal states. Specificity is purposeful, elevating atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from apology to exorcism, driven by narrator's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the bottle's hairline crack and the orchard's destruction, foreclosing options. Pressure tightens meaningfully through the induced currents, with a visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles and redemption emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like Mara's hand on the narrator's. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the recorded hymn and promised change. Complexity avoids tidy morals, lingering in ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, using patterned elision like "paper rind protecting paper flesh" that pays off at closure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, though minor overwriting in metaphors like "bees drunk on toner" occurs without harming clarity. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion is clear. Figurative language is purposeful and supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gossip-column exorcist and sheet music archive is fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyrical structure. Emotional truth avoids templates, and specific details like the Leyden jar transform familiar tropes. Bold choices heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
