<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in trauma, with embodied interiority ("I taste iron in my mouth") and micro-choices under pressure (placing the geode) revealing values. The final renunciation of extraction is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "leaving a wound unharvested." Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the decision to leave the pool intact reweights stakes with cost ("a grave we refused to mine"). Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in the final image's reconfiguration of trauma and potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric, with the floating observatory and salt flats filtering POV perception. The geode crystal constrains choices (stabilizing readout) and charges the final image ("a small planet of quartz keeping my tide in check"), essential to closure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping vs. extracting potential) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist agency in the hunt and final decision. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional and thematic trade-off ("unwilling to be a weapon"). One meaningful tightening forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and events, not statement, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to trauma and potential ("leaving a wound unharvested is a choice"). Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical rhythm control under pressure. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful elision (e.g., "the afterward") taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("waivering yet undeniable"). Rhythm varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sci-fi and trauma in a fresh, non-obvious way, with specific details (geode, perturbation theory) feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material authentically.</comment>
