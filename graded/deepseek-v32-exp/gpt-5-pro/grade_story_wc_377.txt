<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and consistent, with her seasonal muteness and motivation to preserve wonder driving key choices. Her actions under pressure, such as tuning the bells and handling the iceberg fragment, reveal embodied emotion and micro-choices that align with her traits. The final endurance of her muteness during the climax is earned by prior causality, though internal conflict is minimal, slightly limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through sensory density and pattern shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with the bells' symphonies affecting the crowd. Closure lands with cost legible in the iceberg's melting and Mara's muted voice, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, though the escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering bluff setting is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory details that constrain choices, such as the wind tunnel and cloud whispers. The environment charges the final image as the sculpture becomes a listening instrument, and micro-setting elements like the iceberg fragment directly shape tactics. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates under the Accumulative lens through Mara's agency in tuning the sculpture, leading to a meaningful deepening as truth unfolds in the crowd. Cost is unmistakable in the iceberg's loss and emotional releases, narrowing options and reweighting stakes. Pressure coheres without reliance on antagonist, driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of communication beyond words emerges organically through events and images, such as the bells' symphonies revealing truth without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the aurora's thickening. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV from Mara is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. Purposeful elision, like the post-words premise, is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and character-specific under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is integrated and clear, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with propulsion, and there are no coherence issues or register drifts. Line-level craft supports closure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes fresh, non-obvious elements—post-words world, kinetic sculpture, iceberg fragment—into an organic whole that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices ensures memorability and authenticity.</comment>
