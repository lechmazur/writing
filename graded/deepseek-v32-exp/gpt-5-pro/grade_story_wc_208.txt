<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., building the shelter). The final reimagining of purpose is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the shift to community focus; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with clear orientation and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail (e.g., "salt-white world hummed") and the archway as micro-setting constrain choices and charge the final image, integrating environment with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens driven by protagonist agency (e.g., using the lantern slide to build shelter), with cost visible in the redefined delivery approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges through images and actions, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in gestures like the slide's projection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with stable POV and rhythmic control; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., storm imagery) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; no loops or scaffold, and prose propels momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (e.g., driftwood sculptor and lantern slide) with risk-taking in lyrical style; transformations feel inevitable and heighten stakes.</comment>
