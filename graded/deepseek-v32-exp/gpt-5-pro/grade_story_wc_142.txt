<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in dual allegiance, with interiority shown through concrete actions like using the chip and painting messages. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final pivot is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the braided allegiance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied in lines like "hopeful desperation had a smell."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal hybrid lens with clear orientation by ~120 words. Closure is a decisive change (the pivot succeeds) with felt cost in the "rough and strong" braid, and the foundation stone chip persistently shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reconfigures options without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the raft city's geography influencing parade routes. The foundation stone chip functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory details like "diesel and jasmine" are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating gentrification) escalates under a hybrid lens via protagonist agency, with one meaningful tightening when the reroute plan is implemented. Cost is legible in the risk to trust from both guild and council. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of community resistance emerges through particulars like the chip and graffiti without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "braid" image, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures, e.g., pressing the chip into palms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies." Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no major artifacts or loops. Figurative language like "hopeful desperation had a smell" is coherent and purposeful. Minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of raft city, encoded graffiti, and dual allegiance, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
