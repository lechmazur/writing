<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characters exhibit clear motives and contradictions, such as Li's hunger versus learning; the philosopher's final choice to teach compassion is earned through prior causality. Micro-choices, like Li slamming his palm in time, reveal value shifts with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where justice as an open net reweights prior material with cost felt in the elders' "subtle ache." Orientation is clear early, and causality flows from discoveries like the whistle calling fireflies to reveal Yazhen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices, such as the wet parapet enabling whistle echoes and fireflies providing light for descent. Sensory details like "sweating stones" and "fireflies as breathing lamps" are selective and purposeful. The bamboo whisk constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival versus compassion escalates under accumulative lens through agency: the philosopher's investigation and Li's learning. Cost is legible in the elders' ache and altered nets. One meaningful tightening occurs with Yazhen's revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns and compassion emerges through particulars like net-mending and Yazhen's rescue; subtext operates in gestures like her "palm in apology." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "justice is a net that also learns to open."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person with poetic, perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "whisper leapt, bounced." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Li's report. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "foam maps," is coherent and purposeful. No register drift or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nets, compassion, and hidden patterns feels inevitable; lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the bamboo whisk and firefly season avoid tropes. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
