<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The operator and apprentice exhibit clear motives rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final shared empathy moment is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the scratches from borrowed traits. However, some emotional states edge toward abstraction in peak beats, slightly reducing concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the transposed empathy and shared relief, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The vanishing stars pattern tightens coherence, and orientation is clear early. A minor hairline slip exists in the slight ambiguity of the "third grammar" pivot, but it doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop and halo fragment constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details (e.g., "ink smelled of citrus solvents") filtered through POV. Specificity is purposeful, and the fragment's evolution from washer to hinge alters tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency through the vanishing stars and empathy experiments, narrowing options with cost legible in the exchanged traits and emotional strain. The stakes in understanding emotion mathematically deepen meaningfully, though the cosmic scale occasionally overshadows immediate tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transposed empathy emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like the halo fragment handling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the theorem and shared moment, reweighting prior material without moralizing, and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Diction and syntax reflect the accumulative style, and deliberate ambiguity is taught and paid off. Minor register consistency in "lucid turbulence" causes slight modulation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language purposeful and taught. No loops or scaffold artifacts, and clarity persists in peak beats. A slight overwriting tendency in metaphorical stacks (e.g., "breath like an equation") nudges down without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of transposed empathy with mathematical emotion feels fresh and inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details like the halo fragment and personality borrowing. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept commits fully to closure.</comment>
