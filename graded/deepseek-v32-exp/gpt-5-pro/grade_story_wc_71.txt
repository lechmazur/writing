<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, and cost is felt in the vow to "return what I can."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in the agreement to "keep each other company." Accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "salt wicks into the air" and objects (orris root, hush) constraining choices and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by narrator's agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the hush "accomplishing the smallest, bravest thing." Stakes tighten through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars like displaced objects and the photograph, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the house agreement, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "listens for shifts that grow so gradual." No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "hush that burns inward," and rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized with non-obvious elements like shard of hush, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
