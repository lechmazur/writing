<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing values. However, internal conflict is subtle and could be more contradictory; the final choice to teach the fisherman is earned but lacks deep struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the threat to the dock and the collaborative effort. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, though the plot is quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects like the rope and fulgurite glass constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details integrated into action. The golden dock under snow pressures decisions, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes around preserving knowledge escalate through the dock removal threat and decoding process, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible, but escalation is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and actions without moralizing, offering a resonant answer on preservation and patience. Subtext in knots and fulgurite enriches complexity, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm, perceptual signature, and clean dialogue. No head-hopping, but occasional lyrical density may slight obscure immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density, varied rhythm, and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story without scaffold, though minor overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing decoding with seed preservation, feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but it echoes familiar themes of knowledge loss.</comment>
