<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal values. The father's partner is legibly characterized through status dynamics. Final endurance is earned with visible cost, though some emotions edge toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with the protagonist gaining proof and understanding, reconfiguring her stance under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image. Persistent constraint of the truce shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, with sensory details like "swells sighed" and "hook squeals" filtered through POV. The pier and market constrain action, and the fob as a micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency through false starts and stillness, tightening pressure under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the partner's wince and the pier's groan, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in silence and gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the record of trust breaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision in dialogue (signs) is taught and paid off, and voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesized organically, with risk-taking in structure and theme that heightens stakes. The sound of trust breaking feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding template plots.</comment>
