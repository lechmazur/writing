<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices; Eli's internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure revealing values. The final choice (Eli pocketing the photograph) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though his shift to laughter feels slightly rapid but credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Eli's laughter and pocketing the photograph) under a causal lens, with cost legible in the shattered panel and man's disappearance. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from tracking to escape, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the atrium and hearing aid constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with stakes tightening from finding Eli to confronting the man; cost is legible in the shattered panel, though the antagonist's threat is slightly underdeveloped for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Eli's laughter and the city listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure; perceptual signature is consistent, and any elision is taught and paid off, such as the hearing aid's role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and no major artifacts; minor figurative density in peaks doesn't obscure clarity, and closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesized uniquely, with tropes transformed through specific details; risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
