<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concretely embodied through her tranquil perception and micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing ownership and arranging hives. Her motivation to preserve unspoken words is consistently dramatized, culminating in an earned renunciation to "carry weight, not translate it" with visible cost. However, the abstract nature of her primary drive slightly limits the visceral impact of her contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Mara's rituals retie the covenant, cost legible in "the air tasted briefly of clover" and the hives' "clicked yes." Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the stained glass box and covenant shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the oasis and stained glass box constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "hives clicked like loose teeth" and "wind combed the black sand" are filtered through Mara's perception, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, from opening the box to tracing clues and performing rituals, tightening the stake of preserving unspoken words. Cost is unmistakable in the ghosts' revealed faces and the winds' agreement, foreclosing options with felt transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the box and gestures, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to listening versus speaking. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, as Mara's promise to "carry weight" crystallizes the covenant's cost and renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "mute eloquence of labor ended." Voice modulates with pressure through rhythmic control and purposeful compression, such as in the closure's "ellipse around the hives," without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere seamlessly. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "bees that were not there began humming" is coherent and enhances clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghosts, beekeeping, and a stained glass covenant feels inevitable and fresh, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, supported by emotional specificity in Mara's reclusive astonishment.</comment>
