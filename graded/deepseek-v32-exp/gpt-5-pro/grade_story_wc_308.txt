<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in trait of reverence; interiority concrete with embodied emotion like clutching the arrowhead; final choice of stillness earned through prior causality of humming and listening, with cost in patience and bow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (pulse as guide, bow of gratitude) and felt cost under accumulative/textural lens; orientation clear early; causality tight from test tap to drone inviting pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting of bone towers and canyon pressures choices through echoes and bird patterns; sensory details selective and purposeful, like "ripples skating across petrified marrow"; environment constrains tactics and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in appraising pulse escalates through agency: test tap, low drone, bird observations narrow options; cost legible in stillness and forgone chase, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of stillness and guidance emerges from particulars like arrowhead and birds; subtext in traders' fear and forgiveness; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice poetic and consistent, e.g., "canyon charting itself in diminishing syllables"; elision taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose dense with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative language purposeful, like "gulls settle in pale commas," without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation through echoes and memory; specific details like stone arrowhead and bone towers transform tropes; risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
