<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotions like "my body rehearsing loss" and micro-choices under pressure, such as opening the vial. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to grieve is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as the protagonist grieves, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the line "I grieve, I said," and the persistent constraint of scent memory shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "crystal shadows" and "frosted green" plants that constrain choice and charge the final image. The greenhouse pressures the protagonist's actions, and details are filtered through POV bias, integrating seamlessly with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional understanding escalates through the violet's transformation and the protagonist's agency in opening the vial.

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures like the vial's interaction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in lines like "crystal shadows gathered." Voice is consistent and poetic, with no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, avoiding loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, as in "smoke touched the crystal perfume vial," and momentum is maintained without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes lanterns, scents, and extinct plants in a fresh, non-obvious way, with emotional specificity.
