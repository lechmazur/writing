<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the narrative. The final shift from seeking the cave to the high pass is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in accepting failure. Contradictory impulses of regret and renewal act simultaneously, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the accumulative/textural lens, with the high pass decision reconfiguring options and cost legible in the curved markers. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, teaching the pattern of weaving between worlds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the canyon and driftwood markers shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias, such as "mist stitched the Thunder-echo range," integrating environment with internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the flute playing and marker arrangement deepening stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the shift from failure to witness, narrowing options through a meaningful tightening that forecloses the cave path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of learning from failure emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the loom imagery. Subtext operates in gestures like the flute suturing histories, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evidenced by rhythmic control in lines like "canyon hush gave the morning a pulse." Purposeful elision in the weaving concept is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "the quiet turns avalanchingly quiet again, but kinder," serving propulsion and clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of failure and weaving between worlds, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming the relic keeper trope through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
