<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's characterization is deeply integrated with the desert's honesty, shown through her actions and backstory scar. The narrator's motivation to consecrate the echo is clear and drives micro-choices. Interiority is concrete, though the narrator's internal conflict is less explored, but sufficient for length. Final choice to preserve echo is earned with visible cost in the hush and echo's effect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Charged Poise with the echo's arrival reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clear early—narrator with Lio at pavilion after prophet's departure. Cost is legible in the echo touching the woman's question and child's laughter, and the hinge learning names. Persistent constraint of the kinetic parapet shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dunes humming and pavilion murmuring. The pavilion and kinetic parapet constrain choices, as Lio walks lines to ensure safety, and the parapet charges the final image of balance. Micro-setting elements (ropes, clearings) are woven into action and perception, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wisdom without ownership escalates under accumulative lens through conjuring clearings and the echo's manifestation. Agency is driven by Lio and the narrator's actions, with cost legible in the effort and the echo's effect. One meaningful deepening tightens options, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening and preservation emerges organically from particulars like Lio's scar and the conjured clearings. Subtext operates in imagery (knots, whispers) and the final non-literal answer of the echo's weather and grain. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete actions and the charged poise at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice—e.g., "dunes hummed like glass ribs." Perceptual signature is selective and biased, reflecting the narrator's focus. Lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "whisperfield calm." No register drift or muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build-up to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of preservation wisdom through specific elements like line walker and kinetic parapet feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Details are particular and transformative, avoiding template plots. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
