<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's reckless idealism and fierce gentleness are consistently embodied in micro-choices like soothing roots with a lullaby, compelling higher-stakes vows. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing. Final renunciation of bargaining alone is earned by prior causality with visible cost in accepting scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly from arrival to regrafting, with closure as a decisive change (brother's path restored) and felt cost in shared breath pledge. Orientation is clear within 120 words; persistent constraint of debt shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "accept the scars" and roots reading failures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (roots snaring ankles) and charges the final image (orchard as loom). Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, like "pears trembled with the weight of forgiving." Micro-setting (tarot card) alters tactics and closure, elevating beyond decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending destinies) escalates through protagonist's agency: soothing roots, bargaining with Keeper, and regrafting. Cost is unmistakable in accepting scars and pledging shared breath. One meaningful tightening forecloses solitary bargaining, driven by causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending through consent and hunger emerges via images (orchard as loom, regrafted path) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in "carried thread" and hands knowing "bravery and care." Subtext operates in Keeper's dialogue and burnt card's evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, e.g., "inlaying meaning everywhere" as irrigation. Poetic diction is voice-motivated; dialogue with Keeper carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "orchard quivered as if a fever broke." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum; no scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bartered destinies and catacomb orchard feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Core premise transforms familiar tropes through specific choices like regrafting and tarot card as receipt. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
