<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority rendered through concrete sensory details and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to favor listening over noise is earned by prior causality and embodies credible curiosity, with visible cost in risking protocol.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as the protagonist's choice to cancel the siren test reconfigures the situation, validated by the storm splitting. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to ending, with orientation clear within the first 120 words and no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate under protagonist agency, with the zero hour pressure forcing a decisive choice that narrows options and carries visible cost. Escalation is driven by causal linkages, and the resolution alters outcomes with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in actions like canceling the siren.

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable, and purposeful elision (e.g., solstice hush) enhances clarity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, and peak beats maintain clarity without overwriting.</comment>
