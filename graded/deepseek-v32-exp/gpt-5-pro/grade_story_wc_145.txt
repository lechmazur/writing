<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the wind does not snarl, which worries me." Final choice to mark coordinates is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the cold and tranquility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing via the discovery of the singular convergence, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost ("the cold edits our bones"). Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern-based escalation leading to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "kettle sighs" and "steam bloom the window" filtering through POV. Environment constrains choice (ice doesn't crack) and charges the final image (condensation pattern guides discovery).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding convergence) escalates under Accumulative lens through density of clues (condensation, falcon, scraping). Agency drives escalation, with cost legible in the "worrying tranquility" and physical endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from images and events, e.g., condensation as map and convergence as hidden eye. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("maps mishear them"). Voice is dry-witted and poetic, with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "condensation draws routes fanning outward," enhancing clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of singular convergence is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
