<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final change—lilac unease settled as weather—is earned through prior causality, with cost legible in the transformation of noise and meaning. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where "meaning showed itself in the balance." Cost is felt in the protagonist's settled unease and the grotto's sigh. Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the grotto's hush forces stance crystallization, and the mandala's destruction by tide edits meaning. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with mist and sand filtering POV. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—escalates through protagonist agency in drawing the mandala and interjecting with strokes. Cost is visible in the "hurt grew edges we could hold without bleeding." Pressure tightens under accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, e.g., the emergent hush as a seam for forgotten returns. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, in "meaning showed itself in the balance." Subtext operates in silence and gesture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "listening backward" and "lilac unease." Voice is poetic yet controlled, with rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "hush thickened, less a blanket than a tide reversing." Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of emergent hush and chalk artist in grotto is fresh and specific, with synthesis feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premises or template plots.</comment>
