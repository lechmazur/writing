<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "pain salts the floor with stars"). Final choice to listen rather than open wounds is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (scar "opens like a book"), and the inferred Hybrid lens holds. Causality is tight, from telepathic discovery to bargain with plants, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (tower roots guide the tunnel descent; hourglass and coffee rings recur with reweighted meaning). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "meteor hush" and "green rain."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from plant communication to the elm cut, with cost legible in pain and the sap "sigh." Dominant stake (closure without cruelty) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at the end ("reading is not tearing"). Subtext in plant dialogues deepens without moralizing, and epiphanies are earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "fern says... its voice is green rain"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., coffee rings reading) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports closure (e.g., "scar warms... opens like a book"). Sentence-level propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes telepathy with plants and displaced miracle with specificity and risk, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Emotional truth and fresh inflection in the final reconfiguration feel inevitable.</comment>
