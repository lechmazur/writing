<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and rooted in embodied grief, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tilting the viewfinder, gathering volunteers). The advisor's quiet charisma is consistently shown through gestures and whispers, creating a crucible relationship. However, some interiority edges toward abstraction in peak beats, slightly reducing specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing—the camera's blank eye reweights memory and absence with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early (harbor, camera, advisor), and the mosaic structure (performance shards) teaches its pattern by ~25% and lands coherently. The final image ("a harbor that will remember for me") makes cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor setting is vivid and sensory, selectively filtered through POV (e.g., "tides hum their patient arithmetic"). The camera as a micro-setting object constrains choices (conducting the performance) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the crowd, with details like "chalk the pier with soft constellations" integrating action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation builds through density increase—the signing performance tightens pressure, slowing boats and softening the police captain. Protagonist agency drives the deepening (e.g., "lifting it like a conductor lifts a baton"), with cost legible in the "joyful sorrow" ripple. One meaningful cadence shift reweights the stake of honoring quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through particulars (camera, signing, harbor sounds) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the camera's "blank squared eye," repricing absence as presence. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the advisor tapping the camera's empty back.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "our fingers fletching arrows of meaning"). Poetic voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., the camera's lack of film) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue and signing carry subtext and goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm (e.g., "their wrists draw harbors; their palms make moons"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("joyful sorrow plays a melody") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sign language, silence mapping, and a filmless camera feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with bold emotional specificity.</comment>
