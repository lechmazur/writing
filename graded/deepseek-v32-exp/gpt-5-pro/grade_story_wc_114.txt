<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's grief and guilt are embodied through specific micro-choices (e.g., holding the illustration, using the scale), with interior contradictions acting in scene. Final decision to warn the convoy is earned by prior causality, foreclosing silence with visible cost ("chest heaves as if a glacier turned inside me"). No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the protagonist's radio warning and the "bruise of color" imagery. Orientation anchored early (mountain weather station, post-fever). Lens holds without ambiguity; persistent constraint (oracle's revelations) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., oracle's muffled drives, scale on bench) and charges the final image (aurora lifting a curtain). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("rimed vanes," "coal dust"), filtered through POV. Recurring objects (illustration) evolve with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens driven by protagonist's agency in uncovering truth (smudging illustration, weighing graphite). Dominant stake (guilt vs. duty) tightens with cost unmistakable in "mass of my silence" and curses from closures. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (truth, margins, reconciliation) emerges through particulars (illustration, oracle's words) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via "occupying margins" and taping back the illustration. Subtext in gestures (smudge) deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV has distinct perceptual signature ("auroral sorrow," "fever burned the usual tunnel") and rhythmic control under pressure. Experimental lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue (oracle's wind) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifice. Figurative language ("glacier turned inside me") is consistent and clear in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs; no register drift or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, technology, and nature feels inevitable (oracle as character, illustration as key object). Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (alpine saxifrage, desiccant scale) avoid templates.</comment>
