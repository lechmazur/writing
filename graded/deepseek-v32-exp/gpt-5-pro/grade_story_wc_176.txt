<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "forgiveness made the chill tolerable." The final choice to stay and listen is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the physical and emotional effort. Micro-choices under pressure, like reconfiguring the rope, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the protagonist stays to preserve names, with felt cost in the "shoulders ached" and emotional resolution. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of memory and forgiveness tightening through the ritual. Orientation is clear early with "icebound sanctum under aurora."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the chill making the process arduous and the rope encoding processions. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, like "breath sparking like tin shavings." The ice and aurora charge the final image, supporting the theme of preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving forgotten names is signaled early and escalates through protagonist's agency in reconfiguring the rope and casting the names. Under accumulative lens, density increases with each adjustment, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the physical strain and emotional risk, such as "risk the last braid and my guilt."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and forgiveness emerges through concrete actions and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the world brightens for work," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the scar becoming a "lodestar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, such as "technically gentle fingers" and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet coherent, with purposeful compression in lines like "syllables folded into one another like the braids." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "aurora softened like a door left open." Line-level craft supports momentum without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like lost wax casting and punched card memory feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, with a fresh angle on preservation. Specific details, such as the "whale-oil lamp," anchor universals.</comment>
