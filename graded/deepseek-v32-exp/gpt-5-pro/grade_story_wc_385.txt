<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—singing for stolen halves—is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the council's flight and the return of names. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tremor of fear tuned in the council, demonstrating genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist's action unravels the echo commerce, returning names and reconfiguring power dynamics, with cost legible in the council's flight and the shell's final warmth. Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to climax, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of the shell shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choices, such as the serpentine nexus forcing spoken paths and the shell warming to guide actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with the canyon's ribs and metallic air charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the shell and nexus alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from initial singing to confronting the council, with cost unmistakable in the traded voice halves and unraveling commerce. Stakes tighten meaningfully as knowledge deepens, foreclosing the option of passive observation and forcing active intervention. The dominant stake of voice ownership is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—echoes as power, voice as commodity—with subtext in the council's bartering and the shell's revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through harmony and refusal, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through specific images like unmoored syllables and lighter melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature in sound-based imagery and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, with purposeful elision in progressive disclosure paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, carrying subtext in council interactions. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variation, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No significant loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "sibilant thread," but clarity remains uncompromised at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes echoes, memory, and power in a fresh, non-obvious way, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the seashell relic and echo market. Emotional truth is anchored in lived detail, and risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
