<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathy and motivation to welcome nuance are consistently embodied through micro-choices like threading intent along cracks, with the final release of the ampoule earned by prior causality and visible cost in the softening of statues. Interiority is concrete and contradictory, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the ampoule slips out, reconfiguring the city with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with structural weakness methodically paying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater city garden constrains choices and charges the final image through vivid, sensory details like "glassy ferns" and "currents," integrated into action and telepathic communication, with no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cascading revelations tightening the stake of certainty vs. nuance; cost is legible in the release of the ampoule and the city's humming, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to certainty vs. nuance without moralizing; subtext operates in gestures like "fissure is a flute," and the ending reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., "words echo sideways") are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks, but clarity and propulsion remain uncompromised at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of elements like telepathic statues and underwater revelation; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
