<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions. The final choice to not take shadows but close loops is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where shadows are understood as teachers, reweighting the premise with cost. Orientation is clear early, and the accumulative lens holds. The cost is legible in the final image of shadows keeping the isle aloft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with sensory details like "dew from brass rails" and "blackened like burned tea." The observatory and sealed awakenings constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting elements like the brass floor and key shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding shadows escalates through building the model and revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation under the accumulative lens, with cost in the realization that shadows fuel the isle. The choice to close loops forecloses an option with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and imagery, such as shadows as promises and loops. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Earned wisdom arises from specifics like the model and sealed awakenings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "I sweep dew from brass rails." Dialogue with the Archivist is natural and advances plot. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "shadows go to noon to relearn us." Read-aloud test passes with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shadows as teachers and sealed awakenings feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and theme heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific details and character choice.</comment>
