<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to learn belonging is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like using the feather and exhaling with Mara. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "folding doubt into the glow." Mara's relationship forces choices, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in the shared breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with pattern-building toward a resonant reconfiguration—the protagonist's inclusion in the city's rhythm. Closure lands on-page with cost in the "map at last include me" image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens is consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the dome and plankton light alter tactics. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "cool and weighty" night. Micro-setting (burnt feather) recurs to shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of belonging escalates through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens, e.g., exhaling prompts shrimp responses, deepening connection. Cost is legible in the final breathing together, narrowing options from isolation to inclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through particulars like shared exhales and feather use, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the city breathing the protagonist into day, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "stitcher of coastlines." Voice is poetic and consistent under pressure, with rhythmic control in lines like "a hush of shadowseam wonder." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, e.g., "like a lullaby written by engineers," and propulsion is maintained. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes landscape astrology and underwater city with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure is legible with specific detail.</comment>
