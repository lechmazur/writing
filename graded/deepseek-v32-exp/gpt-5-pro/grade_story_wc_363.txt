<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to send the bead instead of vanishing is earned with visible cost, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (sister's return) and felt cost (bead sent, patient waiting). The accumulative/textural lens holds, and orientation is clear early. The jigsaw edges and bead setup pay off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the orchard and bamboo forest constraining choices (e.g., staying to prevent orchard's death). The amber bead and jigsaw edges charge the final image, integrating tightly with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message delivery) is signaled early, escalating through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible when she sends the bead and waits, foreclosing other options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and distance emerges through images and events, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with earned emotional honesty, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., jigsaw mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and information density. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and clear, though slight overwriting risk exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in combining loom spinning, jigsaw edges, and raveling silence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
