<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority (e.g., tasting memories in sweat) and micro-choices under pressure; final planting earned with cost of traded memory, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (seed sprouting charges rebellion theme) under accumulative lens; cost legible in traded memory and effort; orientation clear early, structure tight.</comment>
