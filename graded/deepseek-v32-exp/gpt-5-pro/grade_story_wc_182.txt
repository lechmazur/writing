<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to trade the right to forget is earned by prior causality with visible cost, exemplified in "I renegotiate one last clause, trading my right to forget today for permission to find the library again." Contradictory impulses act in scene when he considers leaving a burden but refrains, reinforcing credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the trade-off and the image of the fern imprint aching "like a chord never struck but vibrating anyway." Causal lens holds strong from inciting incident (time traveler's arrival) to resolution, with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. Persistent constraint of the mountain's rules shapes tactics throughout, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the labyrinthine bookstore pressures navigation through specific paths like "Atlases of Abandoned Journeys." Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV bias (e.g., "shelves breathed in dust and wonder"). The mountain itself functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics, and recurring objects like the botanical diary integrate into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, with clear transitions between areas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescue mission escalates under causal lens through protagonist agency, narrowing options and changing knowledge. The trap in the footnotes tests commitment, and the resolution requires editing silence, driven by researching gaps. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off of "right to forget" and the physical sensation in the palm. One meaningful tightening occurs when the apology written in the diary opens the door, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons and silence emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the "unheard symphony" and the shelves' sigh of approval. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the protagonist's renewed permission and the library's whisper, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars like the apology to the sky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the protagonist's arcane linguist identity. Voice modulates under pressure, using compressed diction in peaks (e.g., "I speak in petal grammar") while maintaining coherence. Purposeful elision, like researching gaps, is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven, as in Palinode's warnings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures that accelerate with scene needs. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle or loops (e.g., "silence, an unheard symphony"). No scaffold or redundancy; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes with natural cadence, though minor ornate phrasing exists but doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of fantasy and literary motifs, transformed through specific details like the library of unlearned lessons and petal grammar. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, with risk-taking in structure and voice that heightens stakes. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
