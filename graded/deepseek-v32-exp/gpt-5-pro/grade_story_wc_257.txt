<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and transformation, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of despair for growth is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the shared exhale and seed sprouting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the group exhale and seed activation. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details like the "brass bones of the dome" and "curtains of intention" that mirror internal states and guide action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes transforming grief into growth. Cost is unmistakable in the mourners' shared breath and the seeds' response, foreclosing despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like lockets and seeds, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext in "grow" as last instructions deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic prose remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "stillness like a lung paused" is coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mourning jewelry, artificial stars, and rebirth with specificity and risk. The non-obvious integration feels inevitable, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
