<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary's interiority is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure, but motivations remain abstract, lacking consistent traits that intensify stakes. The final choice to link scars is earned through prior causality, yet the girl's sudden appearance feels slightly convenient, reducing agency depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as characters step without moving, aligning the covenant with felt cost in "anxious elation." The accumulative/textural lens holds tightly, and orientation is clear early, with the root-binding constraint shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the cobalt glade and maze topiary actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, such as paths waking under grass, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, deepening through the girl's arrival and scar-linking, with cost legible in "trembling joy paced by fear." Stakes are braided and tighten meaningfully, though the initial conflict setup is slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in scars and covenants, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shared wind and becoming "what we were promised," reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, and dialogue (though minimal) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffolds obscure causality; however, minor overwriting in peaks like "anxious elation" slightly muddles clarity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of mystical and temporal themes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in abstract style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and image.</comment>
