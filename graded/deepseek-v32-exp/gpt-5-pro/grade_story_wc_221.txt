<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final act of sending data is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in isolation. Contradictory impulses (blessed pariah) act in scene, and closure choice is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in the act of sending the pattern and the fuller silence. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. Structure from setup to exploration is coherent, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices (e.g., temporal gradients affecting perception) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the deck and compass rose shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding drift vs. fear) escalates through protagonist's agency in sketching and rerouting power, under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in isolation and the act of defiance. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of true north as internal guidance emerges through particulars (compass, sketching, drift) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the valley's hum, reweighting prior confusion. Subtext in silence and echoes deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with elision taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; diction matches the reflective, time-aware narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax, with no loops or scaffolds harming closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "shadow, temporally stretched like a black rope." Read-aloud rhythm supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation and personal conviction feels inevitable, with specific details transforming tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and conceptual integrity are strong.</comment>
