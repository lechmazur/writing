<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Motivation to preserve lost songs is clear and intensifies through Ezra's request, compelling higher-stakes choices. Backstory is anchored in the present and tilts stance via the decision to trust again. Minor summary in past trauma does not undermine the earned renunciation at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Earned Stasis—the narrator's continued role reconfigures meaning with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure (present scene with backstory shards) is taught and pays off. Causality is tight, with the meteorite chip and dust motes as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with sensory details like dust motes and skylight constraining choices and charging the final image. The attic functions as micro-setting, pressuring navigation and trust. Economy of detail is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust escalates through Ezra's request, forcing the narrator's agency in sending Thimble.

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events without moralizing, with subtext in gestures like Ezra's silence.

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control.
