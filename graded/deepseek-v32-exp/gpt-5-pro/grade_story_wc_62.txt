<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "listens before any chisel dares to speak." Final choice to loosen the braid is earned by spectral guidance and prior causality, with visible cost in faces relaxing. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as meditative patience versus the urgency of collective grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the stone receives and the community gathers, with cost legible in "faces relaxed as if a long held breath had found a doorway." Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and repetition. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; the greenhouse "breathed approval" and shapes the carving process through its environment. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, e.g., "fogged with the breath of plants older than the village." Micro-setting elements like the ribbon and stone alter tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering collective grief escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases, e.g., tying ribbons to carving channels. Protagonist agency drives escalation, guided by spectral mentorship, with cost visible in the stone's reception. One meaningful tightening occurs when the braid is loosened, foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the ribbon braid and poem customs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Subtext operates in spectral mentorship and rituals. Final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature; voice is meditative and poetic, e.g., "slow of hand and fiercely meditative." Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, e.g., "the blows were gentle thunder, a private storm under glass." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; syntax varies purposefully. Read-aloud rhythm is natural and supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, memory, and spectral mentorship feels inevitable; specific details like butterfly migration and ribbon roll heighten stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in quiet narrative pays off with coherence and emotional truth.</comment>
