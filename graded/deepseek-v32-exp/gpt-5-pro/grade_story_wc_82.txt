<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to fold grief into cranes is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "dress in ache, a brightness that cuts"; final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the shadow returns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Resonant Reconfiguration as the shadow returns and balance is realized, carrying felt cost; Accumulative lens holds through density of imagery; orientation is clear early with "floating island tea garden" and "I am the crafty lantern maker."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the floating island and glass basilica shape the protagonist's actions; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "tea garden smells briefly of rain on iron"; micro-setting (gems, lanterns) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with folding cranes and polishing gems increasing density; cost is legible in the transformation of grief, e.g., "the torment shifts, still luminous"; dominant stake of balance tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief and transformation emerges through particulars like origami cranes and lanterns, not direct statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer with "a living is the art of folding brightness without breaking it"; subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "I wake without silhouette and dress in ache"; elision is taught and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, as in "dreams precipitate there like dew on stone"; sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of grief and magic realism, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, e.g., the shadow's return transforms the concept; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
