<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motives are clear and rooted in service and love, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation in the forgetter room is earned by diary revelations with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (placing items in forgetter room) and felt cost under accumulative lens; orientation is clear early, and lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency in reading the diary, tightening stakes under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the final act of delivery and renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of affectionate detachment emerges through events and images, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in diary deepens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and enhances momentum, though minor overwriting exists without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (elevator, diary, goggles) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth is specific.</comment>
