<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and starved, driving choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion like "sweeping rust from a floor of star maps." Kestrel's growth adds relational pressure, but internal contradictions are underdeveloped, limiting peak complexity. Final endurance is earned with visible cost in the portico damage and Kestrel's injury.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as council blinks and Kestrel joins; cost is legible in "spidered but standing" portico and burned halo. Causal-hybrid lens holds strong, with events like riddles leading to council opposition and final broadcast. Orientation is clear early, and persistent storm constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "lightning stitched silver seams" and cobalt portico that constrains choices by bending lightning. Micro-setting (antennas, kite) alters tactics and charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: narrator's broadcasts provoke council, leading to cutters and traitors, with Kestrel taking a hit. Cost is unmistakable in Kestrel's injury and portico damage, tightening options under causal lens. Dominant stake of shaping dawn is tested throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars like ancient shadows and variant allegiance, with subtext in images such as "keep the strings visible." Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through the plan to steer by thunder without worshiping it, avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature is selective, e.g., "stormlight crawled." Rhythmic control under pressure with patterned elision taught early. No head-hopping; voice modulates with gritty whimsy, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, advancing story through lines like "edited the next broadcast with a tinker joy." No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally. Some metaphors are ambitious but voice-motivated, without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like stormlit observatory and fragmented radio frequencies feels inevitable; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes. Transformation of prophet trope through specific details like Kestrel's tin kite avoids derivative premises, supporting coherence.</comment>
