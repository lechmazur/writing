<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as turning the valve wheel with beads "biting my skin." The narrator's motivation to find "the weight of a swallowed truth" drives the plot, and the final stance—carrying the truth—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain from the mother's confession to the discovery in the tunnel, with closure as a Decisive Change: the ledger and tag reconfigure the narrator's understanding. The Causal lens holds, and cost is legible in "I felt my own life click, teeth meeting teeth." Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressure-driven, with the tunnel and valve wheel constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "rails slick with old grease" and "drip from a seam" are filtered through the narrator's bias, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled as finding the truth about the father, and escalation is driven by the narrator's agency—interpreting calls, turning the wheel—under the Causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the discovery of the ledger and the narrator's altered stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the "column of zeros" in the ledger representing erased lives, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to truth and legacy through the final realization and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness") and controlled diction. First-person POV remains stable, and any elision (e.g., the father's fate) is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language, like "swallowed by it like a prayer," is coherent and purposeful, and propulsion remains clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of the "factory ghost shift" is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical compression and thematic depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
