<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal conflict is embodied through trembling hands and arguing breath, with micro-choices like decrypting the cast and calling Kellan revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to save oneself from becoming like Kellan is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in "hands shaking, not to save him from consequences but to save myself." Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where the protagonist asserts identity and reconfigures power dynamics, with cost felt in the confrontation and the image of watching the film together. Causal lens holds strong from discovery to confrontation, driven by protagonist agency. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the seashell and cast persist as constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting charges the final image with the rusted library's rotten boards enabling the trap and the skylight allowing constellation alignment. Sensory details like "pages flaking like scabs" are selective and POV-filtered, reflecting urgency. The library constrains choice by providing resources (projector, safe tiles) that alter outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from decrypting the cast to calling Kellan and setting the trap. Dominant stake of identity and truth tightens through meaningful turns, with cost visible in the confrontation and the protagonist's shaken hands. The climax forces a trade-off between vulnerability and power, foreclosing old paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through particulars like the seashell's whisper and the child's cast cipher, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "ruin is another name for an honest beginning," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as not stopping Kellan from switching the projector.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose like "pages flaking like scabs" and "breath arguing with itself." Voice modulates with pressure, maintaining coherence under stress. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in lines like "You never would have been Jax."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent, e.g., "cracked and let light in," with no muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained through concrete action and image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of stunt double betrayal transformed through specific details like the seashell cipher and library setting. Emotional truth is specific and memorable, with risk-taking in poetic prose heightening stakes. The non-obvious integration of elements feels inevitable in hindsight, supporting closure.</comment>
