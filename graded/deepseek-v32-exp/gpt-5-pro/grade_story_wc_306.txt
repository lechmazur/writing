<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The protagonist's role as a conscience for hire is coherent, but minor abstraction in her motivation slightly limits depth. The final choice to sign with conditions is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. The wind chime method and mirror shard reweight options, and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through POV. The environment pressures tactics, such as the chimes influencing Mara's decision. Specificity is high, and the setting evolves consistently with the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with the stake tightening through the wind chime translations and mirror shard use. Cost is legible in Mara's exhale and the cloak's removal. One meaningful deepening reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the cloak of doubt and hollow mirror, offering a resonant non-literal answer to certainty vs. nuance. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and implication, with complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; voice coherence under pressure supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language purposeful and legible. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "coded clicks," but no artifacts that obscure causality. Closure image remains clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of a conscience for hire is fresh and synthesized with specific elements like wind chimes and cloak of doubt. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids templates.</comment>
