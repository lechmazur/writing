<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in logical dreaming, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., setting a mirror among shells). Interiority is concrete, but internal conflict is subtle rather than deeply contradictory. Final choice to include self as variable is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure via Conceptual Repricing (hope equation) lands with cost in community revival. Orientation is clear early; parallel timelines integrate seamlessly without causality breaks. Persistent constraint (gauge) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (decorations as patterns) and charging the final image. Sensory details (e.g., "resonant pulse") reflect POV bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalizing hope) escalates accumulatively through protagonist-driven exchanges and trial balloons. Cost is legible in gauge's rise and community gathering. Agency narrows options without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope as collective attention emerges through particulars (e.g., children singing, exchanges). Ending offers non-literal answer via equation without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like laying down charred oar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "lucidly watchful"). Lyrical prose modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present (e.g., neighbors' actions).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("tide that lifts all boats") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; read-aloud test passes smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes parallel timelines and hope equations with inevitability. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Specificity in details (e.g., altitude gauge) avoids template plots; closure feels fresh and integrated.</comment>
