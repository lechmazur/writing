<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to thaw mistrust is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion (fingers shaking from recognition) and a earned choice to reveal truth, foreclosing quiet endurance with visible cost in confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with Rell's admission and protagonist's confession, costing their prior peace, anchored early in the museum setting and lens discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges closure: the forecourt hosts the revelation, the lens and tickets are micro-settings that shape tactics, with vivid sensory details like humming steps and hissing tiles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal doubt to public truth through protagonist's agency (using lens, displaying doodles), with cost legible in Rell's resignation and the cellist's marking of harm rerouted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("seeing together can be truer than speaking alone") that reweights prior concealment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single PVO is stable with distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature; elision like "after words become unnecessary" is taught and paid off, with rhythmic control under pressure and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language (e.g., "humming like bowls") enhances without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of truth and memory in a museum setting, with specific details like lens and doodles transforming tropes; risk-taking in silent resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
