<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's gentle persistence is embodied in micro-choices like tapping the bell without ringing it, and the collective "we" POV shows contradictory impulses during Noor and Farid's conflict. The final renunciation of names is earned through the midnight run, where intergenerational support is dramatized with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are filtered through specific, concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with the community enduring sanctions and reaffirming anonymity, cost legible in "sanctions stayed, but so did we." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of quiet work and the bell's recurrence. Orientation is clear within 120 words with the terra-cotta arbor and exile community setup. No causality breaks; the bell's evolution from donation bowl to symbolic object charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The antique silver bell constrains choices and charges the final image, functioning as micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "stars floating in it like distant coins." Atmosphere of amplified quiet is woven into action, supporting theme. Spatial choreography in midnight runs is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival and community cohesion escalates under accumulative lens through Noor's doubt and Farid's accusation, resolved by Mara's plan braiding their routes. Agency is in shared work, leading to intergenerational support with cost visible in the carried "impatience like fire." One meaningful tightening occurs when the run forces character growth and reaffirms anonymity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity and community emerges through events like the bell's use and the midnight run, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures, such as breathing across the bell instead of ringing it. Final image of the note ("We give and receive as the same hands") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars of the shared experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature like "amplified quiet" modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent through turns, with purposeful elision in the note's revelation. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present, e.g., Mara's declarations. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but purposeful, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught, e.g., the bell's recurrence. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally, accelerating in action beats like the food runs. No artifacts affect closure; clarity is maintained even in peak moments like Mara's declaration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of community resistance through specific details like the bell and anonymous donations feels inevitable. Risk-taking in first-person plural and quiet tone heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and setting. No derivative premise; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
