<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with motives rooted in silence and empathy. Micro-choices under pressure, such as using the mirror without speaking, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of speech is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the wordless resolution. Contradictory impulses act in scene, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early, anchoring who, where, and when. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The rescue lands with cost in the silent empathy and the guardian's upheld vow. Closure is legible and charged, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like the "cobalt dock" and "shutters" filtering through POV. The environment constrains choices, as the canal and mirror directly shape the rescue. The final image is charged by the recurring object (mirror) and setting elements. Spatial choreography is coherent and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing the brother) is signaled early and escalates through the guardian's agency with the mirror and shutters. Under the accumulative lens, density increases, reweighting options with cost in the silent effort. The escalation is driven by protagonist choices, and the cost is legible in the wordless interaction. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through events and images, not direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures like the boy's pointed silence and the mirror's light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice is consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., the vow) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control and diction reflect the guardian's mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without padding. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained. The final image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a silent guardian using a dental mirror is fresh and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific details. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric mode heightening stakes. Emotional specificity and authenticity of vision cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
