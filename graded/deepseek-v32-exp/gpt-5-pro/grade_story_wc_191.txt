<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in personal stakes, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to claim stewardship is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the nostalgic ache and urgency. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her hesitation balanced with determination, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal drive with tight linkages; orientation is established early. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (stewardship begins) and felt cost (nostalgia and dawn's answer), under a hybrid lens dominant at the end. The persistent constraint of time and memory shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the orchard and waterfall constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "colors tasted like childhood circuitry" are purposeful and filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing throne's fall) escalates under causal drive through time pressure and discoveries, driven by Maris's agency. Cost is legible in the countdown and her nostalgic pain, with one meaningful tightening that narrows options to the final climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and stewardship emerges through events and images, not statement, with a resonant non-literal answer in the throne as a "radio made of rain." Subtext operates in implication, such as the orchard's speech, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic prose like "waterfall looked like a column of falling windows" is voice-motivated, and any elision (e.g., murals rearranging) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats, though minor density in imagery doesn't obscure clarity. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in a non-obvious synthesis of futuristic and nostalgic elements, with specific details like cassette notches and broadcast fruit. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
