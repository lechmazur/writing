<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "grim optimist" trait drives consistent micro-choices under pressure, with embodied contradiction in climbing as both bruising and salvageable. Final endurance on the staircase is earned by prior causality of the dice roll refusal, with cost legible in the metallic taste of missed chances. Interiority avoids stock phrasing through specific, character-particular images like "chalk of my memory."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist ascends with proof, reconfiguring motion into obligation with felt cost in "texture under my tongue." Orientation is clear within 120 words; staircase pattern taught early pays off in the final bargain and ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Infinite staircase setting constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that pressures tactics. Sensory details are vivid and selective, like "smell of rain and copier toner," filtered through POV bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent across climbs and dice rolls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity's texture) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in proofs and dice rolls, tightening into the bargain that reweights options. Cost is unmistakable in "duty sustained by regret" and the iron taste, foreclosing paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the chipped dice and staircase, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure: "a missed opportunity becomes something I can almost hold." Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending mathematical and poetic diction. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision in proofs is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control is evident in lines like "balancedly daring, never lunging into the void."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, e.g., "staircase refunds the heart." Minor overwriting in peaks like "boundless confinement accepts me" does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of infinite staircase, mathematical proofs, and dice transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with freshness in the "texture of a missed opportunity."</comment>
