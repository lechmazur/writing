<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, driving investigation and final choice. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "miracles make me itch." Micro-choices under pressure, like stepping into the stillpoint, reveal values. Final endurance in truth-telling has visible cost, though internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with logical progression from myth to discovery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where truth reconfigures the miracle's meaning, with cost legible in the ethical dilemma of omitting names. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with sensory details like "dust blew red" filtering through POV. The stillpoint and orchard pressure choices, constraining movement and charging the final image. Environmental details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. comfort escalates through protagonist's agency: entering stillpoint, reassembling letters, holding diamond. Meaningful tightening forces trade-off in final decision, with cost felt in Klay's request. Coherent pressure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. engineered comfort emerges through particulars like the diamond's role and shredded letters. Subtext in Klay's dialogue and the stillpoint imagery. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "trees drink" ticking. Voice is precise and rhythmic, modulating under pressure. Dialogue natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Klay's exchanges. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with varied syntax, strong verbs, and purposeful figurative language. High information density advances story without loops or muddles. Minor register consistency in peak beats, but clarity and propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, blending sci-fi and literary elements with specific details like the flawed diamond as engineering. Tropes transformed through grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
