<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with "gloomy cheerfulness" embodied; final apology is earned by prior causality and alters the past with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change (apology forgiving the past) with felt cost under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is clear early, and the ephemeral compass constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (observatory, cello, seashell) constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the dome and tools shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using the cello and seashell to force a personal reconciliation with cost legible in the apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the universal riddle without moralizing; subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught and paid off, though some dense phrasing slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion with varied syntax; no loops or scaffolds, but minor figurative density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of myth-busting and resonant communication; specific details and risk-taking in style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
