<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cryptic bell tuner and narrator exhibit concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, with the final commitment to "keep time" earned through embodied experience. Contradictory impulses, like the boy's error and correction, are dramatized in scene. The closure choice carries visible cost in the narrator's promise, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the narrator's vow and the town's revival. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through rhythmic patterns to a decisive change. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the cost is legible in "I promised to keep time for the city."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the archway and cobblestones constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "smoke-dark hum" are selective and POV-filtered. The environment actively pressures tactics, such as stones "listening for the downbeat," meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the walking ritual intensifying stakes through setbacks like the boy's stamping. Cost is visible in physical changes (mortar seam loosening) and the narrator's commitment. The dominant stake of restoring balance tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like footsteps "braiding." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "Balance is not a throne... but a chorus of feet," reweighting prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "our soles touching the stone with a mercy I had never rehearsed." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language, like "a black gull on tide," is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost town revival with rhythmic rebuilding is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded details like the tuning fork and footsteps.</comment>
