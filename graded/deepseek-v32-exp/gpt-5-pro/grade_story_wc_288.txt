<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority embodied in "Tone: None" and micro-choices under pressure. The final stance of coexistence is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the renunciation of reunion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "I felt no pull stronger than my chosen balance." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the sundial's role in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices (e.g., library tides steered by sundial) and charges the final image with the "threshold" beacon. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the sundial and stone circle constraining actions and enriching atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, using the sundial to deepen stakes and achieve independence. Cost is unmistakable in the vow and coexistence without reunion, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of isolation transforming into independence emerges through particulars like the sundial and ledger, with subtext in gestures with the Librarian. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in rhythmic prose and perceptual signature (e.g., "atomically reflective"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes original elements (tidal library, reincarnation memory) with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and transformation is grounded in character.</comment>
