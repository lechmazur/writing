<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through synesthesia and embodied emotion. Rowan's change is earned through the echoes, and micro-choices under pressure reveal values. Minor weakness: Rowan's despair could be more dramatized, but the closure choice has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Rowan decides to act, cost legible in her tears and renewed hope. The accumulative lens holds, with echoes building pressure. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from the ghost's actions to Rowan's change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the orchard and maze constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and filtered through the ghost's synesthetic perception, enhancing atmosphere without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: Rowan's loss of possibility versus regained courage. Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency in producing echoes, leading to a tightening that forecloses despair with cost on page. Under the accumulative lens, density increases effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and echoes emerges through images and actions, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with subtext in Rowan's dialogue and the orchard's response, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic voice that controls rhythm and perception under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of ghost, synesthesia, and mystic orchard, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
