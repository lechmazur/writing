<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief and atonement, driving higher-stakes choices like building the bridge. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as the chrysalis as a "metronome for her grief." The reconciliation with her brother feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her loosened grief. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like her treating people as reactions yet seeking connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkages: her insight from the ravine leads to polymer design and the bridge, culminating in a decisive change with the brother's visit and shared step. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (grief loosening, chrysalis sinking), and the lens holds. Orientation is clear early, with who, where, and when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The braided ravine is vividly described and constrains choices, inspiring polymer design and charging the final image of the river mouth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "froth along split channels" and "hissed like a stage whisper." Micro-setting (chrysalis, polymer filaments) alters tactics and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnecting with her brother escalates through her agency: building the bridge and messaging him. Cost is legible in her grief and the risk of the bridge test. Under the causal lens, one meaningful tightening occurs when he responds and they step together, foreclosing isolation with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of separation, connection, and atonement emerge through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the chrysalis sinking and "loosened grief." Subtext operates in gestures, like the brother turning the chrysalis and their shared laughter. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV from Mira is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and poetic diction. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "counting rests where the streams sank underground." No head-hopping; elision (e.g., brother's silence) is taught and pays off in reconciliation. Rhythmic control is evident in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, like "nerves remembering a song." No muddle in peak beats; closure image is sharp. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of polymer chemistry, personal grief, and natural patterns feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric-scientific blend. Premise is transformed through specific choices, e.g., polymers that "zip and unzip like a social fabric." No template plots; authenticity of vision coheres throughout.</comment>
