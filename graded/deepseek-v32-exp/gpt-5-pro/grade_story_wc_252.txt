<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the arc. The final renunciation of performance is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the release of whispers. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as combative tenderness toward the sea, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost when the protagonist plants the scrimshaw and understands the need to walk away. The drive lens holds consistently, and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, fulfilling the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as seen in the sublittoral fringe guiding the skiff journey and the island's woven raft breathing truth. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, such as detaching from the pier and planting the scrimshaw, with cost legible in the release of guarded hearts. The dominant stake of freedom versus performance tightens meaningfully through the journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, like the scrimshaw carving apologies and the island refusing ownership, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the whale call shaping paths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that reflects the protagonist's worldview. Rhythm and diction control heighten pressure, as in "moon jellies write their slow cursive," and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, such as "the harbor flats boom with that whale note," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements uniquely, with the post-violence world and disappearing island feeling inevitable in hindsight.
