<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and internal conflict shown in scene. The final choice to stay in the memory is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the stitching imagery. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "break in me begins to stitch." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern shifts from mangrove to hospital deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks affect closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like "air tastes like copper" constraining choices. The mangrove labyrinth and houseboat pressure tactics, and key objects (shard, letters) charge the final image. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the evocation action tightening stakes. Cost is legible in the emotional healing and foreclosed paths. Dominant stake (finding the moment) is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the unsent letters and brother's gesture, offering a non-literal answer to forgiveness. Subtext operates in silence and image, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet precise, with purposeful compression in shifts like "mangrove turning to hallway." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no muddle in peak beats. Sentences propel momentum, and closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits feels organic and inevitable. Bold risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
