<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in spiritual curiosity; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as the bellows stitched to ribs. The final choice to heal without owning is earned through the breathing method, with visible cost in the reconfigured relationship to unused love. Minor weakness: internal conflict is more realization than contradiction, but micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist learns to heal without owning, with cost legible in the final image of "unused love is a lamp waiting for its oil." Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern of breathing changes intensifying to charge the ending. Orientation is clear early with viaduct and box anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the twilight viaduct constraining choices and charging the final image through arches and fog. Sensory details like "fog collecting in the longer stones" are filtered through POV, and the viaduct functions as micro-setting that alters tactics. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens through protagonist's agency in breathing changes, deepening to a reweighting with cost in the "ache to flow" becoming light. Pressure coheres via density increase in imagery and cadence shifts, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unused love and healing emerges organically from particulars like the kwan yin's tear and breathing method, with subtext in gestures (e.g., "handing me the old kettle of steam"). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of love stored in breath, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "my breath opens the aperture, then closes it like a tide." Voice is poetic yet coherent under pressure; minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "a pilgrim of sparks writing constellations." No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; clarity and momentum are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like camera obscura art and spiritual inquiry feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (e.g., kwan yin's tear) transform familiar tropes through grounded choices, and closure reconfigures meaning.</comment>
