<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Final choice to witness rather than bind is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the scribe reconfigures their role, with cost legible in the decision to preserve the "map of feeling." Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., orchard leaning closer, phonograph shaving charging the final image). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the skyscraper orchard and tools integral to pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving emotional patterns vs. binding oaths) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase; prophecy revelation forces a choice with agency, and cost is felt in the exposure risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; ending offers a non-literal answer to the nature of oaths through the scribe's stance shift. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., third-grade memory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction is character-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing oath-scribing, phonograph technology, and skyscraper orchard with organic integration. Risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
