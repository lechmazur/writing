<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., untangling ropes) revealing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of fixed reality for fragmented honor is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the beam's kindness. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the beam crowns the lens, reconfiguring her vocation with felt cost. Orientation is clear early; pattern taught through imagery pays off. Persistent constraint of the tangled ropes shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse library constrains choice (ropes require untangling) and charges the final image (beam sweep). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "dust bodied itself into sentences"). Spatial choreography coherent, with setting evolving through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation via density increase (untangling threads) reweights dominant stake of redesigning perception. Protagonist agency drives deepening; cost is legible in the beam's "measured kindness" and her opened internal space. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—fragmented reality honored through tarot and lighthouse imagery—without moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer ("art is its book room") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic syntax and rhythm control under pressure (e.g., "fogbones of the day kept knocking"). No head-hopping; elision taught and paid off. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, supporting accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "luminescent ache" repeated) causes minor density without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds; clarity and propulsion maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse, tarot, and artist tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
