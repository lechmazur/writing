<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion under pressure. Micro-choices, like coaxing the apple and offering succor, reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with decisive change (seed planting restores color) and resonant reconfiguration under Hybrid lens; cost is legible in Gray's transformation. Causality is strong with because/therefore linkages, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV; parapet and waterfall constrain choices (e.g., pruning affects world). Micro-setting like shears and seed charge the final image, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Hybrid lens, with stakes tightening through actions like crossing the bridge and confronting Gray. Cost is legible in the offering of hunger and light, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via seed planting and Gray's transformation. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor density in metaphors but clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of orchard pruner weaving between worlds feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise is transformed through specific detail and moral calculus.</comment>
