<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and embodied through specific objects and actions, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of numbness is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as Lena's internal shift and the drum's use with students reweight emotional stakes with visible cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern and filament of hush constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Lena's POV to create a cohesive atmosphere that actively shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Lena's agency with the drum and backward songs, tightening emotional stakes until the cost of overcoming numbness is legible in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to emotional numbness via the drum's lesson, avoiding moralizing while resonating with subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; elision (e.g., "audibly muted") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats like the drum's response.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, drum-making, and backward songs feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in lyrical abstraction that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
