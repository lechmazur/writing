<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation to "turn obstacles into instruments" is deeply rooted in his past trauma and embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as assigning tasks to trees. His internal conflict between defiance and conversation with the sea is shown in scene, not summary, and his final stance crystallizes with visible cost. The vow from his youth returns as a bassline, earning the resonant reconfiguration at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the wave passing through the ring and the prophet's reflection on conversation. The cost is legible in the image of the orchard "loosening its posture" and the recorded pattern for future storms. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the fractal generating method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting constrains choices and charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that shapes tactics through lashings, roots, and bottles. Sensory details like "salt wind" and "sap move like sea within a sea" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment evolves causally with the wave's approach, and the blue hour timeframe tightens decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the prophet's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with his fractal strikes persuading the wave to change shape. The dominant stake of turning obstacles into instruments tightens through timed delays and tuned defiance, leading to a cost legible in the "field of foams applauding." No coincidence resolves the conflict; the wave's passage is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the prophet's actions and the recurring image of "sketched resonance," offering a non-literal answer to conversing with nature rather than conquering it. Subtext operates in gestures like naming the ring "Tympanum" and the wave "remembering another shape." The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through the concept of bartering with weather.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm that modulates with pressure, such as "fractal, repeating a slow figure." Voice remains consistent under stress, and elision (e.g., cloud interpretations) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the prophet's internal texture coheres throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; sentences like "The swell listened, or seemed to" advance story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, with no register drift or scaffolding. The closure image is sharp, and syntax propels momentum, as in the cascade of strikes meeting the swell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes unique elements—a tide prophet on a floating orchard using sound to dialogue with waves—into an inevitable, non-obvious whole. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept of "sketched resonance" transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. The final image feels earned and indelibly fresh.</comment>
