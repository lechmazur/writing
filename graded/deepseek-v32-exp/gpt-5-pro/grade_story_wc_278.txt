<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt over the nephew's death, with interiority embodied in phrases like "Guilt set like frost inside my chest." The final choice to tattoo the name is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation of guilt has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist achieves peace, cost legible in "the fold smooths like silk." Orientation is clear early, and the self-forgiveness arc is coherent with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with details like "meteor hush" and "amber with an insect" constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, integrating into action and theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency, such as using the amber and tattooing the name, with cost visible in the lab's exhale and the protagonist's weightlessness. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and forgiveness emerges through events and images like the amber and constellations, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the tether of ink, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "fans answer with a tide of mothlight." Perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., time folds) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, as in "waveform writes itself, then crosses out its name," advancing story without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of elements like haunted firmware and constellation tattooing, transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
