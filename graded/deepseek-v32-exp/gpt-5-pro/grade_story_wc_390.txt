<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "reason braided with ache and oath." The Collector's change feels earned through vibrational matching, and micro-choices under stress reveal values. Final renunciation is credible with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds with because/therefore linkages; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the Collector's departure and key cooling reconfigure meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: "the crypt keeper's key cooling to the temperature of trust." Orientation is clear early, and lens coherence supports the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: "drift-ice marina" and vault environment constrain actions and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "brittle chimes" and "salt sweat," filtered through POV. Recurring objects (key, ice) deepen atmosphere without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting the artifact) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens; the Collector's threat forces a demonstration, leading to a tightening where cost is felt in emotional release. Escalation is meaningful, with visible price in the Collector's weeping and protagonist's shame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absolution emerges through events and images, not statement; subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the Collector's collapsed scaffolding. Ending offers a non-literal answer with clarity as "the only kindness," resisting moralizing. Resonance arises from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, e.g., "a brass heartbeat asking me to be worthy." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with subtext. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent, like "comb time like wet hair." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept of "sonic absolution" is fresh and integrated, transforming tropes through specific choices; emotional specificity avoids templates. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
