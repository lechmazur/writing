<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like "hazy precision" and adapting steps. The final choice to draft an order is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though contradictory impulses are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (drafting the order) that reconfigures the system, with cost legible in the implemented changes. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through details to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens is consistent without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, as wind patterns in the container labyrinth directly affect the accident and investigation. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, charging the final image with the "breathing grid." Environmental pressure shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening as the investigation reveals the cause. Cost is legible in the order that alters the maze, foreclosing options. Dominant stake of preventing future accidents is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of foresight vs. hindsight emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in the silence and the patch as a symbol. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "safer habit" without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic prose that reflects the investigator's mindset. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., "hazy precision") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is integrated without muddle, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build. Closure image is clear and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of accident investigation with wind pattern documentation feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
