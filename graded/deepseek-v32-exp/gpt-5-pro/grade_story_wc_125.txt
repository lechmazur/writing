<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to discover the texture of time is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices like braiding the rope revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to trade a poem instead of the map is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in foreclosing the path of traveling blind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the escapee's release and the whale's transformation, costing the poet's map but preserving the rope. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The cost is legible in the line "the second thins, the grotto air rippling," showing a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto, mural whale, and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like "the cliffs breathe like shells" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the poet's POV. The environment pressures tactics, such as using the grotto for the ritual and the rope for mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of impossible choices escalates through the poet's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when the visitors and escapee demand trades. Cost is visible in the poet's decision to braid knowledge rather than surrender the map, foreclosing an option with felt consequence. Pressure coheres until the final act reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, such as the rope remembering tension and the whale learning release, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to time's texture. Subtext operates in gestures like the poet listening harder, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with the insight that "we learn by uncovering layers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, as in "the rope shudders, pulling on years like beads." Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "trailing breath like torn silk" is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes energy beings, a poet, and metaphysical concepts in a fresh, non-obvious way. Risks with lyric style heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable. Specific details like the rope and mural are organic to character and conflict, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
