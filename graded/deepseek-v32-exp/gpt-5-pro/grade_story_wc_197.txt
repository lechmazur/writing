<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jessa's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like using the key and bridging wires. Her resourcefulness is shown through concrete actions, but interior contradiction is minimal, making her slightly one-dimensional under pressure. The final choice to kick the relay is earned with visible risk, though lacks deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the lagoon flares to reveal erased memories, costing Jessa and her contact their safety. Causal drive holds tightly from key use to memory injection. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the key shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the auric lagoon and puddle reflections constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "chiming key" and "glowing water" are purposeful and filtered through Jessa's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under causal lens as Jessa's agency—bridging wires, kicking the relay—narrows options and forces a trade-off with the squads. Cost is legible when the flare risks capture, though the resolution is swift, slightly reducing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance against indifference emerges organically through images like the key and lagoon, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer in "stubbornness is a kind of love." No moralizing; subtext in gestures and silence enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction ("flicker like prompts") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Elision in puddle maps is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language like "molting snakes" is coherent and voice-motivated. Closure image remains sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dystopian tropes with unique elements like puddle maps and phone key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
