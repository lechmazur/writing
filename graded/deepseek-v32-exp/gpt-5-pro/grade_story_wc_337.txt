<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The restorer's internal conflict (e.g., fearing to see their own face in broken masks) and relationship with the daughter reveal character under pressure, earning the final renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the untying of knots leading to the coffer's rise and the spirit's grounding, costing the restorer a new promise. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with cost legible in the daughter's repetition of the name and the restorer's reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the prism sanctuary and its objects (e.g., the net, coffer) constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV, and the environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the untying of knots increasing density and reweighting stakes. The cost is unmistakable in the daughter's tremor and the restorer's request for the sack, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending and release emerges organically from events and images, such as the needle and net, with subtext in shared secrets. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the stars leaning closer, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, rhythmic prose. Voice modulates under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the sanctuary's listening) is taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle in peak beats, and sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a mask restorer in a prism sanctuary offers a fresh synthesis, transforming tropes through specific details like the unraveling knots. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
