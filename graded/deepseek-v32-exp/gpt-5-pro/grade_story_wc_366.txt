<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's reticence and observant nature are consistently embodied, driving micro-choices like not answering Doyle and culminating in the lantern creation with visible cost; internal conflict is shown in silence during goodbye, and final renunciation is earned by prior causality of letters and automation threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern of letters, stones, and sea glass building to a resonant reconfiguration closure; cost is legible in "luminescent ache" image, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lantern room as micro-setting constrains choice (climbing alone) and charges the final image; sensory details like "tide wrote its cursive" are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving human connection escalates under accumulative lens through density increase (automation threat, Doyle's sadness) to protagonist's agential choice to create the lantern; cost is unmistakable in the final image's "ache."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. technology emerges from particulars like letters and stones, with subtext in gestures (Doyle's averted gaze); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lantern image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant" diction); voice remains coherent under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., silent goodbye) pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control (e.g., "lights die like people"); no loops or scaffold, and figurative language like "luminescent ache" is clear and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of automation and human connection through specific details (sea glass, stone messages); risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and closure feels inevitable with charged reconfiguration.</comment>
