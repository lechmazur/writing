<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like following rumors and trading. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "smiled in a desperately jocular way," with embodied emotion. The final choice to leave the moon rock is earned by prior causality, showing cost in her feeling "seen only by their needs." No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens: crisis becomes community, with cost legible in "loneliness still prowled, but now it had fewer places to hide." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraint of reciprocity shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the disused railway station and ivy pressuring choices as a hub for interaction. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "ivy liked her." The moon rock as a micro-setting object charges the final image when left for the ivy, constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curing loneliness is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, e.g., following rumors and catalyzing community. Cost is legible in the traded efforts and the community's formation. One meaningful tightening occurs as the rumor chain leads to a queue and market.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the moon rock as an "excuse" for connection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loneliness through the community's emergence, without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "listened to rumors like birds." Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "like a joke sent ahead to catch a falling person." No artifacts obscure causality or closure; sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of disaster relief and loneliness, transformed through specific choices like rumor chains and reciprocity. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure and tone that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
