<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's boredom and dimensional awareness are concretely embodied, driving micro-choices like orchestrating Mara's betrayal to achieve spatial mutiny. The final transfer of the curse is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in Mara's new burden. Mara's secondary role is functional but lacks deep interiority, though this doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from the amulet's tug to the negotiated pact and double-cross. Closure is a decisive change: the protagonist walks away after transferring the curse, with cost legible in "my name loosened in the ledger of days." Orientation is anchored early by setting and stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vividly sensory and constrain choices, such as using copper coils for magnetic fields. The setting charges the final image as "prisms misaligned their rainbows," directly enabling the spatial mutiny. Selective detail reflects the immortal's POV, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early ("discover what happens after goodbye") and escalate through protagonist agency, like nudging coils to braid shadows. Cost is unmistakable when the fragment slips its allegiance to Mara, foreclosing his immortality. Pressure tightens causally under the lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's quest, with subtext in Mara's betrayal and the final answer that "after goodbye... is attention waiting without demand." The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal resolution through the corridor image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("dimensionally aware sight traced lines between rooms"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and dialogue (e.g., Mara's introduction) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("like a tooth in dream") is consistent and purposeful, and closure is sharpened by concise, image-driven lines like "the corridor lifted me like a tide with ears."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes immortality, spatial mutiny, and magnetic fields with originality, avoiding tropes through specific details like the cursed amulet's magnetic response. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure pays off, and the integration feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
