<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is embodied through sensory details like "fog nests inside my chest," and the final choice to use silence is earned by the teacher's lesson, with visible cost in the ongoing duty. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as resisting the code's lure, aligning with high-band criteria.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis under the accumulative/textural lens, with the prophecy hushed temporarily and cost legible in the effort and cyclical return; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the final image of carrying the "empty frame home."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the grotto's "prism atrium" splitting the note, charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the environment actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing the prophecy escalates through protagonist agency, using silence to resist the code's promises; cost is unmistakable in the temporary resolution and ongoing cycle, with a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. sound emerges through particulars like the "vested hush" and negative space, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure without moralizing; subtext operates in imagery and implication, deepening emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision taught early; voice remains coherent and poetic, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful; minor overwriting in dense metaphors does not obscure closure, and no loops or scaffolds harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a saxophonist using silence to hush a prophecy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight with specific, grounded choices.</comment>
