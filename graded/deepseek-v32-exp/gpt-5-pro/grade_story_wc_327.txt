<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority ("promise had settled in me like a quiet bruise"). The final choice to give up personal names is earned by prior causality, showing a meaningful change with visible cost. Minor lack of on-page internal conflict, but micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost ("I gave it the left and right of my own"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the tunnel of echoes braids voice back, doubling and halving to emerge as soft current, with persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV ("towers of bone," "canyon of endless echoes"). The environment constrains choices and charges the final image, as the bone towers and canyon directly pressure the protagonist's actions and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating texture into sound) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in surrendering names. The diamond's curse flexing like a hand closing and the flock's verbs deepen pressure, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the diamond eating private names to hold public ones safe, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to language preservation. Subtext operates in implication without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("reading the air above the rim") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistently poetic and articulate, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping, elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no artifacts affecting closure. Read-aloud rhythm supports momentum, and line-level craft is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific details like copper veins and texture translation, with risk-taking in lyric style. The combination feels organic and inevitable, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
