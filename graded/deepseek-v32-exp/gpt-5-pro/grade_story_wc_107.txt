<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to craft safe zones is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like counting breaths. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the shift from past brashness to current patience is earned. However, some introspection edges toward abstraction without full dramatization, slightly limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where inquiry feels like home, cost legible in the patient transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure builds through patterned reflections without causality breaks. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices, such as the thaw influencing glassblowing timing, and charges the final image with puddles mirroring the sky. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The environment functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating safe zones escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in narrating tasks and counting breaths. Cost is visible in the effort and transformation, foreclosing past haste. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell cools, reweighting options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thawing and inquiry emerges organically from images and actions, with subtext in gestures like the bookmark anchoring teachers.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, reflective prose. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language serving atmosphere without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats, such as "weighty lightness that is almost music," slightly reduces clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glassblowing in an abandoned control room feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes.
