<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. His method of paraphrasing to dissolve boundaries is a credible, earned choice that forecloses paths with visible cost, aligning with his aesthetic drive and patience. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the final stance crystallizes through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost as the ice "reconsiders" and boundaries dissolve, legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern shifts intensifying through density and cadence. Orientation is clear early (poet, atrium, post-ban), and the lens coheres without ambiguity, shaping tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are integral, constraining choices and charging the closure as the ice transforms under the poet's touch. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "cold ink," "angles and pale teeth"), filtered through POV to mirror internal states. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the setting evolving causally to support the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming boundaries escalates through the poet's agency in paraphrasing, tightening options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page as the quartz "loosens" and the ice dissolves, forcing a trade-off that reweights options. Pressure coheres from initial desire to final reconfiguration, driven by protagonist choice without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving boundaries through listening emerges implicitly from events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the colonnade's hum. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the ice's transformation and the wall reminder, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical, rhythmically controlled prose that modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "lantern-moth hush") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within the poet's lexicon, and elision supports clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic variety, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors like "salt releases the color" are coherent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion, and closure image is undulled by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tropes (e.g., poet-hero, ban lifting) through specific, grounded choices in character and method. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test: the arc depends on the exact elements of paraphrasing and listening.</comment>
