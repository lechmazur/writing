<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., using superstitions to overcome hesitation). The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the release of breath and scars warming like harbors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (breath release, scars reconfigured). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory details. Orientation is clear early, and the held breath constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (floating rock platform) pressures choices via the crystallizing tea and held breath, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the crow quill and scars recurring to constrain action and deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the held breath and crystallization forcing higher-stakes choices. Cost is legible in the emotional and physical tension during the inscription, culminating in a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming scars into stories emerges through particulars (e.g., superstitions, tea crystallization) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the scars becoming "tiny harbors," reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (poetic, sensory-rich voice). Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and elision (e.g., held breath) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "stormlight brushed everything"), but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rune scholarship, tea ceremony, and floating setting feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation of scars is specific and memorable.</comment>
