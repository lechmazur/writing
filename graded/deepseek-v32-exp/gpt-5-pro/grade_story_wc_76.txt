<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "bleak exhilaration, a dare that tasted like iron"); final choice to maintain reversed clocks is earned with visible cost (feeding regrets, tightened screws). Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible on-page ("If I failed, the lens would howl outward"); causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from yoyo reverse-engineering to time reversal; orientation is clear early, and structure coheres in a single scene with shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful ("slick weed," "spidered glass"), with the lighthouse, hunger stone, and yoyo constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrating into action (e.g., "I traced it with a finger, and felt dry thunder moving").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens (reverse-engineering, initiating reversal); cost is unmistakable in the maintenance trade-offs ("Every night I fed it a year from my hoard of regrets"); dominant stake (step beyond fate) tightens meaningfully through the rendezvous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (fate vs. agency, memory) emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfigured purpose ("Not rescue, but rendezvous"); subtext operates in implication without moralizing, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control ("Back teeth of brass bit forward"); voice is consistent and poetic, modulating with pressure; elision (e.g., sister's voice) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and propulsion with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("gulls become sketches, waves become equations"); sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of elements (counter clockwise clocks, yoyo as key, latent radiance); tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices, and risk-taking (reversed time mechanics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
