<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies almost entirely on diagnostic labels ("somatic marker," "drone strike wedding survivor") and summary rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal state is delivered via therapy-speak explanations ("observe these bodily signals without judgment"), creating a clinical distance that prevents genuine emotional engagement. There is no contradictory impulse or struggle in the scene; she acts exactly as the "resilient survivor" archetype dictates without deviation or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where a trigger occurs and is immediately resolved by the protagonist's pre-existing competence ("she had the tools"). The resolution feels like a "soft reset" because the crisis (the aircraft hum) is managed through internal monologue and summary rather than a difficult choice or action with consequences. The ending is a return to status quo (grafting) without a palpable shift in the story's charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The setting is functional but depicted through somewhat generic, postcard-like descriptions ("wind whispered," "salt-scorched earth"). While the arboretum and lighthouse serve as adequate metaphors for the theme ("endurance mirrored her own slow healing"), they lack the specific, tactile details that would make the environment feel lived-in or constraining to the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is internal but largely theoretical; the struggle is described ("familiar dread rising") and then solved via exposition ("Elara had learned to observe..."). There is no escalation of pressure; the "freeze" response is mentioned but effectively bypassed by her "pearl of stillness," resulting in zero on-page cost. The stakes remain abstract because the outcome (successful coping) is never in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and thesis statements ("Her motivation was simple yet profound: to anchor optimism in realism") rather than emerging from the narrative. The final paragraph relies on heavy-handed summary ("not a denial of reality, but a choice") to explain the meaning to the reader, which flattens resonance and violates the "show, don't tell" principle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The voice suffers from a jarring mix of flowery literary prose and clinical terminology ("somatic marker," "integrate it," "somatic awareness"). This "therapy-speak" creates a didactic tone that feels more like a wellness vignette than a literary story. The lack of a distinct, grounded perceptual signature makes the narration feel generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense with abstract nouns and repetitive labeling ("pearl of stillness" and "somatic" both appear three times in a short text). There is a pervasive reliance on telling over showing ("She was quietly talented," "quiet triumph"), and the sentence structure often loops into explanatory clauses that kill momentum. The phrasing "The action of freeze often followed" is particularly awkward and mechanical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story integrates the prompt elements in a formulaic checklist manner without transforming them into a fresh narrative. The combination of "drone strike survivor" and "gardening for healing" is a familiar trope handled here with standard, expected beats. The reliance on jargon to bridge the elements ("somatic marker") highlights the artificiality of the construction.</comment>
