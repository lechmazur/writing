<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's scientifically romantic motivation drives the experiment, with interiority shown through concrete actions like the pocket-sun flickering. The relationship crucible forces micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance (calibration over kissing) with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, building through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration where the shared proof of presence revalues the moment. Closure lands with cost in the altered connection, and orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ember nexus and nautilus shell curl act as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like "cinders drift like migrating seeds" are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing presence escalates through protagonist agency in the experiment, with cost legible in the calibration. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully to foreclose options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of presence and connection emerges through particulars like the curl and proof, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the shared instrument, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is strong in phrases like "whisper tastes of juniper and doubt," and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves clarity, e.g., "pocket sun brightens as though flattered into accuracy," propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a pocket-sun alchemist capturing presence is a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
