<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority (e.g., heartbeat counting) and micro-choices (using the shard) that reveal flawed self-perception. The final choice to treat the shard as a lens rather than a wound is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfiguration. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as arguing with the ghost while seeking wisdom, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the protagonist reconfigures the shard's meaning and seeks "a wiser kind of dark," reweighting prior failure. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through motifs like the ghost and ink patterns. Orientation is clear within 120 words (observatory, snow, radio static), and cost is legible in the final image of carrying the shard as a lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (opal observatory under snow) and micro-settings (porcelain shard, spilled ink) constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory details (e.g., "snow settling like fine ash") filtered through POV. The shard's refraction in light and ink patterns directly shape the protagonist's recalibration and closure, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from engaging the digital ghost to recalibrating receivers, narrowing options toward wisdom. Cost is unmistakable in the realization that self-blinding faith caused the failure, with stakes deepening through the ink patterns and ghost's dialogue. One meaningful tightening occurs as the past "stops arguing" during recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom from failure emerges through particulars like the shard and ink patterns, with subtext in the ghost's critique ("you merely believed yourself big enough"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of the shard as a lens, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, introspective, with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "heartbeats: twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three"). Purposeful elision (e.g., radio static clears) is taught and paid off, and dialogue with the ghost carries subtext and advances stakes. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere (e.g., "The ink trembles as if struck by an unseen bell"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, though minor overwriting risks exist without harming closure. Clarity and propulsion are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital ghost, ink divination, and observatory setting feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail (e.g., porcelain shard's evolution), and the closure reconfigures meaning with bold specificity. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision is clear.</comment>
