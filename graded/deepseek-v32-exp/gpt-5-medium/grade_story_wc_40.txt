<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (e.g., hand nicked by paper) and micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete, and the final choice to testify is earned by prior causality with visible cost, showing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Charged Poise (preparing to testify) that reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern is taught and paid off, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., dust as constellations) that constrain choices and charge the final image. The library and crystal function as micro-setting that alters tactics and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding growth) escalates through scholar's agency with the crystal, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in the testimony preparation, and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., growth as refusal), with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates in silence and implication, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, though slightly dense in peaks, but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar concepts (language growth) with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
