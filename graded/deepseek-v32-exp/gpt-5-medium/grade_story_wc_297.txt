<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "roots in my ankles and questions in my ribs," and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing skin to bark, reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to offer a new vow is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the cambium recording. However, slight abstractness in phrases like "anxious elation" slightly diminishes peak beat specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the blurred border reweights the premise, cost legible in the "agreement recorded in cambium." Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear early with "cobalt glade at dusk." No causality breaks; persistent constraint of the eclipsed covenant shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, such as the maze topiary altering tactics, and charges the final image with the "mirrored pool rose like a plate." Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like "leaf-veins lit with residual lightning," filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is coherent in the maze navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with density increase in the scar-linking and maze unfolding narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the new vow's "braided" promise, foreclosing the old covenant. Dominant stake of finding dream intersection tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, not statement, with the final blurred border offering a resonant, non-literal answer to covenants and dreams. Subtext operates in gestures like pressing scars, and complexity avoids tidy morals. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the maze seed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "root-bound visionary," and rhythmic control under pressure, as in "jittering but firm." Purposeful elision in time is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "a living diagram of maybe." Read-aloud ear test passes with natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of concepts like eclipsed covenants and scar-linking, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, as in the maze topiary's evolving use.</comment>
