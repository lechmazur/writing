<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "porcelain cracks in her eyes." The final choice to bring the chair and scatter ash is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mother's reaction. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as working without permission but seeking blessing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the chair slows and mother squeezes the wrist, reconfiguring stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the chair shapes tactics. Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost, and the lens remains coherent without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "house exhales dust" and "smell like singed sugar" filtered through POV. The rocking chair and gallery function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative, supporting the theme without ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth and permission escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency in scattering ash and bringing the chair. Cost is legible in the mother's silent approval and the chair's rocking. One meaningful tightening occurs as the exhibition unfolds, foreclosing options with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of safety as a mirage emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the chair's slowing and mother's words, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "a storm of names dissolving into faces." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of art and family trauma, with the ash scatterer concept feeling organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
