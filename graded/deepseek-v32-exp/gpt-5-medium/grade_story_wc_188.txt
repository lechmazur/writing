<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices revealing values under stress. The relationship with Lark acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter the story's course. The final action is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the fireworks display reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("gravity loosen"). Causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic note constrains tactics, shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the fortress and mosaic constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully integrated into action, such as the wind funneling for fireworks. The environment pressures tactics and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency, driven by causal linkages. Cost is legible in the effort and outcome, with fireworks altering the atmosphere. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of serious playfulness emerges organically from events and images, not statement. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; complexity lingers through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "filtered the burned smell from memory") slightly muddles clarity, but no major artifacts or loops harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elements (fireworks designer, mosaic note) feels inevitable and non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details anchor originality, transforming familiar ideas.</comment>
