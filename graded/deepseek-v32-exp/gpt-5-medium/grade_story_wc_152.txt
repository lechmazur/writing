<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pricking finger to dab thread) revealing values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though agency is slightly passive in listening. Final choice to carry rumor and seek sleep is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as embroiderer carries rumor and candle watches, with cost legible in blame warning and stained cloth. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, oriented early, and causality flows from stitching to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "domes sighed," "dust made constellations") filtered through POV. Observatory and embroidery cloth constrain choices and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency in stitching and unraveling, leading to conspiracy revelation with cost (blame warning). Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth in foolishness emerges through specifics like jester hat stitching and whispered conspiracies, with subtext in gestures (keeper's quivering wrist). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control (e.g., "rumor is a wandering star"). Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and figurative language that avoids muddle (e.g., "truth hover like a moth"). No loops or scaffold; clarity maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise of galaxy-chart embroiderer is fresh and non-obvious, transforming tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
