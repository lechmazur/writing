<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like dowsing that reveal hierarchy of values. The final acceptance of grief is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "sorrow unfolds its chart without vanishing." No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in the stillpoint's axis consent. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, driven by sensory density and pattern shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory detail filtered through POV (e.g., "bark syllables seep into palms"). Setting guides tactics via the compass ring and musical notes, integrating environment into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density increases in sensory and emotional layers, with agency in dowsing and following notes narrowing options. Cost is felt in the acceptance of grief, though pressure is more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of embracing grief emerges through particulars like the stillpoint and compass ring, with subtext in actions and a non-literal, resonant answer at closure. No moralizing; earned wisdom arises from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in phrases like "absorb languages through skin." Voice remains coherent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., sensory translation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, e.g., "quiet blaze brighten, patient fire meeting patient stone," and propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Transformation of grief tropes through specific detail and coherence in vision.</comment>
