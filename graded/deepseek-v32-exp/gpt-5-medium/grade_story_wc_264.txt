<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive to "cultivate sparks" is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete through actions like humming and interacting with the archive, with micro-choices revealing values. Final transformation is earned by prior causality, though some emotions lean abstract without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the archive folds and spores spread, reweighting meaning with cost legible in the "greenhouse moving north" image. Orientation is clear early, and pattern taught pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the glowing dunes and archive car constraining choices—e.g., dunes singing triggers archive interaction. Environment charges the final image, and sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating sparks escalates through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with humming and clock-flipping tightening pressure. Cost is visible in the archive's transformation and spore dispersal, foreclosing prior chaos with felt trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and memory emerges organically through images like the chess clock and spores, with subtext in implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the "greenhouse" closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates purposefully, and any elision (e.g., "wave functions") is taught and pays off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language enhancing clarity without muddle in peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentences advance story and atmosphere with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-apocalyptic and poetic elements with freshness, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
