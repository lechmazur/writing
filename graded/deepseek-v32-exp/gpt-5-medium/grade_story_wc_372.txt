<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the vow to "anchor even the vanishing." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of oblivion shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices through the frozen library's hush and the magic lantern's mechanics, charging the final image with the "exhaled" breath. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's actions, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from measuring vows to the library's demand for a final entry. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation into keeper, with stakes tightening through the mentor's fractured pledge. Agency and cost align with the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, blending meticulous observation with poetic rhythm.
