<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The map framer's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like comparing videos and tracing seams. The final choice to frame the map with the tear visible is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with felt cost. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot escalates through pattern recognition of silence and damp, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration with the chapel's discovery. Closure lands on-page with cost in the community's response, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The seam as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with the rain-scoured fresco vault and henge constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "cold air nick my fingertips" are purposeful and integrated into action, supporting the theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering silence escalates under the Accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in investigating videos and tracing the seam. Cost is legible in the village's careful movement and the map's framing, foreclosing options with visible trade-offs. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as architecture emerges through particulars like the torn map and pricked prayers, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as the verger's shrug, inviting reflection through earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent through turns, and any elision (e.g., silent videos) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "rain eats old limestone" is coherent and purposeful, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, clarity untouched in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of map framing, whispered chapel, and silence is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed to with transformative detail.</comment>
