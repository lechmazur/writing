<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to navigate loss is consistently embodied through micro-choices like setting out with the censer foot, and the final endurance is earned with visible cost in the ache remapped. Interiority avoids stock phrasing, with concrete sensations like "her voice rise through my ribs" under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "every step remaps the ache," under an Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. The mosaic structure with time shifts is taught early and pays off in the final image of following the tide of absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the station's pulse fluctuates with moon phases, and the censer foot pivots the needle—with sensory specificity like "salt pans that mirror every star" filtered through the narrator's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the narrator's agency under the Accumulative lens, from building the compass to tracing the beacon inland, with cost legible in the "rough mercy" of the sand and the foreclosed option of return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reverse migration emerges through particulars like the censer foot and Mara's notes, offering a resonant non-literal answer in "not return but recognition" without moralizing, charged by the final image of the path etched like a seam.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, compressed diction ("exhales steam like a wounded animal"), and rhythmic control under pressure, such as the cadence shift in "Reverse migration is never over."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "a single bone finger" is purposeful and coherent, with clear propulsion through peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of reverse migration with memory, transformed through specific details like the drowned chapel censer foot, and risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
