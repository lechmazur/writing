<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with clear motives and internal conflict; the curator's bewildered nature and resolute change are earned through specific micro-choices, such as using the cameo and eating the fruit, with visible cost in his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under the Causal lens, from inciting incident to closure; the Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with cost in the burning cameo and altered understanding, and orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices through orchard rules and pod retreats; sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the grove closing like covers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from pursuing forbidden knowledge to eating the fruit; cost is legible in the rewriting of his mind and the cameo's burn, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges through events and images without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material, as seen in the curator's new role to "curate the between."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent in single POV, with lyrical prose and perceptual signature; no head-hopping, and purposeful compression, such as "brightened disquiet," enhances rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the fruit-eating scene, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of astral orchard and nonlinear inheritance; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in structure and imagery that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
