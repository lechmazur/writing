<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like counting breaths and placing the fossil revealing hierarchy of values. Final choice to leave the fossil as a contract is earned by prior causality with visible cost, foreclosing ownership in favor of partnership.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early with who, where, when anchored. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the cave stabilizes with amber trust, costing the fossil's relinquishment; cost is legible in the final image of warmth persisting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., slipping through mineral hair, wedging in tunnel). The cave network and fossil recur to charge the final image; details are filtered through POV bias, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of voicing the unknown escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases (storm, heat-map flares). Protagonist agency drives turns like placing the fossil and enduring the surge; cost is unmistakable in the fossil's relinquishment and persistent warmth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and partnership emerges organically from events and images, not statement; subtext operates in the fossil as contract. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "the unknown hums under my words," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating under pressure (e.g., "heat-mapping emotions"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "thermal grammar"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sensory mapping, hibernation, and cave communication in a fresh, non-obvious way; specific details like the elm leaf fossil and heat-mapping feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
