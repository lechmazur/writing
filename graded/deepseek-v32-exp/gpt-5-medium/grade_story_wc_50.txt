<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as cupping the timer and listening to its wrongness, but lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural lens with clear orientation and closure where he leaves the timer, but causality is loose, and the cost, while felt, isn't as sharp as required for higher scores.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, like mapping reflection angles, and charges the final image with the cavern keeping an echo, but capped due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of harvesting echoes is fresh and well-integrated, with risk-taking in poetic style, but capped due to Q2 not meeting the 9.0 gate.</comment>
