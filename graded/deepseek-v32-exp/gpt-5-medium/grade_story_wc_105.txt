<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in past betrayal; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "I lay beneath the aurora and counted the beats between colors"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, and final renunciation is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens held; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image ("each copy gentler"). Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of shards coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., orchard calibration, shipwrecks chiming). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in emotional weight (e.g., testing the bowl on the diver). One meaningful tightening forecloses options, though pressure is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("what you save decides what the shattering can no longer erase"). Subtext operates in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptual signature (e.g., "Blue is a far drum, green a plucked wire"). Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting risk in peak beats does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a specific, non-obvious synthesis (hearing aid designer in surreal setting). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
