<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with consistent traits driving micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of visibility is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his continued unseen state. Motivation intensifies through the vow and actions, compelling higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the dweller's withdrawal and chalk markings. Accumulative/textural lens holds, with causality driven by the tape's sense memory and outage. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the library and outage constraining choices and charging the final image. Details like "sapphire hush" and "pipe chases" are integrated into action, reflecting POV bias and escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using the tape to narrow options and deepen stakes. Cost is visible in his unseen service and the girl's relief, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility and service emerges through particulars like the tape and cache, offering a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gestures and imagery, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent, and any elision (e.g., sense memory) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with purposeful figurative language and no loops or artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere seamlessly, and closure is clear without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements (crawl space dweller, sense memory tape) with organic specificity, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
