<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; her "awkwardly confident" trait constrains actions, and the final choice to share the route is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the risk of waking silencers; orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful tightening when she activates the stone circle; cost is unmistakable on the page in the risk and the projected map altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to finding meaning; no moralizing, and subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice has a distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control; purposeful elision (e.g., the stone circle's mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports pressure without obscuring clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure effect remains legible.</comment>
