<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and desire for open silence are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., limiting exposure to gilded hush). Final choice to share silence with father is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of isolation with visible cost in their collaborative redrawing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (father's change and collaboration). Cost is legible when he says the silence "tastes safe, but not like a door locking." Orientation is clear early, and the trellis pattern teaches the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (trellis, bunkers) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen." Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through the protagonist's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist's agency in collecting and sharing silences, with cost felt in the transformation of the father's approach. Dominant stake (safety vs. freedom) tightens through the climb and sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as home emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the doll's use. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the father's realization and their collaboration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pulse burr like a trapped moth"). Voice is poetic and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "honey strained through linen." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes claustrophobia, gravity inversion, and silence collection with freshness and specificity. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
