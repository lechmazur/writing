<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The final renunciation of exile as vocation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in "exile tilt into vocation." Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (twilight garden) and object (moonstone) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through the tattooing act. Cost is unmistakable in the foreclosed path of exile, reweighted with purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and art emerges naturally from events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. Subtext operates in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Elision is taught and paid off, and voice remains coherent under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no artifacts or loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, enhancing clarity and momentum in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of dystopian and lyrical elements, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
