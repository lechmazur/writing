<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's dry wit and subtle confidence are embodied through micro-choices under pressure, such as trusting the condensation pattern and turning the valve. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions filtered through professional detachment and winter-hardened endurance. The final choice to record the convergence feels earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the protagonist accepts the rivers' departure, with cost legible in "water that begins as one must learn to part again." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and pattern recognition. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the phrasebook's instructions pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the frozen lake and condensation pattern guiding the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, such as "ice made a sound like a door considering whether to close." The outpost's creaking girders and the culvert's valves act as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from following condensation patterns to turning the valve, with cost felt in the "relief" of convergence. Stakes are signaled early and tighten through the falcon's reports and the phrasebook's verbs. A minor weakness is the passive observation in some beats, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of convergence and listening emerges through particulars like the condensation pattern and valve-turning, offering a non-literal answer to naming vs. wildness. Subtext operates in images such as "the glass taught me a patient geography" and the falcon as clerk. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending atlas editor precision with poetic observation. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "snow whispered over iron." No head-hopping; elision (like the phrasebook's languages) is taught and pays off. Diction remains within the character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "veins met veins." No loops or scaffold; minor overwriting in peaks, but clarity is maintained. Closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of exploration and lyrical pattern-seeking, with the condensation method feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
