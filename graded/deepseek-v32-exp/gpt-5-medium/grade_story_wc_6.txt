<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied actions like using the coin and sand. Contradictory impulses between her father's legacy and her compassion are dramatized in scene, and the final choice to teach the boy is earned with visible cost in her reflection. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, such as sprinkling sand instead of accusing the water.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the final image of her becoming "the opposite of a fuse." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the coin and sand shapes tactics. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and the ending reweights options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the obsidian lagoon constraining choices and charging the final image through the ritual. Sensory details like "wind smelled of salt and cooled lava" are filtered through POV, and spatial choreography is coherent. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, elevating stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving scars can sing escalates under accumulative lens through density increases in rituals and interaction with the boy. Protagonist agency drives tightening, as her decision to teach forecloses isolation with cost legible in the "engine of unyielding compassion." Coincidence does not resolve; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the coin, sand, and grafting action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and images, such as the boy smiling "as if forgiven by the wind." Emotional aftereffect is concrete through scene work, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext in the boy's interaction. Purposeful compression, like "a graceful delay," is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolds; figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in peaks, like "chorus of tiny breakages," but clarity remains, and closure image is undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of arsonist's daughter firefighter with healing themes feels inevitable, transformed through specific details like the coin and grafting. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids templates, and the premise commits fully to implications.</comment>
