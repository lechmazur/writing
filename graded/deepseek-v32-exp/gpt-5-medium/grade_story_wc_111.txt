<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of mere spectacle for steadfast work is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the acceptance of both bloom and wither.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong, building through patterned rituals to a resonant reconfiguration where gardener and garden achieve mutual recognition. Closure lands with felt cost in the steady dials and exchanged nods, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details (e.g., hedges hissing, dials ticking) woven into action and perception to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as the maze's objection forces a confession that deepens stakes. Cost is legible in the reconciliation and the vine's decision, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of mutual recognition between caretaker and cultivated emerges through particulars like the marbles and fountain, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, reflective, and rhythmically controlled. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively, even in peak beats like the fountain confession.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of measurable luck and sentient garden is freshly synthesized with specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
