<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deep, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; the final reconfiguration of the vial as a compass is earned through prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; closure lands with on-page cost (tears collected, vial reconfigured) and persistent constraint (smells/memories) shapes tactics; orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "crystal shadows" and the greenhouse constraining choices; the environment charges the final image by enabling the flower's transformation and the protagonist's insight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates through protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the tear collection and emotional release, driving one meaningful deepening that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and grief emerges through events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the vial as a compass, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and any elision (e.g., ultraviolet revealing) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing elements like the lantern broker and extinct plants; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
