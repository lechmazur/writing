<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistent, with interiority shown through embodied actions like sign language and sketching. The whispering advisor adds relational pressure, and Arin's final understanding earns the closure with visible cost. Minor abstraction in emotional expression prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Arin tunes memory through mapping silence, reweighting prior material with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harbor setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "moon run shivers" and "barnacle glitter" woven into action. It functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics, such as when the tide responds to Arin's map, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increases in mapping silence, driven by Arin's agency in actions like ringing the bell. Cost is legible in the "joyful sorrow" acceptance, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract, limiting a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the camera capturing "nothing" and the advisor's whispers, offering a non-literal answer to silence and memory. Subtext in gestures and the final reconfiguration avoids moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, using poetic syntax and rhythm that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision in silence mapping is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "sound traveled outward like a ring through milk" is coherent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of translating silence through mapping is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Specific details like the filmless camera and sign language avoid template plots, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
