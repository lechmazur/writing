<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and adaptive; Ada's grief is embodied through the locket and tapping, with micro-choices like matching the song rhythm earning her emotional shift. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; the final relief feels costly and character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ada's tracing of the locket question reweights wonder and loss with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the eclipse progression tightens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (sage, stone, silvering air) are selective and purposeful; the courtyard and tree roots constrain choices (moving beneath them) and charge the final image of shared instrument. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes of emotional connection escalate under accumulative lens through music and eclipse totality; protagonist's agency in holding the locket deepens cost. One meaningful tightening forecloses isolation with visible relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges through particulars (sock-whistling, bullfinch) and Ada's question mark curl; subtext in gesture and silence avoids moralizing. Ending reweights wonder as love without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("ravens wrote cursive"); lyrical prose modulates with eclipse tempo. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural in story-sharing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high density without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("tiny iron moon of loss") is coherent and peaks in closure. Sentences advance character and atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and cosmic event through specific details (locket, kalimba); transformation of eclipse trope via emotional specificity. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
