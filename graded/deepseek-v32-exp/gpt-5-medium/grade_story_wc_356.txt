<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The shift from ambition to stewardship is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the village's initial flinching and subsequent equilibrium.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the village steadies and the protagonist's ambition softens, with cost legible in the "flinched as if truths had teeth" moment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early and persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the treetop village and bridge constraining choices, and the corpse flower's smell charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the seed's bloom causing a meaningful tightening that reweights the stake of serenity. Cost is unmistakable in the village's flinching and subsequent breathing together.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in grandmother's note and doodles. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bloom and steadiness, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with a strong olfactory perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, with a non-obvious synthesis of elements like the treetop village and corpse flower. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
