<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal values, such as welcoming Brin's hunger. The final choice to scatter seeds is earned by prior causality, though internal contradiction is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as the portico opens and seeds scatter, reconfiguring the town's allegiance under a causal lens. Cost is legible in the town's gasp and the prophet's pattern, with orientation anchored early and persistent constraints from the storm and radio.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the storm influencing actions and the cobalt glass portico charging the final image when it opens. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated, with no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from lonely work to collaboration with Brin and town involvement, with visible cost in the baptism and scattering seeds. Stakes tighten meaningfully, though some abstractions remain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as variant allegiance and weatherwork, with a resonant non-literal answer in the final kite spine image. Subtext operates through radio messages and Brin's arrival, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping, though some overwriting may slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language that generally coheres and advances the story. No major loops or scaffolds, though a few metaphors like "gossiping bones" are slightly strained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of weatherwork and prophetic elements, transformed through specific choices like the radio messages and Brin's collaboration. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
