<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion; micro-choices like tracking sun trails and tilting the wing reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The donor heart's memory and the final understanding of magnetism as posture show earned change with cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; closure is a conceptual repricing where the realization that "magnetism was not greed but posture" reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of light and stories builds coherently to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly pressures choices, such as moving stools to catch sun trails, and the blue morpho wing charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the dye master's POV, with the tea house and cliffs shaping action and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning story magnetism escalates through protagonist agency in experimenting with light and the wing, narrowing options and leading to protective actions. Cost is legible in the widow's borrowed tales and the protagonist's realization, under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of storytelling and restraint emerges through events and images like the morpho wing and sun trails, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the heart aligning, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision and compression are taught and paid off, as in the light and wing imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as "stories cling to me as if my apron were magnetized iron," advancing character and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of donor heart, dye master, and morpho wing feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like the wing's iridescent caution transform familiar concepts.</comment>
