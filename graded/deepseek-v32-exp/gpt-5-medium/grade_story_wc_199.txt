<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving earned change; the final realization that "the hearer" is transformed is rooted in prior causality and visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the protagonist's new understanding, and the structure coheres with taught patterns from the outset, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., monuments humming to guide leaves) and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, exceeding the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density driven by protagonist agency; the cost is unmistakable in the transformation of the hearer, aligning with the lens and 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the protagonist's insight; no moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; elision is taught and paid off in closure, and voice remains coherent under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material uniquely.</comment>
