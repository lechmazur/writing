<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to find where stories begin is clear and consistent, driving key choices like incising the map and offering the ledger. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "the apple trembled as though listening for an edit." Final choice to receive the seed is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the effort of quantification. No contradictory impulses, but emotional depth and micro-choices under pressure are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing: the comma-seed reweights beginnings with cost in attention and effort. Inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with density increase in imagery and patterns. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through the journey to the vault. Cost is legible in the on-page offering of regrets and the plinth's sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the glass orchard and sea of clouds pressure the map incising and method of entry. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "clouds churned softly below." The environment charges the final image with the seed, and micro-setting elements like the bottled moonlight alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding where stories begin escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in the quantification process. Protagonist agency drives escalation via actions like pouring moonlight and offering regrets. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the ledger and the effort spent. One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings and forgiveness emerges implicitly through events and images, e.g., the seed as a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like the acceptance of the ledger. Ending offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars like the "comma-seed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature: poetic, rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulations with emotional intensity, e.g., "the air swung open." Purposeful elision like "quantifying absence" is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "like a bird judging weather." No artifacts or muddle in peak beats; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative drive. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific: clean slate vendor in a magical library synthesizes familiar ideas with originality. Tropes transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
