<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mailman's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., staying to witness the storm) revealing a hierarchy of values. His motivation intensifies credibly, and the final choice to deliver the letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the boy's changed posture. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his rebellious fostering amid regulations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost, reconfiguring the protagonist's understanding of his role through the storm's revelation and the letter delivery. The accumulative/textural lens holds, linking absences to charge the final image. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective (e.g., "cobalt arcade," "water tastes faintly of pennies"), filtered through the mailman's POV. The thunderstorm jar and arcade constrain choices and charge the final image, with environment shaping tactics like navigating by absences. Specificity supports atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes deepening through the interaction with Mina and the storm's revelation. Cost is legible in the mailman's decision to stay and deliver the letter, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as linking absences and healing promises, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the boy's receipt of the letter, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Mina's thumbprint and the storm's cataloging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet grounded, with diction consistent to the mailman's worldview. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, and elision (e.g., absences) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though minor density in high-pressure beats (e.g., storm description) slightly risks clarity. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies naturally with sentence-level propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of the mailman role in disputed territory, the thunderstorm jar, and the method of linking absences. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
