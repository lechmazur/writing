<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; micro-choices like cracking pods and listening to birds reveal values under pressure, and his renunciation of past violence for renewal is earned with visible cost, though internal conflict is subtle rather than contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens; the final image of the jetty blooming and battlefield unlacing under green reweights prior material with felt cost; orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the jetty's salt-slick boards guiding the cart and the battlefield's shell holes influencing seed placement; the environment charges the final image with sensory detail that mirrors internal renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of reclaiming the battlefield escalate through the coachman's persistent fertilizing; agency drives deepening under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformation of rusting cannon wheels into a lattice for morning glory, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of submerged concord and renewal emerges through images and actions without direct statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer with the garden quieting ghosts, resisting tidy morals and arising from concrete particulars like the pact between brine memory and seed breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the recitation of dead languages, enhances clarity without head-hopping; purposeful elision in lyric mode is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language like "seeds rustle like crows' feet on vellum" is purposeful and clear, maintaining momentum in peak beats; no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; specific details like dead languages and bird calls create a fresh, non-obvious angle on renewal after conflict, with risk-taking in lyrical heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
