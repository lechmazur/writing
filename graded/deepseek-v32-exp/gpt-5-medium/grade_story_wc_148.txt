<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure image. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as chasing hush while acknowledging inherited false alarms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is established early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The lighthouse constraint shapes tactics and the final image, making the closure legible and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details filtered through POV. The lighthouse prison constrains choices and charges the final image, while micro-settings like the lattice and drain alter tactics. Atmosphere supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening in the chase for hush. Cost is legible in the final act of setting the lattice and steering the current. Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the lattice and lighthouse, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of inheritance and truth. Subtext operates through implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of the cry wolf metaphor with a lighthouse prison, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details anchor universals.</comment>
