<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in sensory specificity; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "the weight arrived as a smell"). The final acceptance of truth is earned through prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; closure choice forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the acceptance of truth. Orientation is clear early, and mosaic structure with parallel universes is taught by ~25% with legible transitions. The ending reweights options without exposition, and the persistent constraint of the shard shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (ozone, rain, chains), selectively detailed and purposefully integrated into action. The repair bay and green glass shard constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details reflect POV bias, avoiding generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering truth) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase in parallel universes exploration, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the acceptance scene. One meaningful tightening forecloses options, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and acceptance emerges through events and images, not direct statement; subtext operates in mother's silence and the shard's refraction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory map maker's focus). Voice is consistent and rhythmic under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; diction remains within POV's lexicon, and prose reflects the mind state effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes with clarity and momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universes, transformed via specific details and character-driven stakes. Risk-taking in mosaic structure heightens meaning without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
