<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to discover the color of sound is concrete and drives the narrative; micro-choices like diving and making a vow reveal a hierarchy of values. The final vow to "light the pier without tiring of attention" is an earned endurance with visible cost, foreclosing a path. Interiority is embodied in lines like "hides behind truth," avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist's vow and realization about sound's color charge the ending with cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands on-page with the silver hum and vow, making cost legible in "earn it, not borrow it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice: the sunken library "yawned, muttering like wet timbered bells," and books with "lettering woke in a glow" directly enable the discovery. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, with the key tag and library charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering sound's color escalates under accumulative lens through density increases, driven by protagonist's agency in diving, reading vows, and making a vow. Cost is legible in the requirement to "earn" the silver, narrowing options with a trade-off between borrowing and earning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the luminous vows and color discovery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to patience and attention without moralizing. The final image of lanterns as "notes I had heard" reweights prior material through implication, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, reflective voice ("lanterns lifted like careful planets"). Diction and syntax are consistently character-specific, and elision (e.g., "practiced leaving") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though minor overwriting risk exists in peak beats like "color like breath seen on glass," but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of discovering sound's color is fresh and non-obvious, synthesized with specific elements like the sunken library and vows. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the ending feels inevitable through grounded particulars.</comment>
