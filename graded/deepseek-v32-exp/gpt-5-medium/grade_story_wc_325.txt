<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's claustrophobia and compulsion are embodied through concrete micro-choices like counting drips and measuring air seams, with contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final decision to leave the gold fleck is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost when she relinquishes her luck token. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing undermines the interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the machine reveals her own note and she leaves the fleck, with cost legible in "the machine had enough of me." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, intensifying through sensory density. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the phase-transition mechanics pay off at the door and terminal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices at key beats, such as the tidal timeframe forcing entry tactics and the facility's corroded door requiring phase-transition unlocking. The gold fleck as a micro-setting object charges the final image when left on the contact pad. Sensory details like "brine freezing where heat skipped" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, from navigating the cave squeeze to activating the terminal, with cost unmistakable when she forfeits the gold fleck. The dominant stake of standing by the unremembered tightens through the machine's list, forcing a trade-off that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through particulars like the gold fleck's journey and the machine's message, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to being noticed. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, as leaving the fleck conceptualizes redemption and memory. Subtext operates in gestures like laughing that "steadied my hands."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature, with rhythmic control under pressure in lines like "ice bridged the broken gap." Purposeful elision of past events is taught early and pays off in the machine's reveal. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific through peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold, as in "the door unlipped with a tired sigh." Figurative language is consistent and legible, avoiding muddle in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, supporting momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic spelunker, undersea cables, and sacramental gold fleck feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in poetic style heightening stakes. Specific lived detail transforms tropes, as the facility's history and phase transitions deepen the moral calculus. Closure reconfigures meaning through a non-obvious, earned insight.</comment>
