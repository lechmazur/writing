Her motivation intensifies through the story, compelling higher-stakes choices like conceiving revival and leading the community, with a credible endurance foreclosing the path of wishes at a visible cost. The sailor applies secondary pressure, enhancing the crucible of relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing with the amber bottle's ticking, reweighting the premise from wishes to labor with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages, such as Iria's actions leading to the sailor's arrival and community gathering. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory details like salt, ash, and kelp ink, filtered through Iria's POV to guide choices. The paper-lantern cove and abandoned quay pressure tactics, while recurring objects like the amber bottle constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with details integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revival without wishes is signaled early and escalates through Iria's agency, such as writing the charter and coordinating with the sailor. A meaningful tightening occurs when the community gathers, foreclosing the option of wishes with visible cost in labor and trust. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, driven by protagonist decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the charter and bell, offering a resonant non-literal answer to revival through labor and community.

Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggles, avoiding abstraction and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice and perceptual signature, reflected in rhythmic prose and selective attention.

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of post-magical revival tropes through specific grounded choices in character and world, such as the amber bottle and working memory.
