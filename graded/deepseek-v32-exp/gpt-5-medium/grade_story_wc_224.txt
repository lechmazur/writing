<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in pain; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "ache of a key searching for a door"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final renunciation of shame is earned, though some backstory is summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive conceptual repricing: home as practice, not dwelling, with felt cost of buried talents. Accumulative/textural lens holds, orientation is clear early, and the seer's nightly substitution tightens options without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (labyrinthine aisles, shifting shelves). Sensory details (e.g., "books smelled like old rivers and flint") are POV-filtered, and the mountain exhaling charges the final image of the courtyard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home and buried talents) escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (touching stone, deciding to seed). Cost is legible in shame and silenced mouth, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., stone humming, house of vowels). Subtext in gestures (feather on tongue) avoids moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer to home's shape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent; dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax, advancing story without scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peaks (e.g., "letters swam like minnows") but coherent and legible, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bookstore, mountain, and seer feels inevitable; tropes transformed through specific details (e.g., mercury-glass eyes). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
