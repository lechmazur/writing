<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; final choice to continue noticer role is earned with visible cost in tenuous absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) and felt cost in "lighter but not exonerated."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., thorn and nettle test patience) and charges the final image with seeds planted; sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (finding absolution) escalates through narrator's agency in gardening, uncloaking, and sharing; cost is legible in the unresolved feeling and continued practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges through concrete images (bread, tea) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through planting seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV has distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied syntax; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and advances atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory and loss through specific details; risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
