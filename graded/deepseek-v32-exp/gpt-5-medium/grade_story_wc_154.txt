<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—grafting meaning without sealing wounds—is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the mother's and uncle's reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the room "unclenches" with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early, and the coral fragment's reprise as a key charges the final image without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the atrium and brain coral constraining choices and charging the closure. Sensory details (mist, vents breathing) are filtered through POV, and spatial choreography remains clear despite multiple characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in decrypting the cast, narrowing options and reweighting shared anxieties with cost legible in the mother's reach for the uncle's sleeve. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared anxieties emerges organically from particulars like the smudged cast and "Also Us" boats, with subtext in gesture and silence. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic compression is taught early and pays off at closure; dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("kestrels coil into sleep like commas") is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story synthesizes familiar elements (translator, conflict) with fresh, specific details like the brain coral as dictionary. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
