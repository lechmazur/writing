<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is deeply rooted in their vow, with interiority shown through embodied perceptions like "my name slid away like a coin." Micro-choices under pressure, such as playing hopscotch, reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final commitment to map faithfully is earned with visible cost in "legacy's burden settled on my shoulders." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; characterization is consistent and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through sensory layers and imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the house "rose slightly on its stilts of memory." Cost is legible in the burden settling, and orientation is clear early. Structure is coherent with one meaningful deepening, and the closure reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the ivy-veiled passage guiding entry and the film negative charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the POV, with elements like "hearth" and "coals" integrating into action. The environment actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping legacy faithfully escalates through accumulative discoveries like the diaries and film, driven by narrator agency in playing hopscotch and reading the letter. Cost is unmistakable in "legacy's burden settled on my shoulders," narrowing options under the textural lens. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of shirking with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and forgiveness emerges organically through images and actions, such as the film negative inverting brightness and the notes sounding like forgiveness. No direct statement or moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in silences and implications, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in poetic diction like "salt grammar of vanished tenants." Rhythmic control under pressure varies naturally, and any elision (e.g., the hopscotch game) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly dense in peaks like "ghost architecture," but clarity remains. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and the final image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized, transforming the concept of echo cartography through specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; originality stems from authentic vision and emotional specificity.</comment>
