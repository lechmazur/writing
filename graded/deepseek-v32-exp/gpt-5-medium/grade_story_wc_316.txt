<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is concrete and embodied, with earned change through the custody decision. Neri and Rae are distinct with complementary traits that pressure the narrator. Final choice is credible and forecloses a path with visible cost ("frost inside me drain").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern of complementary opposites building to closure. Joint custody decision is a decisive change with felt cost on-page. Orientation is clear early, and history rewriting motif pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo constrains choices (e.g., windroom sparring) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Clouds and statues evolve with the narrative, reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody tied to defeating numbness) escalates under accumulative lens through training and final test. Narrator's agency drives resolution with cost legible in emotional thaw. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of complementary opposites emerges from events and images, not statement, with ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the jar's vibration signaling consent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with elision taught early. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of ego death, clone custody, and floating dojo feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific detail and moral calculus.</comment>
