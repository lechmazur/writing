<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent with embodied interiority, but lacks internal conflict or meaningful change; motivation is clear but passive, with endurance rather than active choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is earned stasis with cost in "crumbling peace" and regenerative silence; orientation is clear early, and persistent oath shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting constrains choices (e.g., river forces retreat) and charges the final image; details are selective and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of witnessing is signaled early; escalation occurs through environmental pressures (flood, mushrooms) under accumulative lens, with cost legible in adaptation and renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence emerges organically from images and events; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, supported by subtext like "silence is not absence but compost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., origami swan mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear with high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts, and figurative language is purposeful, enhancing momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical elements (origami swan, regenerative silence) feels organic and inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
