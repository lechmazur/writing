<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "gentle radical" identity and motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" are consistently embodied in micro-choices, such as renaming the men with visible cost. Interior contradiction between "heat and frost" acts in scene, and the final renaming decision is earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist feels "the past loosen inside me," with cost legible in the final image. Causal drive lens holds throughout, with because/therefore linkages from the boy's request to the men's renaming. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting ("ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky") constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "ash drifted in slow halos" filtered through POV. The tessera and stepping stone function as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from the boy's request to confronting the men, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the men's new roles as "Bearer" and "Watch," foreclosing punishment. Dominant stake of empathy vs. justice tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "aberrant mercy" emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via renaming. Subtext operates in gestures like "kneel so the patterns can speak." No moralizing; complexity is embraced through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "wind moved like a careful surgeon." Voice modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, and dialogue (e.g., the boy's request) is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language like "a wound that refuses both bleeding and closure" is coherent and purposeful. No register drift or template cadence; sentences advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with empathy-driven renaming feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone ("warm coldness") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the tessera and bottle caps avoid template plots.</comment>
