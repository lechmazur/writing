<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like mapping the shelves leading to an earned closure. The final choice to light the wick forecloses her fragmented path with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara lights the wick, reconfiguring her purpose under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the final image. The keeper's thread design shapes tactics, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "oil, linen, and letters" filtering through Mara's POV. The lighthouse library and tarot cards constrain choices and charge the final image, where the light "widened the way a chest widens," meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake in Mara's internal conflict escalates through her agency in untangling threads and lighting the wick. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with pattern breaks, and cost is unmistakable as she commits to "keep the light tonight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as threads and light, offering a resonant non-literal answer to fragmentation. Subtext operates in gestures like the cards trembling with faces, avoiding moralizing and earning wisdom through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax like "gulls rode the wind like commas." Rhythmic control under pressure and purposeful elision (e.g., threads as paths) are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language, such as "light argued up the spiral," is coherent and advances the story, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse library and tarot thread-mapping feels inevitable, transforming tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
