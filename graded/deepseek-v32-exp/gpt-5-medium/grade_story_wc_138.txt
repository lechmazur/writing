<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied interiority. Lio's presence adds relational pressure, and the final choice to repurpose the amulet is earned by prior causality. However, Lio's character feels slightly underdeveloped, with his forgiveness arc summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the immortal gains purpose, cost is legible in the exchange of memories and softened refusal. The causal lens holds tightly from setup to emergence, with orientation anchored early and spatial mutiny integrating seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the prismatic escondite and solar storm constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "hummed against my palms" and "spectrum like carefully polished knives" are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around discovering "after goodbye" escalate through protagonist agency, culminating in a corridor walk that narrows options with visible cost (memories, forgiveness). Under the causal lens, pressure coheres and tightens, though the middle beat with Lio's arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the corridor of farewells and the amulet's revision, offering a non-literal answer to goodbye as "blueprint." Subtext operates in gestures and silences, such as Lio's laugh "in the same key as the hushed thunder," resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, immortal-centric voice that controls rhythm under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Lio's cynical nod, and elision (e.g., "a century I refuse to number") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates with scene needs. No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language like "hushed thunder is the dialect of things that are nearly born" is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of immortality, spatial mutiny, and goodbye, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
