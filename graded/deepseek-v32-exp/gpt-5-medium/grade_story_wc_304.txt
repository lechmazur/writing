<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in her relationship with her mentor, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., the grin she taught me). The final infusion action is earned by prior causality and training, foreclosing a path with visible cost in her being "unshaken and remade." No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost ("I was unshaken and remade"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to the climax. The emerald chip and method act as persistent constraints shaping tactics, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the skyborne grotto and aurora pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "slow drips," "aurora murmured"), filtered through POV. The environment constrains the ritual and mirrors internal states, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing one last spark) escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as she tunes the dial and infuses the balm. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation and the chip dimming. No coincidence; resolution earned by her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief and memory emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like the brush tapping sound. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the captured words and vision, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the narrator's profession and emotional state. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., listening for footsteps) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm control heighten clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "cloth rubbed on crystal"), with no register drift or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mortician sci-fi and lyrical grief rituals, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the emerald chip and threshold of stillness. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, and risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
