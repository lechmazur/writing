<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "I am calmly inventive," with micro-choices under pressure. Relationship with Fara serves as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their state. Minor hairline slip in occasional abstract phrasing, but final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change—fort shifts from "spectacle to hearth"—under causal lens, with felt cost in the redefinition of vigilance. Orientation is anchored early; plot coheres with because/therefore linkages from blackout to revolution. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of the quill holder shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "corridor tastes of iron and rain" filtering through POV. The luminous fort and blackout pressure choices, altering tactics. Key objects (bronze quill holder, sundial) constrain choices and charge the final image of the fort as a "lighthouse that agrees to listen."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent revolution against oppression—escalates under causal lens via protagonist agency: blackout triggers actions, meeting Fara, adjusting lights, and winning Captain Rhun. Cost is legible in the trade-off from "glare to glow." One meaningful tightening narrows options, but minor dip in tension during Rhun's arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like "guarding consent instead of fear." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the reconfigured fort, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity embraces ambiguity, e.g., "blackout remains unexplained to the records."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "locks I guard are singing with fear." Voice is poetic and controlled under pressure, with purposeful elision taught early. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as in Fara's "You are late." No head-hopping; rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, e.g., "winking hush." No loops or muddle in peak beats; closure image is sharp. Minor overwriting in isolated phrases, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fresh synthesis: silent revolution in a luminous fort using a quill holder transforms tropes through specific details. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and non-obvious angles make the concept indispensable, with closure feeling inevitable.</comment>
