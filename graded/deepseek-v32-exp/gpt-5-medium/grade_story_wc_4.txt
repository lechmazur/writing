<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's calm demeanor is consistently embodied and motivates the healing process, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing the highest band. Micro-choices like "my hands stay perceptively calm" reveal values but no internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure via conceptual repricing (mirror reveal and collective laughter) lands with felt cost in "relief often sounds like a bell." Early orientation and taught pattern ensure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins pressure choices by framing the ritual; specific sensory details like "wind smelled like old engines and moonlight" charge the final image where the corridor "holds, trembling."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of collective healing escalates through archivist's agency in gathering stories; cost is legible in the shift to "sturdier" laughter and the mirrored faces, though one major tightening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the map case's mirror and lavender; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as the town "breathing with a less fractured chest" reweights pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction ("bees stitched yellow punctuation") and rhythmic control under pressure reinforce voice without head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language like "crickets and machines cooling" is purposeful and clear, avoiding loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle archivist and collective healing feels inevitable; specific details (dove gray map case, arcs in photographs) transform the premise through grounded choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
