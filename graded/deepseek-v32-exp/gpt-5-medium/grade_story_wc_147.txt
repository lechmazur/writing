<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict between panic and stillness is embodied in key moments, such as overriding instinct in the narrow corridor. The final choice to use the vial and transmitter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk and effort. Micro-choices, like unsnarling the line, reveal a hierarchy of values focused on rescue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as the signal is sent and hope is restored, under a causal lens where actions like swimming to the temple and using the vial drive the outcome. Cost is legible in the protagonist's effort and the looming danger. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices, such as the temple's narrow corridors scraping the tank and the anemone-crusted doors, which pressure the protagonist's movements. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, like the "bruise of brown" silt. The temple's acoustics directly shape the climax, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from swimming to the temple to unsnarling the line and using the vial, narrowing options with each step. The dominant stake of saving the crew tightens as time runs short, with cost visible in the gauge needles and depth pressure. One meaningful reversal occurs when panic is overridden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the perfume vial evoking memories and the temple's hush, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to ephemerality and rescue without moralizing. Subtext operates in images, such as the vial as a "tiny captured moon," and the ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure, like "becoming a single held note." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the temple's nature) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no major loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though slightly dense in peaks like "gathered hush that hums," but clarity remains. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, such as during the surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a perfume vial and temple acoustics for rescue is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the concept is fully committed to with specific detail, transforming familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
