<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving his arc from witness to active custodian; his astonishment and perceptiveness are consistently shown through actions like opening the box and reading contextual clues, earning his final choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, as the protagonist accepts his role with cost legible in "pain threaded the present"; the covenant shapes tactics throughout, and orientation is clear early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the wasteland's scarcity pressuring the archive's role; the stained glass box and lectern charge the final image with mapped warmth, integrating environment into the climax with purposeful sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully with the queen's arrival, forcing the protagonist to answer for his survival under the accumulative lens; agency drives the tightening, and cost is felt in the tolerable stings and the box's warmth, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the box mosaicking silence, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the "blue road" and the hope for language's return, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and perceptive, with a distinct poetic voice that modulates under pressure; elision is taught and paid off in contextual reading, and no head-hopping occurs, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery; no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language coheres without muddle, especially in peak beats like the queen's appearance, ensuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes ghosts, apiary, and covenant in a fresh, non-obvious way; specific details like the stained glass box and burnt frame make it inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in lyric style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
