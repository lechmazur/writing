<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("exile curl tight around my throat") and micro-choices under pressure (decoding tapestry). Motivation to forgive oneself is clear and intensifies, driving higher-stakes choices. Final forgiveness is earned by prior causality with visible cost (tasting ashes from past mistakes).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (forgiveness after labyrinth overflows), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early (time-frozen village, exiled tutor). Causality is strong, with protagonist's actions (unspooling hush) leading to decisive change. Persistent constraint of past mistakes shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (time-frozen village) pressures choices and charges the final image (labyrinth overflowing). Sensory details are vivid and selective (dust rising, water trembling). Platinum labyrinth and tapestry constrain choices and are integrated into action, with spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible (ashes taste on wrong moves). Dominant stake (forgiveness) tightens through decoding tapestry, forcing a trade-off (incremental vs. immediate release). Pressure coheres and deepens with each pull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges from events and images (tapestry, labyrinth) without direct statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer through final image (labyrinth overflowing). Subtext operates in implication (unspooling hush as redemption). Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (chess tutor's pattern-reading). Voice is poetic and controlled, with rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; elision (woven hush) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence rhythms. No major loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("pigeons were suspended clouds"). Minor overwriting in peaks, but clarity maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes chess strategy and time magic with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
