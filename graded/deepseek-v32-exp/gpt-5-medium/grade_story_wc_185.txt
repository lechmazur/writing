<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotions like "my ribs clatter like thin cups." Micro-choices under pressure, such as examining ice and planting the bloom, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—marking the corridor—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "the bloom of hush did not erase the storms; it gave them rooms to pass through." Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern intensification leading to stillness. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, e.g., ice cracks guide actions and the caves "blessed me with a corridor." Sensory details like "air sounded like metal cooled under rain" are selective and purposeful. The echo chamber stone as a micro-setting charges the final image with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from examining ice to conjuring stillness. Dominant stake—finding quiet—tightens through meaningful deepening, with cost visible in the energy beings' softening. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between chaos and calm emerges through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "they do not leave; they learn where to be quiet." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "ripple-mark mapkeeper" and poetic rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression, like "hammered repose," is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences like "The bloom of hush must be planted where maps agree that shouting swallows its own tail." No loops or scaffold issues; figurative language is coherent and supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of energy beings, harmonic caves, and echo chamber stone feels inevitable. The "bloom of hush" concept is fresh and transforms familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
