<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Final choice to wake her stone self is earned by prior causality, showing contradictory impulses in scene. Cost is visible in her integration, foreclosing her old path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost on-page: "she was one again, the dreams not dismissed but worn like a ring." Inferred accumulative lens holds; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (bleeding starlight) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through POV. The cobalt grotto constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling dreams) escalates under accumulative lens through queen's agency in climbing and waking herself. Cost is legible in her renunciation of "ghost of unasked questions." One meaningful tightening narrows options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-discovery and power emerges through events and images, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the stone self integration. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as the wanderer's warnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., "You are late" exchange). Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "wind combed her braids." No scaffold or muddle in peak beats; closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of quest narrative with specific, grounded choices in imagery and character. Transforms tropes through lyrical risk-taking; freshness in the stone self confrontation feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
