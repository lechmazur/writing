<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through the journey, with embodied interiority like "credentials trembling" and "hunger of drought." The final choice to teach and be altered is earned by prior causality, showing credible endurance. However, some abstract language in peaks slightly reduces concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where the protagonist realizes the archive offers "permissions to feel" and emerges altered, with cost legible in "anguished joy." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of avoiding patterns pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with sensory details like "dust rose in quiet spirals" and "floor tiles hummed with hexagrams." The archive constrains choices, and micro-settings like the compass charge the final image, shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the landings, with protagonist agency in refusing to bargain and avoiding patterns, leading to revelation. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, and cost is felt in the alteration and teaching, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like "atoms of nostalgia" and "love responsibly," with subtext in actions rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, such as "twilight here was a verb." Rhythmic control under pressure, and purposeful elision in avoiding patterns is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor overwriting in peaks like "anguished joy threaded the visions" slightly reduces clarity. No significant loops or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archive exploration with unique elements like avoiding patterns and conceptual repricing feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is legible.</comment>
