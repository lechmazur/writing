<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final understanding that "hope is engineered" is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the effort to redirect flows. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the intern's stubborn curiosity versus the terminal's decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terminal "breathed out, and I breathed back," reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered details and actions. Orientation is clear early, and the janitor's involvement adds a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like "windows mirrored dusk" and "rainwater pooled in a ballroom." The terminal constrains choices, such as redirecting flows, and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting the terminal escalates through protagonist agency, such as rerouting gutters and flipping breakers, under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the transformed terminal and the janitor's shifted intentions. One meaningful tightening occurs when their collaboration unlocks new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope as an engineered system emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the terminal's rebirth, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the janitor's laugh and the redirected flows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as with the janitor. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, though minor density in figurative language slightly affects pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and concise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is purposeful, such as "the terminal breathed like a rehabilitated lung." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, though some metaphors are dense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-carnival spaceport and engineering hope feels inevitable, with specific details like the sextant piece and redirected flows. Risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through grounded character choices.</comment>
