<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "felt the weight of years settle on my tongue." The final choice to archive the memory is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in carrying the winter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist archives the memory, foreclosing the garden's repetition—and cost is legible in "a precise cold that did not sting." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with no orientation issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("moths drifted with ghostly resolve") and constrains choice, as the garden and fountain actively shape the protagonist's actions. The environment charges the final image, reinforcing the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the resonance process, with cost unmistakable in carrying the winter. The dominant stake of translating isolation into independence tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and imagery, such as "library of frost," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation and independence, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor overwriting exists but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements like the seashell and resonance structures, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
