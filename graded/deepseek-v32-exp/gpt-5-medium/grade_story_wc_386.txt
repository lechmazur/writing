<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; final choice to expose truth carefully is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the foreman's reaction and husband's quiet visit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost under a causal-hybrid lens; orientation is clear early, and the sequence from dreams to investigation to confrontation is tightly linked, with the foreman's lowered eyes and the globe's rest demonstrating a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the ice shrine and melted snow globe constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "candle-lit shrine" and "silt moves as if remembering" are filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from analyzing dreams to retrieving the globe to community confrontation; cost is legible in the foreman's swallowing and the quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges organically through events and images like the tapping and snow globe; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as the globe shines in "borrowed starlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a perceptual signature in phrases like "language of silt, steel, and memory"; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the globe's revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of ghost communication and investigative drama; specific details like the snow globe as evidence and risk-taking in lyric style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
