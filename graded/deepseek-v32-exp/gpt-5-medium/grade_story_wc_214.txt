<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with earned change in realizing his purpose to "polish marks into guidance." Motivation rooted in spiritual curiosity and past vulnerability compels higher-stakes choices under pressure, such as empathizing with machines and confronting ghosts. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though minor hairline slip in slightly over-articulated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the "flourishing stillness" that reweights solitude into connection. Cost is legible in the protagonist's cracked heart answering with a "gentler beat" and the station's thrumming at named ghosts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the station's decay and the yellow lantern glass directly shape the protagonist's tactics and the climax during the power failure. Sensory details like "copper and old tea" and "galaxy smelled like distance" are filtered through POV, with spatial choreography coherent. The lantern glass as micro-setting alters options and reprises in the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, from routine maintenance to the meteor burst and power failure, forcing a stance crystallization that deepens the stake of finding purpose. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional shift and the station's mapped "corridor of shadow." One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of ignorance, with visible price in the protagonist's vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the lantern glass and falling stars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of purpose through the final image of "polish them into guidance." Subtext operates in gestures like tracing arcs on cold glass, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, with the ending reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evidenced by rhythmic control in lines like "the galaxy smelled like distance, and I balanced both in my lungs." Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity while maintaining coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with zero loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "swift signatures of rocks writing on night," without muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the meteor burst, and clarity is maintained through concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes the cosmic janitor concept with specific lived detail, transforming maintenance into a spiritual practice. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with fresh inflections like the station's whispered stories.</comment>
