<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rafi's characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as freezing at vent fans and using somatic markers. His motivation roots in trauma and resilience, compelling higher-stakes choices like the gull rescue. The final earned stasis—folding the photograph steadily—is causally earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the pearl of stillness and steady trellis image. The accumulative/textural lens holds, weaving trauma and growth through patterns like the photograph and grafts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality remains intact with no teleporting or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the arboretum's glass roofs and lighthouse pressure Rafi's coping, while the cliff path and gull incident alter tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with no generic placeholder or white-room issues. Micro-setting (photograph, seeds) deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internal conflict with trauma) escalates under accumulative lens through agency-driven beats like the helicopter trigger and gull rescue, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the pearl of stillness and shoulder loosening. No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to closure with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—optimism anchored in realism via grafts, seeds, and doors not denial. Subtext operates in images like the photograph scarring and lighthouse blinking, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical perceptual signature, rhythm modulating under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., drone strike details) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present, as with Leda's task list. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, even in peak beats like the gull rescue. No overwriting, template cadence, or coherence issues; sentences propel momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of trauma recovery and horticulture, with specific, non-obvious details like somatic markers and wind-partnered seeds. Tropes are transformed through grounded choices; risk-taking in quiet narrative heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
