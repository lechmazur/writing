<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's "credibly curious" trait is embodied through concrete actions like asking the air questions, and the final choice to ring the bell is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the altered storm path. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic, shown in micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to listen rather than switch. No stock phrasing or emotional summary; flaws like patience balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the bell ringing alters the storm's intention, under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds without breaks; the rope splice and waiting for glue dry temper the climax. The cost is legible in the storm's faltering and the protagonist's shifted posture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the sanctuary's bell rope and glass floor pressure decisions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the clouds trudging like pilgrims and the anemometer fluttering thoughtfully. Micro-setting elements (rope, console) are integral to tactics, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the dominant stake of listening vs. noise tightening through micro-choices like opening shutters and ringing the bell. Cost is legible in the storm's rethreading and the valley station's reminder of budget audits. One meaningful deepening occurs as fear becomes guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges through particulars like the river speaking through ductwork and the bell's restraint, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the conceptual repricing of weather as witness rather than verdict. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as Reni lowering her hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in lyrical syntax and rhythm under pressure. Voice is consistent, with purposeful compression in lines like "listening distinguishes between thunder and rumor." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as with Reni's urging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "winds braided themselves into thin harps." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative pressure, and clarity is maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes elements in a non-obvious way, transforming the trope of a storm watcher through specific details like the bell rope's memory and microclimate tracking. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
