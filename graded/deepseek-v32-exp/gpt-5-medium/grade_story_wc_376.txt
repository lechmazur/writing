<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation for lost conversations is concrete and drives key choices; interiority is embodied in lines like "Words unsent collect in my ribs." Final refusal to gild lies is earned by prior causality with visible cost in wilting. Contradictory impulses act in scene when trembling at dishonesty yet pursuing truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages from plate fragment to map discovery and vault opening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration as vault release reweights candor with cost legible in "leaves relax" and postmaster's trembling. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and constraint of toxic sky shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: greenhouse city necessitates leaf-post, and toxic sky pressures survival. Sensory details like "condensate beaded along rails like punctuation" are selective and purposeful. Environment charges final image as truth mist feeds plants, altering outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of candor escalates under causal lens from personal refusal to collective action, driven by protagonist's agency. Cost is unmistakable in city dimming and postmaster's guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs when hatch opening forces trade-off between secrecy and truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges through particulars like wilting near lies and vault discovery, avoiding moralizing. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in "conversation were water after all," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like fogged windows from postmaster's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction like "gilded-leaf calligrapher." Voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping; elision in map discovery is taught and paid off. Rhythmic control is evident in varied sentence lengths supporting emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "frightened lung" is consistent and purposeful. Syntax accelerates with scene needs, e.g., short sentences in discovery beats. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes unique elements like leaf calligraphy and lost conversation archives with non-obvious angle on truth. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of tropes feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
