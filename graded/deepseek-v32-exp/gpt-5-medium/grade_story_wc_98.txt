<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion ("my doubt glowed like a lighthouse") and micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Iru serves as a crucible, forcing a decisive choice. Final planting is earned by prior causality and doubt, with visible cost in the monsoon's threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, building through images and dreams to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands with cost as the seed sprouts and the monsoon waits, reconfiguring the island's memory. Lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraint (monsoon) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory ("ancient ridge in bloom," "petals debate"), with the ridge and hollow constraining the key planting choice. Micro-setting charges the final image as the hollow "shaped like a sleeping ear" becomes where the island listens. Details are integrated into action and reflect POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting cultural memory) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase (dreams, Iru's conch) and agency-driven choices. Cost is legible in the monsoon's approach and the planting decision, narrowing options and foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and doubt emerges through concrete events and images (seed, conch, tree), not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as the tree sorts myths and stories resolve disputes, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, whimsical yet rigorous—modulating under pressure. Dialogue with Iru feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision (dreams) is taught and paid off at closure with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with high information density and varied syntax, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("water forgets our shapes while remembering our salt"). Read-aloud rhythm flows naturally, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept is original—fantasy island reality checker—synthesized with specific details (knowledge fruit, interpreted dreams) that feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in whimsical tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material with authenticity.</comment>
