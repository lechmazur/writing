<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "ache that facts bruise"). Final choice to publish truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost in reconciling facts and memory. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost legible in "grief to finish its interrupted sentence." Orientation is clear early; structure builds through discoveries without causality breaks. Persistent constraint of historical truth shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., station as "long throat of shadow" pressures investigation). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, integrated with POV bias. Recurring objects like ledger and ivy alter tactics and accumulate meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth vs. noble lies escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in uncovering clues. Cost is unmistakable in the decision to publish, foreclosing the path of silence. One meaningful tightening deepens the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer to mercy vs. truth without moralizing. Subtext in "shipments" vs. "passengers" and ledger margins enriches complexity. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is character-specific, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. No head-hopping; diction remains within plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "ivy shakes out a rain of seeds"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical investigation with fresh angle on noble lies; specific details like the illuminated letter and coal scar transform tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
