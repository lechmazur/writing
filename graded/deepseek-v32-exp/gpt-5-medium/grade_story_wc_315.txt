<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values; the final nod carries cost, and the "attentively inventive" trait constrains actions, but minor reliance on introspection slightly limits peak emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; orientation is clear early; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in "weight on my ribs loosens," and the past failure shapes tactics, making the reconfiguration resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices (e.g., cloud vortex forces route revision) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the arbor and lanterns integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving trust escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in revising the approach; cost is visible in the pilot's nod and loosened weight, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust and burden emerges through particulars like muscle memory and the watcher's burden, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the harness image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., "apologies blow away") is taught and paid off; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but slight overwriting in peaks (e.g., "trees that outgrew the ground") causes minor figurative muddle without harming closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes fresh elements (arbor above clouds, watcher's burden) with emotional specificity; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
