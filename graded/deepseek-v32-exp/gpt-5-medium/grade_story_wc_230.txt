<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's rationality and involuntary truthfulness are consistently embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hiding the eye, inviting inspectors) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final endurance ("fractured grace") is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the closure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("fractured grace is the only style we have left"). Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout via density increase and cadence shifts. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (ravine, orchard, storms) actively pressures choices and constrains tactics—inspectors refuse to cross the bridge, and the eye is hidden in a knot-hole. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., "ropes of rain," "smell of earth"), filtering through the POV's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety vs. external threat) escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency—inviting inspectors and using the eye reweights options with cost. The patrol's arrival forces a tightening choice, and the resolution forecloses paths with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., the glass eye as a "keeper," laughter snagging on throats), offering a resonant, non-literal answer to honesty and safety without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the girl's confession about her father.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise diction and rhythmic control under pressure ("truth coiled up my esophagus"). Voice modulations align with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., "occlude") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("orchard creaked like a chandelier") is purposeful and coherent, with syntax varying naturally to support rhythm. No artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes post-virus honesty, psychological tools, and ecological decay with specificity and risk-taking. The glass eye and discredited textbooks transform familiar tropes through grounded choices, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold structural and tonal choices heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
