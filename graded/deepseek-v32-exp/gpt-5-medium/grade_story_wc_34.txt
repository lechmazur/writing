<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the balladeer's motivation to articulate unspoken needs intensifies credibly, and the final commitment to translating is earned with visible cost in the enduring patience. Minor hairline slip: the internal contradiction could be more simultaneous in scene, but it's negligible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot under accumulative lens builds through patterned imagery to a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) at closure; the cost is legible in the balladeer's sworn dedication and the city's pulsing rhythm. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, with the courtyard, wires, and bolt plate constraining actions and charging the final image; sensory details like "air held a hum that tasted of rain" are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes around articulating needs escalate under accumulative lens through the storm's approach and ghost interactions, driven by balladeer's agency; cost is unmistakable in the city's transformation and the balladeer's trembling answer to thirst.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of communication and listening emerges through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the hinge metaphor; subtext in gestures like "cupping their hands for water" deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet consistent, and elision (e.g., "driftingly alert") is taught and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm with zero artifacts; figurative language like "the sky's drumskin" is coherent and purposeful, and propulsion is clear even in lyrical peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of ghost in code, balladeer, and graffiti art; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
