<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied sensory experiences. Micro-choices under pressure, such as pruning to teach rhythm, reveal values with cost. However, the final choice lacks strong contradictory impulses acting in scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sharing of soup reconfigures community meaning, with cost felt in pruning cuts. Under the accumulative/textural lens, pattern of memory accumulation holds, and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraint of ruins shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the rusted greenhouse constraining choices and charging the final image through sensory details like "cracked terracotta" and "glass and memory less ash." Sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating beauty from ruins escalates through protagonist's agency in planting, pruning, and tasting, with cost legible in the "bitter" sap from cuts. Under accumulative lens, pressure tightens via memory density, but escalation lacks multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and gentle rebellion emerges organically from particulars like dumplings and dandelions, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the shared soup. Subtext operates in gestures and images, avoiding moralizing, though some thematic statements edge toward echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., memory fragments) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language coherent and purposeful. No significant artifacts or loops; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in peak beats, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of tasting memories and knowledge fruit offers a fresh synthesis, transformed through specific details like "soup the color of old copper." Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
