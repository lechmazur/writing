<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nessa's characterization is deeply realized with clear motives rooted in dual allegiance; internal conflict is embodied in scenes with her brother, and her final choice to realign the rafts is earned by prior causality and visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and emotions are concrete without diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal-hybrid lens with coherent escalation; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the raft realignment buys a season, with cost legible in "I knew it bought us only a season." Orientation is clear early, and the foundation stone chip shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the raft city and carnival pressuring choices through sensory details like "tents breathed like lungs"; the environment constrains the climax via the raft realignment, and micro-setting (chip) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes around gentrification escalate through Nessa's agency, from encoded graffiti to the liaison confrontation; cost is unmistakable in the temporary victory, and pressure tightens under the causal lens with one meaningful deepening that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the graffiti and chip; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "hope does not erase desperation," avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with a perceptual signature ("I think in loops and ledgers"); POV is stable, dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision (e.g., graffiti mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, and sentences advance story momentum, e.g., "Hope does not erase desperation, but it teaches it to sing on key."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of raft city, culture shock absorber, and encoded resistance; tropes are transformed through specific details, and risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
