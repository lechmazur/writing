<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with micro-choices like carving the collar instead of a lion revealing hierarchy of values under grief. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance—accepting absence—is earned by prior causality with visible cost in "absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts loss, foreclosing restoration with cost legible in the decision not to restore the tag. Orientation is clear early, and the knot-to-scar transformation charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through POV, with the rain-beaded skylight and ash wood constraining choice (e.g., the knot becoming a scar). Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, charging the final image of the collar and crystallized time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in her carving decisions, leading to acceptance of absence. Protagonist agency drives deepening, with cost unmistakable in the thumb press on the unscuffed tag. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss and acceptance emerges organically through images like the collar and knot, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the carving's incomplete restoration, reweighting prior material with poignant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that reflects her grief-strained attention. Elision (e.g., "he is the rhythm of her hands") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("kettle is a metronome for grief") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of circus widowhood with woodcarving ritual, transforming grief tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
