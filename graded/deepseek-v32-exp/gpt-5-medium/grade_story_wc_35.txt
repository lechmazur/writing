<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Chef's motivation to sandpaper memories is clear and drives key choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "mouth full of borrowed thunder"); final decision to cook remorse is earned with visible cost in keeper's change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as keeper stands taller, subsuming memory; accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; orientation is clear early; causality tight from pavilion discovery to cooking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (puddles guide recipes, pavilion evokes emotion) and charges final image; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens (discovery to cooking); cost is legible on-page in keeper's emotional transformation; dominant stake of handling remorse tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and transformation emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in puddles and coral enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent; no head-hopping; prose reflects character's mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold; minor overwriting in figurative language but clarity maintained; propulsion supports accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and organic (chef tasting memories, coral archiving remorse); synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
