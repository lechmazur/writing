<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to capture the dream is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., deciding to let the dream go). Interiority is concrete through embodied perception, though some abstraction in peak beats slightly limits contradiction. Final renunciation is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when the dream is named and released. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by pattern of whispers and light. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact through imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (archipelago, library) is vivid and sensory, constraining choices (e.g., dream flees east) and charging the final image. Micro-setting elements like the watercolor palette and camera are integrated into action, with selective detail supporting atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from pursuit to confrontation with the sea. Cost is legible in the acceptance of absence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sea questions the price, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pursuit and absence emerges through particulars (e.g., dream's footprints, map uncurling) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the dream's escape, reweighting prior material with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "keeper of unlit dawns"). Voice is poetic yet controlled, and elision (e.g., dream's dialect) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variation, advancing story without loops. Minor overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "tide held its breath") is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of librarian, dream, and photography feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style. Specific details (e.g., glass plates, cipher) transform familiar tropes through character and setting, heightening stakes.</comment>
