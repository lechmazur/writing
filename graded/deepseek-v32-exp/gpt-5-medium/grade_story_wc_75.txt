<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion; curator's fear of becoming an embalmer versus hope in baking method reveals contradictory impulses. Final choice to accept the lens is earned through prior causality with visible cost in "I felt unworthy, but worthy workers are rare." Micro-choices under pressure, like baking initials, reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the curator's acceptance of the lens and promise to return, reconfiguring his role. Events build through accumulation of images and actions without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral to choices; grotto city and waterfall pressure tactics (dampness affects wax, lens selects survivals). Recurring objects (lens, bread) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like "beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing dying arts) escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist agency (baking bread, testing endurance with lens). Cost is unmistakable in softened wax taking faces and people weeping. One meaningful tightening occurs when names are carried into spray, foreclosing options and reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges through particulars like baking initials and lens use; subtext operates in gestures (Senka giving lens). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "history rises warm, eaten, and therefore enduring." No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and consistent ("rosewater dread"). No head-hopping; experimental lyric prose is taught and legible. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven (e.g., Senka's questions).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "waterfall threw cold lace"). Sentences advance story without obscuring closure; clarity maintained in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements (museum guide, drowned provinces, opera lens, bread baking) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; transformation test passed.</comment>
