<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion under pressure; micro-choices like cradling the scrap reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of emotional insulation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with felt cost when the protagonist assigns museum value to the scrap, reweighting facts and memory; orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry setting constrains choices and charges the final image with echoes; sensory details like "rock dust frosting my boots" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias to mirror internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotional insulation vs. memory escalates through the scrap's discovery, forcing a tightening choice that forecloses detachment with cost; agency is clear in the cataloging decision under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and echo emerges through particulars like the scrap and quarry, without moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the museum recommendation, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure, such as "echo valley longing made visible," with any elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; metaphors like "evaporated applause" are coherent and purposeful, maintaining clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ex-roadie and appraiser roles feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure reconfigures familiarity through specific detail.</comment>
