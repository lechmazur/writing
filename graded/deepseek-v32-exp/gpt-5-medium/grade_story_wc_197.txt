<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her mother's erased history, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict and growth are earned, culminating in a decisive change where she feels braver. The final choice to activate the program is motivated by prior causality, with visible cost in the risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from motivation to action, leading to an on-page closure where voices are restored. Orientation is anchored early, and the cost is legible in the risk and the program's activation. The inferred lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure reconfigures options with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through Mara's POV, such as the "auric lagoon" and "flooded tram yard." The environment constrains choices and charges the final image, as the lagoon directly enables the program's activation. Specificity is high without generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, from finding the key to activating the program. The dominant stake of restoring voices tightens through her actions, with cost legible in the risk and the implied consequences. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resistance and memory emerges through events and images, not direct statement, with subtext in symbols like the "singing hinge." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of voices returning, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and first-person implied, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's poetic observations. Voice modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., the map's mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; rhythmic control is strong under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and vivid imagery without loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story and character, with varied rhythm and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in places (e.g., "tyranny of indifference" repetition) but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of revised histories and coded freedom, transformed through specific character choices. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical approach that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premises or template plots.</comment>
