<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to prove coincidences have meaning is clear and drives choices; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as feeling the pavilion remember laughter. Relationship with Lio deepens stakes, and final rekindling is earned with visible cost in shared effort. Minor weakness: some emotional moments lean slightly abstract, but overall characterization is strong and coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost felt in the beam's exhale and communal response; Accumulative lens holds through patterned imagery. Orientation is clear early, and coincidences complicate without resolving. Slight convenience in Lio's arrival prevents higher score, but structure supports closure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the glass humming pavilion and shard of hush constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "moths, and stories snipped by winds" are selective and purposeful. Environment actively shapes tactics, such as using the shard to silence noise for retrocognition, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake in proving coincidences and rekindling the beacon escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases, like the prism's fracture and Lio's map aligning. Protagonist agency drives tightening, with cost legible in the collaborative effort. Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, though minor reliance on it slightly reduces agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coincidence as choreography and belonging emerges through particulars like the star paths and shard reprise, without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the grammar of belonging." Subtext operates in imagery and silence, such as the hush shard revealing fallen constellations, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present, as in Lio's exchange. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, though minor register consistency keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language, like "ribbon that hummed harmony." No loops or scaffold artifacts; rhythm supports scene needs. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors doesn't obscure closure, earning near-top marks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of post-collapse retrocognition and glass architecture, transforming tropes with specific details like the shard of hush. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable, meeting the 9+ test for non-obvious integration.</comment>
