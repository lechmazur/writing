<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as his hands as "maps of roads" and the final shift in the bargain. The relationship with the woman acts as a crucible, forcing a reconfiguration with visible cost. Contradictory impulses are present in scene, and the earned renunciation aligns with prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the "bargain shift" and "pathway with milestones." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection to a legible before/after change. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks harm the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects like the "cracked porcelain box" and "moonlit ridge path" constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details (e.g., "boots whispering on grit") filtered through the firefighter's POV. The environment pressures the meeting and reinforces theme without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the stake of "translating pain" tightening through the interaction and repair of the paper children. Cost is legible in the "bargain shift" and emotional weight, foreclosing paths without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the box and paper children, with subtext in gestures (e.g., "she did not hide her face"). The ending offers a non-literal answer through "making it legible" without moralizing, and ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, rhythmic control ("hard softness," "cracked cup" dialogue). Perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision (e.g., reflective blocks) is taught and pays off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is cohesive and purpose-driven, even in peak beats (e.g., "translator with burned fingers"), and propulsion remains clear through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of trauma and healing through specific details (porcelain box, paper children) that feel inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
