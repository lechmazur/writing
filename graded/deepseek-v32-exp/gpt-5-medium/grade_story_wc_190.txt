<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Operator and mathematician exhibit deep interiority with contradictory impulses (logical speech vs. turbulent hands); final comfort is earned through micro-choices and interaction, with cost visible in her unclenching shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in storm glass clearing and her breathing; orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (gondola, prism terrace) constrains choices (baffles, velvet alter sound) and charges final image (light geometry); sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of comfort vs. grief escalate under accumulative lens; operator's agency catalyzes change, cost unmistakable in mathematician's loosened shoulders and ceased computations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and comfort emerges organically from images (storm glass, quiet) and actions; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; dialogue carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and sentence structures; no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of silence and transit; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
