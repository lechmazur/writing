<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as handling the valve and listening to absences. The woman's motivation is clear and conflicted, rooted in her exile experience. The final choice to give the valve back is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the shift from voids to channels. Contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early with who, where, and when anchored. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, building meaning through fragments and images. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated." The persistent constraint of absence shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "quay stones glisten with rinsed salt" filtered through POV. The harbor and valve function as micro-setting that constrain choices and charge the final image. The environment pressures tactics, such as using the window and valve in practice. Specificity supports the theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compiling fragments into meaning is signaled early and escalates through agency, like the archivist using the valve and asking for taps. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases reweight the stake, with cost visible in the effort to remember. The final image reconfigures options with felt cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence and return emerges through particulars like the valve and tapping, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture and image, e.g., "traces survive if we build them into practice." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of absences. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "gulls punctuate them." Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without sluggishness. No register drift or artifact issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing absence, memory, and return through specific details. Tropes are transformed via grounded choices, like the archivist's role. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
