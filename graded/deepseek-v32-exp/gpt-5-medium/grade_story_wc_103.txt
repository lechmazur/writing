<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied interiority and credible micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance of cost is earned through prior causality, such as the library fire memory, and the change from shard to ring reconfigures stance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a conceptual repricing where the halo fragment becomes a ring, accepting the fading present with felt cost in "the cost is welcome if I can read its texture." Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure teaches its pattern by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with selective sensory details like "ink sweating like dew" and "roots braided into rooms." Environment actively shapes tactics, such as the bridge thickening beneath the protagonist, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grappling with grief escalates through protagonist's agency with the halo fragment, leading to a cost-legible acceptance in "the cost is welcome." Under accumulative lens, density increases with each memory shard, forcing a trade-off between past and present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time and grief emerges through concrete images like fading photographs and the library fire, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "the present is a continual photograph fading," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "paths elongate into whispers." Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression and no head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "hyperbolic geometry, every curve birthing more curve" slightly muddles peak beats. No major artifacts or loops; clarity remains at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maze design, time exploration, and grief feels inevitable, with risk-taking in non-linear structure that heightens stakes. The halo fragment's transformation and garden's logic are fresh and integral to closure.</comment>
