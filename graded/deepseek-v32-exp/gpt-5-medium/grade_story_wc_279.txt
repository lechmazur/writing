<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion like "shoulders fell, a small landslide." Micro-choices under pressure, such as interjecting, reveal hierarchy of values. Final stance crystallization is earned through prior causality, but minor abstraction in lines like "belief is a kind of finger" slightly reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost legible in "the emergent hush rode home in breathing." Orientation is clear early, and pattern accumulation through sand mandala and hush leads to decisive shift without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated, constraining choices and charging the final image; the grotto's "ribs seemed to breathe" and the sand mandala shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with mist and limestone enhancing atmosphere without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in interjecting, leading to social weather change with cost in the bearded man's confession. Dominant stake of discovering meaning tightens meaningfully, though the shift is more gradual than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the sand mandala and tile flake, with subtext in gestures like the child's touch. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "stay messy long enough for pattern to step forward," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature, e.g., "chalk is a listening stone." Experimental elision like "lilac unease" is taught and paid off, and dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but minor overwriting in phrases like "delicate but sure, like dusk deciding whether to commit to night" slightly muddles clarity. No loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements like chalk artist and unlearning feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric style heightening stakes. Specific details like the tile flake and emergent hush avoid derivative premises and support coherence.</comment>
