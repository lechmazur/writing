<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like shelving by curvature revealing hierarchy of values. Motivation to find where stories live drives the narrative, but agency remains observational rather than decisively altering tactics under high pressure, limiting escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the librarian sees the "weather" of stories, reweighting the quest with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; orientation is clear early, and structure coheres in a single scene with reflective depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with sensory details like "ozone and printer's ink" and the library as micro-setting constraining choices (e.g., shelving by curvature). Recurring objects like the scarf charge the final image, elevating atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding where stories live) escalate through accumulative density, with agency in shelving and observing leading to a deepening. Cost is legible in the final image, but protagonist's passive role limits pressure under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like "coastlines" and "curvature," with subtext in gestures and silence. Ending offers a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is strong, and purposeful elision (e.g., "map unrolls itself") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent even in peaks, and syntax accelerates with scene needs, though occasional abstraction slightly mutes clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of science and poetry feels inevitable, with specific details like hyperbolic geometry shelving transforming tropes. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is fully integrated.</comment>
