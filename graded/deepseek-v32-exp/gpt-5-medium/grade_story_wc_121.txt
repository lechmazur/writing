<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final surrender of gravity is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the shadow's return. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as hovering versus lowering, enhancing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the shadow's witness and time resuming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns building coherently. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the instant shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "cooled wires and wet stone" filtering through POV. The viaduct and puddles constrain choices and charge the closure, acting as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from hovering to surrendering, with cost legible in the timeline stabilization. Dominant stake of self-conquest tightens meaningfully, foreclosing the path of flight with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions, such as the tablet's erasure, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on surrender. Subtext operates in implication, like "do not outrun what follows you," without moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective, e.g., "rainlight," and any elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with the character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure, e.g., "branching possibilities like ferns." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a non-obvious synthesis of elements, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, such as the procedural generation concept. Specificity anchors universals, avoiding template plots.</comment>
