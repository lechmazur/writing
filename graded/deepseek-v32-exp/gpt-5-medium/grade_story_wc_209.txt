<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in artistic curiosity, with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., waiting in the loft). Final realization is earned through causality, though internal conflict could be more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image ("night is the gentlest daylight"). Orientation is clear early, and constraints shape the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory (e.g., cathedral glass, pavilion), constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency (studying glass, using postcards), with cost felt in time and effort. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, not statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is rich in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, and propulsion is clear even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, synthesizing art, botany, and philosophy with specific details. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
