<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, driving choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied through specific actions like interpreting clouds and using the mallet. The final endurance is earned with visible cost in the effort to transform the storm. However, minor passivity in some beats slightly reduces agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) as the storm passes and the orchard survives, with cost legible in "the orchard rang with weather learning to be orchestra." The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the pattern of resistance builds cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the floating orchard constraining tactics against the gale. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the prophet's POV, e.g., "clouds dragged their hems low and hoarse." The environment charges the final image, reinforcing survival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (survival) escalate through the prophet's agency in dubbing sounds and deploying tools, with cost visible in the collective effort. Under the accumulative lens, density increases as threats are transformed. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gale shifts focus to the tower's song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles emerges organically through actions and imagery, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer with "the clouds rewrite their letters into silence," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Zaya's strikes summoning bees.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature focused on sound and resonance. Voice controls rhythm under pressure, e.g., "dub the starboard slosh the Bass of Anchors." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "resonance was a drawing that sound made inside things." Sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency, especially in storm beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing floating orchards and sonic resistance into a cohesive whole. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the mallet's evolution. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
