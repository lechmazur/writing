<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass-orchid caretaker's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority (e.g., "my heartbeat falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice") and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of romance for stewardship is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the relief and past regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the caretaker's relief and the library's hushed atmosphere. The structure is cohesive, with orientation anchored early, and the wind's warning tightens pressure meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The opal library setting constrains choices and charges the final image (e.g., the balcony release), with sensory details filtered through the caretaker's POV. Specificity is purposeful, such as the "velvet pillow" and "cloudskin," enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) escalates through the caretaker's agency in responding to the wind's warning and sewing the crack, with cost legible in the trembling palm and salt-dust relief. The deepening changes knowledge and reweights options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory and stewardship emerges through concrete events and images (e.g., the chime repair and petal release), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, with subtext in gestures like sweeping dust into jars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "I hum the catalog number..."). Voice is poetic yet coherent, with no head-hopping; elision (like the wind's whisper) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("wick a mothwing of cooled thunder") is consistent and clear, supporting propulsion. No scaffold sentences or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes memory, loss, and stewardship in a non-obvious way, with specific details (e.g., "needles of moonbone") feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures prior material.</comment>
