<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concretely embodied through specific imagery (e.g., "pockets jangling with hinges and promises"), and the final renunciation ("I stay, though the wind-ladders groan") is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, such as regret both hoarded and spent, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) where the truce with the ghost reweights options with felt cost ("I stay, though the wind-ladders groan"). Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of eroded ambitions shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the kinetic lagoon and micro-setting objects (e.g., disposable camera wheel, turbines) constraining choices and charging the final image ("A turbine becomes a kettle"). Sensory details are integrated into action, reflecting POV bias without generic clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, with regret as a bargaining chip narrowing options and leading to the truce; cost is legible in the promises made ("I admit... I forgive... I promise to rebuild"). Dominant stake (negotiating with the ghost) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (e.g., eroded ambitions sinking in the lagoon), with subtext in gesture and implication; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed tools and habits, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "Time smears, and ambition, once sharp as tin, has eroded into sludge"). Purposeful elision (chronological confusion) is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "windmills turn the water into memory"), and closure is undulled by artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes surreal and emotional elements with specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core concept (eroded ambitions) is fully committed to with transformative detail.</comment>
