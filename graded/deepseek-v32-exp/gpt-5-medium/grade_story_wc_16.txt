<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "trembling with cautious exuberance." The final choice to compose promises and revise with Lio is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional shift. Contradictory impulses act in scene, e.g., "carefully reckless" balancing risk and caution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Lio's return and joint revision, costing the hush of the past. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with promises building density. Orientation is clear early; cost is legible in "lamplight seemed a promise kept." Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: archive "listens," shelves have "throats," influencing the protagonist's composition. Micro-setting (ink well, Breviary) charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, e.g., "dust motes hung like annotations," filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: composing promises invites Lio's return, deepening stakes. Cost is legible in Lio's "brittle" voice and shoulders lowering. Dominant stake (restoring trust) tightens through meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust as "choreography" emerges from particulars like the suite of promises and joint revision. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, e.g., Lio stepping out from shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: "dust motes hung like annotations." Voice is lyrical and controlled under pressure, e.g., "symphonies of truth." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when Lio speaks. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "ink breathing into letters shaped like opened doors." Clarity and propulsion maintained, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of linguist, archive, and promises feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details like the Breviary and stele anchor freshness, transforming familiar trust themes.</comment>
