<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The neighbor's enigmatic nature adds depth, though slight abstraction in his characterization prevents a higher score. Final choice to take the seal is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with clear orientation; closure is a Conceptual Repricing via the building's admission and the seal's transfer, with felt cost in the sigh and mortar's sentence. Persistent constraint of the seal shapes tactics, and cost is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the building and seal constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, though minor density in description slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from tea sessions to the rooftop interrogation, narrowing options with cost legible in the building's revelation. One meaningful tightening forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of agreed-upon lies and shelter emerges through events and images, not statement, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the building's sentence. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; elision is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax with clear propulsion; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors prevents a higher score, but closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sentient buildings and language themes feels inevitable, with risk-taking in poetic prose that heightens stakes. Specificity in details and transformation of tropes through character choice.</comment>
