<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's gently persistent nature is embodied through actions like standing silent during the patrol, and the collective "we" POV provides concrete interiority. The final choice to polish and rehang the bell is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the community's endurance. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with the bell reflecting faces, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear early, and the patrol scene tightens pressure meaningfully. Cost is legible in the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and bell constrain choices and charge the final image, with vivid sensory detail (e.g., "frost prints, a broom, and that silver glint"). Setting is woven into action, such as the arbor hosting midnight runs, and spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival escalates under accumulative lens through density increases like the patrol encounter, which narrows options. Mara's agency in standing firm and adapting tactics drives escalation, with cost felt in the risks taken during food runs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Themes of anonymity and resilience emerge through particulars like the bell's rings and intergenerational pairings, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the bell rehung for the wind, reweighting prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("everything after that felt like listening to a far-off choir"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision (e.g., anonymous donors) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("a tide that returned") serves momentum, and sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere cohesively. No clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of community resistance via the bell concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking in collective POV heightening stakes. Specific details like the bell's dents and the constellation naming transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
