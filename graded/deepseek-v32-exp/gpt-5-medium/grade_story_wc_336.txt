<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives her choices, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as pruning scars and interacting with the child. The final planting of the seed is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the effort to sustain memory. However, the attribute "insatiably creative" feels slightly abstract and less integrated into contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the seed planting and valley's renewed memory, carrying felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds through patterned imagery, and orientation is clear early. The lens holds without ambiguity, and cost is legible in the final image of the seed weaving worlds all night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the parapet and waterfall constraining choices (e.g., the seam for planting) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Miren's POV, such as the mossed stone and waterfall's mist, integrating environment into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Miren's agency under the Accumulative lens, from pruning to engaging with the child, tightening the stake of preserving wonder. Cost is legible in the release of scents and the seed's hunger, foreclosing options for mere utility. The child's arrival deepens the conflict without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, such as the seed capturing essence and the pruning weaving worlds, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and wonder. Subtext operates in gestures like the child's jar reflection, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable single POV and rhythmic control under pressure, such as in the description of the seed's glow. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present (e.g., the child's plea), and perceptual signature is consistent, with purposeful elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "waterfall stitched her to the slope," with no register drift or muddle in peak beats. Minor density in some lines doesn't harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of memory and essence through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, transforming familiar themes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight, with originality in the concept of weaving worlds.</comment>
