<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like playing softly to avoid statues. Internal conflict between fear and determination acts in scene, and the final choice to play is earned by prior causality with visible cost of potential failure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; heart rhythm signaling adds depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change as statues unclench and orchard reawakens, under a causal drive lens with because/therefore linkages. Orientation is anchored early with sky-bridge, orchard, and statues. Cost is legible in "If I failed, the statues would lock..." and persistent constraint of statues policing shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like fog licking iron and statues' humming eyes. Environment constrains choices by forcing soft playing, and the locust shell as micro-setting charges the final image when cradled by a statue. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reawakening beauty without punishment escalates under causal lens through protagonist's agency: playing softly, using heart rhythms, and locust shell mute. Cost is unmistakable in the risk of failure, and escalation narrows options as statues respond, leading to a trade-off that forecloses paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free through attention emerges from events and images like the locust shell and heart rhythms, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "beauty does not beg; it remembers..." subtext in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing while reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic voice that modulates under pressure, e.g., rhythm shifts in climax. Purposeful elision like "gap between knowing and understanding" is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "locust shell rattles... empty as a bell," and clarity is maintained in peak beats. No register drift or template cadence; sentences advance story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes with fresh angle through heart rhythm signaling and enchanted orchard, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Transformation test passed; no close echoes.</comment>
