<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible when the archivist steps back and the couple remakes their covenant.

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like sea thrift and barnacles woven into action. The environment pressures the characters' movements and memories, making it indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as the archivist's method of recalling proximate causes deepens the stakes and leads to the reunion with cost felt in the emotional weight. The dominant stake of repairing the relationship tightens through specific, earned beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the locket and proximate causes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and covenant without moralizing.

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic, controlled rhythm under pressure.

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a walnut-ink archivist preserving moments through proximate causes is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.
