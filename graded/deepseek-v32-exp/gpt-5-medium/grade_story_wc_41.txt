<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied emotions and concrete interiority; the prophet's precognitive forgetfulness and echo-clinging drive consistent micro-choices under pressure, and his final reset of markers is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as he accepts forgetting and sets markers, with cost legible in "loved them for it" and the tide's movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices (e.g., fog influences driftwood arrangements, statues constrain chalk use); environment charges the final image with the garden "remembering" for him.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency under accumulative lens; his attempts to capture echoes deepen into acceptance, with cost unmistakable in the closure's foreclosed paths and temporal loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory and time emerges through particulars like chalk and driftwood, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of reset markers and accepted forgetting, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, with purposeful elision (e.g., "precognitively forgetful") taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic variety without loops or artifacts; figurative language ("gulls braided their cries into static") is coherent and enhances momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory tropes through specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
