<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is a specific trait that consistently guides their perception and actions, such as seeing by "edges and weights," which deepens interiority. Their motivation to "mirror the sky inside walls" is dramatized through urgent choices under pressure, like using the coin and painting as the building falls. The final endurance—learning limits and leaving the mural—is earned with visible cost (destruction), though internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mural survives the implosion, reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost ("the sky may live on walls"). The accumulative lens holds, building pressure through stillness and time. Causality is tight: the coin's use leads to the safe, and the foreman's countdown forces the climax. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tree trunk library setting constrains choices (e.g., the coin must match growth rings) and charges the final image ("the dawn still glows on the bark"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "dust jumps" and "motes," filtered through the POV's urgency. Micro-setting (the coin, resin) actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: searching for the atlas, using the coin, and painting under time pressure. The dominant stake (completing the mural before demolition) tightens meaningfully, with cost legible in the building's destruction. However, the foreman's external pressure remains somewhat passive, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: limits, art, and endurance are explored via the coin, tree rings, and mural without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a sky that could survive the fall"—reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images like the "faint indentations" echoing memory and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("see by edges and weights"). Voice is poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure ("my breath chooses careful places"). Elision (e.g., the guild's vanishing) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural (foreman's murmur), advancing plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, accelerating with the countdown. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dust into motes"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere, with clarity in peak beats like the implosion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes face-blindness, a tree library, and art in a non-obvious way that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., "coin trapped in resin") create freshness, and the closure image transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
