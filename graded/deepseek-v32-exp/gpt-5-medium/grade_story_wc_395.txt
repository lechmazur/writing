<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority like "I felt the sensed absence turn solid." The final choice to surface files is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with cost, though contradictory impulses are not deeply dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change with legible cost when she risks her job. Orientation is clear early, and the path from lie to discovery follows because/therefore linkages, with the numbers as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting like the "deep vault" and "social network archive" pressures choices and charges the final image with the talisman. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with the Sink system constraining access.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes of truth versus job security escalate through protagonist's agency, driven by discoveries like the Driftwood file. Cost is unmistakable in the climax when she chooses voice over safety, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory and erasure emerge through particulars like the numbers and mission patch, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via "rerouting the stream." Subtext operates in imagery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic and attentive—e.g., "the silence was shaped like a missing person." Rhythmic control under pressure, and any elision (like the Sink's mechanics) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, e.g., "like archivists sweeping a beach at night," and sentences advance story momentum clearly, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of digital archives and grief feels inevitable, with specific details like the mission patch and node IDs. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the premise is transformed through grounded choices.</comment>
