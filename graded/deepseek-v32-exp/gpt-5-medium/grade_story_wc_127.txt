<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dealer's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits; Rhea's internal conflict is embodied and contradictory. Final choice (Rhea taking the petal) is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the transformation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, e.g., dealer's decision to charge little and write nothing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Rhea's steady eyes and the dealer's satisfaction. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs as the counterfeit emotion subsumes cold edges, foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains choices through static electricity and resin breath, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "sandalwood listened for regret." Body as micro-setting (hairs lifting) alters tactics and deepens interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fusing insight with empathy) escalates under accumulative lens through dealer's agency and Rhea's response. Cost is legible in the balanced hungers of affection and detachment. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and options, e.g., petal curling as "satisfied with humane arithmetic."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths and transformation emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer via Rhea's map becoming pulse. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, e.g., the rough spark and laugh. No moralizing; complexity embraced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is lyrical and consistent under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, e.g., Rhea's confession about the herd. Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, as in "the static purred around her."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, e.g., "a little fox of static." Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of counterfeit emotion dealer is fresh and non-obvious; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyrical style and accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (e.g., blotter petal, static electricity) anchor universals and charge closure.</comment>
