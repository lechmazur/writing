<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotions like "my chest shook with its patient violence." Final choice to name oneself is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving the dock. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the crowd's silence and the protagonist's step. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with imagery patterns leading to resonance. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in "tenderness is braver when it is witnessed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the island and sublittoral fringe constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, like "eelgrass combed the water for lost names." Environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from island's appearance to scrimshaw discovery and whale's call. Cost is unmistakable in the crowd's heavy silence and the protagonist's detachment. Dominant stake of self-acceptance tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of identity and non-violence emerges through events and images, like "kissing the knife she no longer needed." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is poetic yet consistent, with no head-hopping. Elision is taught and paid off in closure, as in "my newest, oldest voice."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven, like "chain singing as it learns it was never a chain." Clarity and propulsion maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pirate lore and self-discovery feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, such as non-violent piracy. Specificity anchors universals without abstraction.</comment>
