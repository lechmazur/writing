<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and motivation are clear and consistent, driving higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "guilt" and "choking beauty." Final atonement is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the rite. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as welcoming beauty amidst pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the final image of carrying repentance home. Orientation is clear early; structure builds through patterns like the crack and custom. Persistent constraint of lost time shapes tactics and ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, e.g., "midnight glade above clouds" and "lantern insects," constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, enhancing atmosphere. Micro-setting (saucer, cards) actively pressures the protagonist's rites.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding lost time escalates through protagonist's agency in the rite, confessing specific failures. Cost is legible in released seconds and completed lullaby. Under accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time and motherhood emerges through events and images, not statement; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in gestures like the crack as prophecy. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, e.g., the family custom reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with poetic voice and rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, e.g., "onyx-ink cartomancer." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "moon lay like a pale throat." Sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative build; no clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of motherhood, time, and cartomancy feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes. Specific details like the family custom transform familiar tropes. Closure reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>
