<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal conflict between shame and trust is embodied in micro-choices; final renunciation of shame earned through prior causality with visible cost when "the old shame fall away." Sori's quiet enthusiasm consistently pressures the protagonist's decisions, making the relationship a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of "the universe, not expanding but remembering itself," reweighting uncertainty as purpose. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-building with coins and static; orientation is clear within first paragraph, and causality tightens through prophecy fulfillment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ambered observatory deck constrains choices (e.g., turning the dome) and charges the final lens image; sensory details like "gas clouds thick as fossilized sap" are filtered through POV, with coins functioning as micro-setting that dictates tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens driven by protagonist agency in coin-flipping and distilling noise, narrowing options to surrender; cost is felt in the shame shed and the "corridor of usable silence," foreclosing doubt with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust in uncertainty emerges through concrete actions (flipping coins, distilling static) and the final non-literal answer that "understanding static bursts as prayer" reweights prior material without moralizing; subtext operates in images like "the prophecy braided us."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person plural POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose; elision of causality taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping, and diction remains consistent under pressure, e.g., "the static softened, as if the dead stars were pleased."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language like "the deck ripened into amber" is purposeful and clear; sentence rhythm accelerates with flips and settles at closure, maintaining propulsion without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of backwards prophecy and divination in a post-universe setting feels inevitable; risk-taking with accumulative structure and poetic diction heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific details like "coins rang like compact planets."</comment>
