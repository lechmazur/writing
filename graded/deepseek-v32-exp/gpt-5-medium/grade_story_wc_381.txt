<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices like placing the origami wing revealing hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete, e.g., "eyes bright with inward constellations," and the final renunciation of erasure in favor of release is earned by prior causality. However, the character leans slightly archetypal, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in "the future exhaled and tried again." Orientation is anchored early, and the pattern of silence mapping pays off. The drive lens holds consistently, with the brook's grammar shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice, e.g., the brook's flow dictates the summoner's actions and charges the final image. Sensory details like "sleeping stars" and "velvet riverbed" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The nocturnal haven functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing the prophecy) is signaled early and escalates through the summoner's agency under the accumulative lens, e.g., tracing patterns on water. Cost is legible in the code untying "like wet shoelaces," foreclosing the iron noon. One meaningful tightening occurs, though pressure is more textual than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the origami wing and brook, offering a non-literal answer to silence vs. noise. Subtext operates in gestures, e.g., the fox's tail "punctuating the slow grammar of water." No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete images and the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature evident in phrases like "ticked like paper thunder." Rhythmic control under pressure is consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., "listening until sound remembered mercy") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats, e.g., "terrestrially cosmic shimmer," slightly muddles clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence to hush a prophecy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details like the origami wing and fox transform tropes through grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
