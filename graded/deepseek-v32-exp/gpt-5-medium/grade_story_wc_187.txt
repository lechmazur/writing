<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene; final choice to speak personally is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the integration moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator's step into the forecourt reweights identity and collective memory with felt cost, anchored early and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the observatory and forecourt actively shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under accumulative lens, with the narrator's decision to speak personally tightening stakes and legible cost in the shadow measurement and integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity versus collective memory emerges through particulars and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; purposeful elision and dense phrasing are taught and pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold, and figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, even in peak beats like the final realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory and identity feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is organically integrated.</comment>
