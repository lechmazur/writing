<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courier's jitteriness and desire for stillness create compelling interior contradiction; the final choice to hold the pitch during the shared moment is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the ephemeral nature of the miracle and the courier's loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the courier's solitude and the transient overlap; orientation is clear early, and the absent mentor's constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and dragonfly-wing pendant constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to pressure the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the courier's agency in tuning to the widow and ridgeway, leading to a shared experience that deepens emotional stakes; cost is unmistakable in the corridor's thinning and the courier's pricking neck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory, grief, and continuity emerge through particulars like the yew seeds and pendant; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic diction remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats like the germination scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes courier trade with mystical elements in a non-obvious way; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
