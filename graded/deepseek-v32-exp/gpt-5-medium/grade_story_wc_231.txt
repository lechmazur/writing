<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as aligning the Edelweiss to the notch. Motivation is clear and consistent, driving higher-stakes choices like sending the light signal, with earned endurance and visible cost in the folded ledger page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens, with the light signal and reply charging the final image with cost legible in the keeper's role as witness. The lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist function as micro-setting that constrains choice, such as the notch guiding the investigation, and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the keeper's POV, with no generic placeholder elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the accumulative lens, from finding the notch to sending the light signal, with cost legible in the swept dock and folded page. The dominant stake of decoding the gesture tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and borrowed memories emerges through events and images, not statement, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the light reply. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, lyrical voice, and controlled diction under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off, such as the gaps observation method shaping the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with clarity and propulsion in peak beats, such as the description of the dock and the light signal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper, Edelweiss, and borrowed memories is non-obvious and organic, with risk-taking in lyric mode heightening stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel earned through character choice and specificity, not derivative templates.</comment>
