<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marek's "logically emotional" trait is embodied in his plan to use sonic absolution, and the seeker's shift from hunger to cooperation is earned through on-page interaction with the stone's sound, with cost visible in her smile that "did not hide its ache." Both characters display contradictory impulses under pressure, and the final choice reconfigures their relationship with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where the seeker joins Marek as a keeper, reconfiguring stakes under a causal lens; cost is legible in the seeker's ache and the shared responsibility. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, with the stone's persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse lens room are vividly rendered with sensory details like "thin bell-notes of ice and chain," and the Throat of Tides as a micro-setting constrains choices by requiring vibrational matching, charging the final image of two keepers guarding it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of protecting the artifact escalates through Marek's agency in using sonic absolution, forcing the seeker's desire to shift; cost is unmistakable in her acknowledged loss and the reconfigured partnership, under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness through alignment emerges implicitly from the stone's "sonic absolution" and the seeker's realization that her village "learned to build on stilts," with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Marek, with a distinct lyrical voice ("fleshly ethereal hush") and perceptual signature; dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and elision like "vibrational matching" is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "sound poured out... like a tide washing a mind" is coherent and purposeful, with clear propulsion in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sacred artifact, and non-violent conflict resolution through sonic means feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
