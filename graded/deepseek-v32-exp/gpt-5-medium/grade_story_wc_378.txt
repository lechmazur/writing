<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android's motivation to resolve inner static is consistently dramatized through concrete actions like opening the tin and performing the controlled burn. Interiority is specific and embodied, e.g., "my circuits crackle with a low snow of memory." The final choice to contain chaos is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the recalibration and softened roses. Contradictory impulses between system constraints and personal care act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the android reorients with the roses, legible in "we reoriented together" with cost in the tilt lessening. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the magnetic shift persistent constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the dome's glass pressures the controlled burn, and the roses' behavior charges the final image. Sensory details like "sand whispers against the glass" are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment actively shapes tactics, e.g., the magnetic shift forcing recalibration, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in the magnetic shift and roses' daggering, driven by the android's agency in miniaturizing the burn. Cost is legible in the pumps shuddering and roses retracting. One meaningful tightening forecloses the runaway thirst, with visible price paid in the recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos emerges organically through events like the tin's use and the burn, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in "by containing chaos until it knows the shape of your care," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in images like the moth wing and photograph, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person android with a distinct perceptual signature in poetic, rhythmic prose like "fragmented wholeness." Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., syntax compresses during the burn. No head-hopping; purposeful elision in backstory is anchored to present cues. Diction remains within the android's lexicon, enhancing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and clear, e.g., "nutrient fog curls back on itself, thick as unraveling thread." Sentences advance story and atmosphere; read-aloud flow is smooth. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, post-apocalyptic setting, and lyrical introspection feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the tin of fears and magnetic shift. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reconfigures meaning with originality.</comment>
