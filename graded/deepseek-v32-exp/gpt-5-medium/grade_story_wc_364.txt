<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iven's characterization is consistent and deeply embodied, with his quiet determination driving key choices under pressure. His motivation to coax resilience from rubble is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes bargain with the stone. The final act of offering memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his bruised wrist. Minor lack of internal contradiction keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight causal chain under the Causal lens, with Iven's three-night plan escalating logically to a decisive change. Closure lands on-page with the arches settling and rubble reshaping, cost legible in Iven's sacrificed memories and bruised wrist. Orientation is clear early, and the silk's constraint persistently shapes tactics. No flaws in structure or causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the orchard planet and floating arches constraining choices like using mine shafts as arteries. Sensory details (e.g., silk glowing "like water sliced thin") are filtered through the collective POV, enhancing atmosphere. The environment actively pressures tactics and charges the final image with the bells ringing in "azure defiance."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes around rebuilding the town escalate under the Causal lens through Iven's agency, culminating in the storm climax where his bargain narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in his offered memories and physical strain, altering tactics as the community lifts walls. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully with each night's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and bartered awakenings emerges organically from events and images, not statement, with subtext in the silk's properties and Iven's vows. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the planet answering "awake and deliberate," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars like the bells and roots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, rhythmic voice that modulates under pressure (e.g., "the wind grew spare, as though out of arguments"). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is cohesive, and elision (e.g., the conjurer's backstory) is taught and paid off in closure. Diction remains within the collective's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; lines like "the rubble sighed into shapes" are clear and purposeful. Read-aloud flow is smooth, with strategic telling compressing time without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (post-apocalyptic recovery) with fresh, non-obvious elements like bartering awakenings with stone, grounded in specific world logic. Risk-taking in lyric style and collective POV heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative patterns.</comment>
