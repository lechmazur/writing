<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions like the geode crystal's throb. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final vow to remain awake is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost, scaled to the length. Minor hairline slip in occasional abstract phrasing, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the protagonist feels the lift from unused potential. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is legible in the vow to remain awake and the bleak exhilaration. Persistent constraint of the geode crystal shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (circuit breakers cooling, green sky). The floating observatory and geode crystal constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, with drifting movements and valley views integrated into action. POV bias filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hunting unused potential escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency (perturbing currents). Cost is legible in the bleak exhilaration and the vow, foreclosing options. One meaningful tightening occurs as the basin appears and coordinates are sent, driven by character choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unused potential and honesty emerges through events and images like the geode crystal and drifting observatory, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the wounded hymn and lift, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic prose that reflects the narrator's mindset. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., perturbation theory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "intangibly tangible compass") causes slight muddle, but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion advances story consistently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (drone strike survivor, geode crystal, perturbation theory) feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, non-obvious angle on trauma and potential transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
