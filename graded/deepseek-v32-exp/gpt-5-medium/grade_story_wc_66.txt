<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (copying silence while seeking sound). Final choice to promise carrying tempo forward is earned by prior causality with visible cost in ongoing duty. Micro-choices under pressure, like tuning the radio and responding to Cinder, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost in the narrator's reconfigured role as conductor. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). Cost is legible in the final image of sleeping but keeping time, and persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (ember alcove, mist) pressures choices and charges the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The alcove and radio constrain actions, and the environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency (listening, responding, promising), with cost legible in the commitment to carry tempo. Dominant stake (teaching dust to tell stories) tightens through the pirate broadcast and interaction with Cinder, foreclosing options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images (silence, storytelling, memory) without direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the conductor listening. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and rhythmic, modulating under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., patterned imagery) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within narrator's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and closure image is sharp with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise synthesizes elements uniquely (pirate broadcast scoring fog, dust telling stories); risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details feel inevitable in hindsight, and transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
