<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "I learned to listen through ink, but I learned to believe only when the lamp drew breath for me." Final choice to continue writing is earned with visible cost in the silence and waiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds throughout; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the town's silence and the stationer's patience, evident in "Then my pages will be only paper, and the bonsai will keep the rest." Orientation established early with who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image; the bonsai labyrinth and stone basin shape tactics, as in "I press a page against the ice, gilding its edge with cold; the bonsai answer with very small winds." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation through density increase in the act of writing invented histories; stakes in providing meaning through silence are legible, with cost in the stationer's endurance. Agency in refracting light and writing drives pressure, though subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images, such as invented histories as a "workable grammar for waiting"; subtext in the tension between silence and story. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, as in "Texture is not touch alone; it is contour, bruise, breath, and the quiver of nearly vanished sound." No head-hopping or register issues; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and precise with high information density; no loops or scaffold issues. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is coherent, e.g., "the lamps in town will wake again someday, and their hum will find mine, a duet slowly rehearsed."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, with a non-obvious synthesis of stationer, bonsai, and invented histories; risk-taking in accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight, such as the integration of "incandescent restraint."</comment>
