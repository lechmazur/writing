<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coachman and Wren are vividly characterized with concrete interiority and embodied emotions; micro-choices under pressure, like stitching the map, reveal motivated hierarchy of values. However, Wren's backstory feels slightly summarized, and the coachman's emotional progression lacks a contradictory impulse in peak beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the crossing reweights the promise with felt cost in the final image of hills "breathing." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the single-scene structure tightens cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing constrains choices and charges the closure, with selective sensory details (e.g., "ferry rope sang a burr") filtered through POV; environment actively pressures tactics, such as the current turning the ferry, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering the promise) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase in stitching and crossing; agency drives tightening, with cost legible in the coachman's remembered sorrows and the map's transformation. Minor deduction for passive resistance from current rather than active antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of erasure and return emerge through concrete actions like stitching the map, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing; subtext in Wren's dialogue ("braid it") and the palimpsest image resists tidy resolution, lending complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; poetic diction ("mist braided the dawn") remains consistent under pressure, and dialogue carries subtext without register drift. Elision in reflection is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "water slapped the hull like a dog"), and sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the crossing. No loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (coachman, ferry) through specific imagery like the yarn needle and palimpsest promise; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
