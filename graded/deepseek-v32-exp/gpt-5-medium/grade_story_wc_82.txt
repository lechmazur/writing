<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like polishing stones and folding cranes. The final renunciation (ache loosening) is earned by prior causality, but interiority occasionally slips into abstract summary, such as "luminous torment wrapped in patient hands," which slightly reduces concrete specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens—the shadow's touch reconfigures the ache with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the staircase motif and dream recording pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating island and glass basilica constraining choices (e.g., stairs that deepen the air). Sensory details like "chime like small bells" and "tastes of cellars" are filtered through POV, charging the final image where rainbows seed his lungs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the lantern maker's agency in polishing and folding cranes, tightening the stake of grief reunion. Cost is legible when the shadow's touch loosens the ache, foreclosing a path with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformation emerges through particulars like origami cranes and gem polishing, with subtext in images like "fold grief into origami cranes." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as the messages transform "into change."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic rhythm and consistent POV. Elision (e.g., shadow detachment backstory) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Figurative language like "catches sky like a spoon catches sugar" is coherent and purposeful, though minor register elevation in "luminous torment" slightly risks clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes unique elements (floating island, dream recording) with emotional specificity, transforming grief tropes through craft. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
