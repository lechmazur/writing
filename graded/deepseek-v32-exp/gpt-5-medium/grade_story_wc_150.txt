<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like "a hinge give way in my chest." Motivation to restore faith intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices such as rebuilding the sundial and deciding to stay. Relationship with Sami acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter the protagonist's stance. Final renunciation of leaving is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) where the protagonist decides to tend the orchard, foreclosing return with felt cost. Inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural, held throughout with pattern shifts and density increase. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the emotional shift and the image of "dew jeweled the sundial base."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, as the catacomb orchard pressures tactics (e.g., roots braiding skulls) and the sundial base shapes closure. Sensory details are vivid and selective, like "tree roots snake between bones" and "wind that smelled of leaves and turned pages." Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening in rebuilding the sundial and deciding to stay. Cost is legible in the emotional resolution and the act of tending the orchard. Pressure coheres and grows, narrowing options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and faith emerges organically from events and images, such as the sundial and bones, without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the protagonist's realization that faith was "only interrupted." Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like the shadow kissing "the numeral for home."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is first-person stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, filtering setting through the protagonist's bias. Dialogue with Sami is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "starlings circled like punctuation." Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the sundial's restoration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of diaspora returnee, catacomb orchard, and sundial, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure effect is legible.</comment>
