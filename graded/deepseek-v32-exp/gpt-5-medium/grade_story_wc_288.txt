<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistently drives choices, such as using the sundial to stabilize the library. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., walking slowly to prevent floorboards from turning liquid. The final action of writing "shelter" into the catalog is earned by prior struggles, demonstrating credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through lyrical patterns to a resonant reconfiguration in the earned stasis of shelter. Closure lands on-page with cost legible in the library's exhale and the baskets' relief. Orientation is clear early, and the stone circle's hum persistently shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integral, with the tidal library and cloudlight constraining choices, such as the floorboards threatening to liquefy. The sundial and stone circle function as micro-settings that charge the final image of shelter. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "damp constellations drip across my wrists."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of independence versus isolation escalate under accumulative lens through increased density, like the storm and faltering hum. Protagonist agency drives tightening, e.g., angling the sundial and using the herd song to steady the library. Cost is legible in the relief and stabilization after the crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as "translating weather into shelter" without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the baskets dimming with relief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation through coexistence, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, e.g., "I keep hours that move like shorebirds." Perceptual signature is character-specific, filtering details through a poetic lens. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story and atmosphere without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "the cloudlight slides like water through letters." Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative build, with clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of magical realism and existential themes, with specific details like the tidal library and extinct species. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth arises from grounded particulars, avoiding cliché.</comment>
