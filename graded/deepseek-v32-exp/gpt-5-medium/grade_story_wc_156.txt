<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of perfect restoration is earned through prior causality, with cost felt in the admission that erasure fears living hands. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as using the nickel as both tool and oracle, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the mural's continuous questioning reweights options with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image of "a lighter step" and "map keeps unfolding." The pause motif tightens meaning without causality breaks, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, as the sound wave garden's parabolas dictate the restoration method through echoes. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, with the garden and hobo nickel charging the final image. The environment pressures tactics, such as using reflected sound to bewitch pigments, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exchanging certainty for curiosity escalates under accumulative lens through nested awakenings driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the loosening of certainty and the mural's persistent questioning. Agency in tapping the nickel and asking questions narrows options, with visible price in the foreclosed path of perfect restoration, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with subtext in echoes and pauses offering a resonant, non-literal answer to curiosity vs. certainty. The final image of the unfolding map reweights prior material without moralizing, and epiphanies are earned through concrete experiences like the mason's daughter's awakening. Satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic rhythm and methodical playfulness under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., the wall's voice) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping, and diction remains character-bound, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax, with rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; lines advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud test passes smoothly, and closure image remains clear, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes sound-based restoration and nested awakenings with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specific details like the hobo nickel's star carry durable insight. Transforms tropes through grounded choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
