<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in loss and the desire to mend. Micro-choices under pressure, such as dunking his head and fitting the charm, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance and "sharpened hope" are earned by prior causality with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the engine's revelation reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored early with the workshop and acid sea. Cost is legible in the acceptance of Mira's pattern and the protagonist's continued work. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the acid sea and workshop constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "hiss" and "drip" reflect urgency and POV bias. The key ring charm and statue function as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjuring meaning) escalates through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, such as measuring pockmarks and fitting the charm. Cost is felt in the realization of Mira's absence and the "sharpened hope." One meaningful tightening occurs when the engine speaks, foreclosing easy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from kintsugi and memory, with subtext in gestures like soldering "tiny rivers of gold." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the pattern of choosing, avoiding moralizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, such as the cracked moon charm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic syntax and rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "the workshop forgets to sink." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the alchemist's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language like "rusted with green fumes" is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the engine's activation. Clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, grief, and kintsugi feels inevitable, with specific details like the memory engine and acid sea. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through lived detail and emotional specificity.</comment>
