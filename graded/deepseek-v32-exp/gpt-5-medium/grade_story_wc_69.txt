<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as her shift from shouting to teaching. Relationships with students serve as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their state, and the final renunciation of past methods carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final silence and passing of the rosette, with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and emotional density. Orientation is clear early, and the rosette acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail, filtered through Mara's POV. The zither rosette functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, influencing key beats like the moment between Rafi and Ola.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with stakes in braiding harmony deepening through rehearsal to performance. Cost is legible in the unclenching room and shared sky, narrowing options and forcing trade-offs without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through subtracting noise emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final silence and rosette passing, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Poetic diction and syntax reflect Mara's mindset, and any elision (e.g., past causes) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with figurative language consistent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold issues; clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats like the performance scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of choir teaching with specific, grounded details like the zither rosette. The poetic risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation of tropes feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
