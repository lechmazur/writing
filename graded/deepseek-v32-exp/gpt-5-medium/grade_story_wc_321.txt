<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, e.g., "I felt the ferry steady under me, the way breath steadies after grief learns its rhythm." Internal conflict shown when disobeying the captain to listen to the radio, and final choice to keep the tide is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the final image of the ferry steadying and arrivals not vanishing. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction, with the tide as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the spectral grotto and hourglass constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "grotto scraped our masts with constellations" are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of losing arrivals is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens through density increase in the grotto scene, driven by protagonist's agency in using patterns and hourglass. Cost is legible in the choice to keep the tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs. permanence emerges naturally through events and images, not direct statement; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the final reconfiguration without moralizing, e.g., "promises mean little without their undertow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and rhythmic control under pressure heightens clarity without head-hopping. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density with varied rhythm and no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats like the grotto scene, without muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality lies in fresh synthesis of surreal elements with emotional truth, transforming tropes of time and transience through specific particulars; risk-taking in lyric style pays off with coherence and inevitability at closure.</comment>
