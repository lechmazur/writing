<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ossa's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority conveyed through embodied perception (e.g., "felt the soft bruise of its weight"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as testing stories and hiding the stamp, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (hiding the stamp) is earned by prior causality, though contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the stillness clings and the stamp is hidden, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns of discovery leading to the conceptual repricing ("lowered, not lost"). Orientation is clear early, and causality remains intact without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (silt, crabs clicking) filtered through POV. The sunken library constrains choices (blackout enabling stillness) and charges the final image. Micro-setting elements like the stamp drawer and journals alter tactics and deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing honest origins) escalates through agency-driven discoveries (e.g., stamping the bill, revealing redactions). Under the accumulative lens, density increases with each revelation, narrowing options and legible cost in the city's "tilt" and hidden stamp. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (stamp, journals, blackout) without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "lowered, not lost" as alternative hypothesis). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of truth and manipulation, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pages dry like leaves"). Voice is lyrical and consistent, with purposeful compression and rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in closure. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "stone lung schooling itself to breathe less"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity and propulsion are maintained through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis (sunken library, logical indexer, ink stamp) transformed through specific details. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The non-obvious angle on truth-seeking feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
