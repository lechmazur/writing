<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a crisis survivor turned historian of small gestures is clear and rooted in embodied contradiction ("benevolently ruthless"). Micro-choices under pressure, such as steadying shaking elbows while cutting apologies, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final shrugging off of the victim role is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate, and the accumulative drive lens holds through patterned walking and echoes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the narrator plans to leave with the nomadic penumbra. Closure lands with cost in the "legible silence" and the chessboard's abandonment, shaped by the persistent constraint of the gallery's echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering gallery constrains choice through its echoing properties, forcing the walking method, and key objects like the chessboard and lantern charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's bias, with the "luminous absence" and marble rim creating a cohesive atmosphere that pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving small gestures) are signaled early and escalate under the accumulative lens through agency-driven spelling of words like "water" and "stay," deepening the cost of memory and resistance. The tightening is visible in the echoes' reweighting of options, with felt cost in the participants' shared actions and the narrator's final renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like spelling "water" with embodied memories, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "nomadic penumbra" image, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the shared loop for "er" in "water."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct poetic voice and rhythmic control ("the air glowed with a luminous absence"). Perception is character-specific, and purposeful elision (e.g., patterned walking) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "nomadic penumbra," with clear propulsion. No artifacts obscure causality; the final image is sharp, and rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar crisis tropes with fresh specificity through the whispering gallery and walking method, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and emotional truth arises from particular gestures like the widow's button.</comment>
