<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority embodied in specific details like "ink-stained and awake" and the daylily rasping the knuckle. Micro-choices under pressure, such as opening the telegram and collaborating with Mara, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice to keep witnessing is earned by prior causality, and the relationship with Mara acts as a crucible, altering emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where shared decoding reweights meaning, with cost legible in "healing travels fastest by ordinary words." Inferred hybrid lens (accumulative/textural with causal elements) holds throughout, driven by the telegram's arrival and collaborative work. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with no teleporting props or outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the observatory's tools enabling the decoding method. The daylily-pressed telegram and variable stars charge the final image, with sensory details selective and purposeful (e.g., "red lamps," "stars brightened and faded"). Environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding inscriptions and healing through words) escalates under the hybrid lens via protagonist agency, from personal fear to shared burden-sharing. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional weight carried and released during the reading. One meaningful tightening occurs when conversation is identified as essential to decoding, narrowing options and deepening knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens and healing through words emerges organically from events and images, such as the mirror-story and vocal collaboration, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "healing travels fastest by ordinary words," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, like Mara pressing her palms flat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, rhythmic prose that modulates under pressure (e.g., "syllables falling like water"). Dialogue, though brief, is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (e.g., dream sequences) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors (e.g., "light into grammar"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the decoding scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through a fresh synthesis of lucid dream chronicling, variable stars, and temple decoding, transformed via specific grounded choices in character and stakes. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens meaning without gimmickry, and turns feel earned in hindsight, such as the realization that decoding requires conversation. The core concept of shared burdens is indispensable to closure.</comment>
