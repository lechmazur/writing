<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The shift from underachieving mage to caretaker is earned through the climb and interaction with the light, with visible cost in the final image of the "hush" on hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist's role changes. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the "hush" and reputation shift. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (e.g., mist walking for broken steps) and charges the final image (light and keystone). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the transformation and sharing of the "hush." Dominant stake (authenticity vs. automation) tightens meaningfully through the climb and keystone use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the light's behavior. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the protagonist's shift, avoiding moralizing. Epiphanies are earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping. Elision (e.g., mist walking) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats. Minor overwriting doesn't harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic and automation tropes through specific choices. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
