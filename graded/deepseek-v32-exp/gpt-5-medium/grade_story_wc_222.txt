<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (trembling hands) and micro-choices under pressure (swapping pieces). Final choice to mend is earned, though internal contradiction could be more pronounced in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (trembling certainty, sky fixed), and Accumulative lens holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the chessboard constraint shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (blue lamps, chessboard of ice and ash) pressure choices and charge the final image. The spire and recurring objects are indispensable to the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency in swapping pieces, tightening stakes toward fixing the weather. Cost is legible in trembling and time ticking audibly, though one swap feels slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mending and wonder emerges organically from actions and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. No moralizing; subtext operates in swaps and promises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue at end is natural and goal-driven, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, varying rhythm, and no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm clarity, but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is a fresh synthesis of thief and weather-mending tropes, transformed through specific details and risk-taking in style. Closure feels inevitable and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
