<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory (e.g., "reluctant performer" yet theatrical), with micro-choices under pressure (tuning instruments, speaking to night) that align with motives. Final choice to write an entry is earned by prior causality and Anya's notes, with visible cost in "inheriting a promise." No stock phrasing or diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through descriptive layers to closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the diary opens and protagonist writes, reconfiguring empathy with cost legible in "throat tightens" and "inheriting a promise." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting ("shadowed workshop under stars") is vivid and sensory, filtered through POV. Micro-setting (copper bowl, diary) constrains choice in tuning and charges the final image. No generic details; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering silence and empathy) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increase (tuning, diary entries). Agency drives escalation, with cost legible in emotional weight and promise. No coincidence; one meaningful tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy through listening emerges from particulars (diary entries, protagonist's actions). Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer in "teaches a heart how to approach without conquest," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in silence and resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (poetic, introspective). Voice ("theatrical sincerity") is consistent and modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., diary contents) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "tone that coils like smoke"). No register drift or artifacts in peak beats; closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes pacifism, empathy, and technical detail in a non-obvious way. Emotional specificity avoids templates; turns feel earned. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
