<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to graft onto community is clear and drives the story, with embodied emotion like "luminescent ache." Micro-choices under pressure, such as answering Farrin's chalk with a reed twist, reveal values. Final grafting is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost legible in the ache that "glowed like a lantern for many hands." Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of kinship and shared search. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from search to posture discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the crystalline orchard and crater constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "stardust sugar" and "mineral sigh" are filtered through POV, integrating into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting onto community escalates through protagonist-led search, involving others and leading to the leaning posture. Cost is felt in the transformed ache, and agency under accumulative lens drives meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of togetherness emerges organically from events and images, such as the repeatable curve and leaning posture, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "webs of kinship" and "luminescent ache." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and perceptual signature is consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor potential overwriting in figurative language does not obscure clarity or closure, and no loops or scaffold artifacts are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical setting and community building feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details like the crystalline orchard and posture transformation avoid tropes, offering fresh insight.</comment>
