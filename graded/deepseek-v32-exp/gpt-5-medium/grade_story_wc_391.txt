<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (impatience vs. patience) acting in scene. The final choice to teach patience is earned through prior mapping and interactions, with visible cost in the community's transformation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, such as unyoking urgency and walking softly purposeful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration ("our patient revolution stood") as an earned stasis, legible cost in the community's shift. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with orientation anchored early. The magnetic viaduct and mapping methods create a coherent pattern that pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, e.g., the frozen lake dictates work cycles, the magnetic viaduct after rain alters tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The basalt sanctuary functions as a micro-setting that supplies heat and patience, affecting outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, from personal mapping to teaching the girl and village men. Cost is unmistakable in the community's grumbling shift to purposeful work. Dominant stake (patience vs. impatience) tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as "sculpt patience from impatience," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the revolution standing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, e.g., the girl untying a knot, deepening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, observant, and rhythmic. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "restrained wildness" in prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal, as with the girl's question. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "breath plumes like banners." Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats like the viaduct walk.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the non-obvious synthesis of patience as revolution, transformed through specific details like horizon mapping and magnetic viaduct. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, with authentic vision.</comment>
