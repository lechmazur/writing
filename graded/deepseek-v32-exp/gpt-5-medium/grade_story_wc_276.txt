<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in traits; interiority is embodied ("patience in my mouth"). The final choice to return the map is earned by prior causality with visible cost, but internal conflict could be more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost (coast losing itself). Orientation is clear early, and the rail spike constraint shapes the final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the sound wave garden constraining choices (e.g., walking aisles) and charging the final image. Micro-setting (rail spike) actively alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (restoring coast) signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency (voicing silence, walking path). Cost is legible when the coast devours silence, and a meaningful tightening occurs with the goddess's demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening and holding vs. opening emerges through events and images; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in actions like returning the map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; poetic prose reflects the focalizer's mind. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "syllables that had no letters") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, but minor overwriting ("Sound became brine, brine became wind") causes slight figurative muddle without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
