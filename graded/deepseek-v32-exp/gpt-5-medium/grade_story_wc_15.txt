<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity and the town's plight. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as sewing the tether and using the plate, reveal embodied emotion and interiority. The final renunciation of the plate and carrying the tether home is earned with visible cost, foreclosing a path through prior causality. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies detract from her characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, building through imagery and patterns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "hidden sluices open" and the town's astonished reverence. Orientation is clear early, and the labyrinth's constraint shapes tactics. The closure unit lands on-page with a felt cost of transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with sensory details like "rust and thyme" and "sunbaked kelp" filtered through Sera's POV. The labyrinth environment constrains choices, such as following sleepwalking paths, and charges the final image with its breathing presence. Micro-settings like the plate and tether alter tactics and closure. No generic or static description; all details serve narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming ruin to reverence escalates through Sera's agency under the Accumulative lens, with meaningful tightening in beats like sewing names and using the plate. Cost is legible in the opening of sluices and the town's change. Protagonist-driven escalation reweights stakes without coincidence. One minor hairline slip in smoothness, but pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as "ruin can be taught to sing," without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the labyrinth breathing. No moralizing or thematic echo; complexity arises from particulars. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that filters details through Sera's worldview. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in lines like "a lullaby of small persistence and shy thunder." No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherence supports closure. Elision is taught and paid off in the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is voice-motivated and clear, e.g., "nets hang like gray rain." Minor overwriting in one phrase ("shy thunder") but no coherence loss or artifacts harming closure. Read-aloud test passes with propulsion and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of wharf weaver, labyrinth, and forbidden plate feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details like sewing as ceremony. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid derivative premises; closure recharges prior material.</comment>
