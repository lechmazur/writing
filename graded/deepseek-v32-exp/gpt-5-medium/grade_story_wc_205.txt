<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to use the shard in the council is earned by prior causality, and the relationship with Ledger serves as a crucible. However, minor poetic abstraction in peak beats slightly limits concrete contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with conceptual repricing as the archive revision reweights the civilization's meaning, with felt cost in "my revolution remained defunct." The hybrid drive lens holds, and persistent constraints (shard, mirrors) shape tactics. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight from inciting incident to climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, and the baroque asteroid environment pressures choices. The shard and mirrors function as micro-settings that constrain actions and charge the final image. POV filtering is consistent, and tone supports theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpretation of the past) escalates under the hybrid lens through protagonist agency, from finding the shard to public readings and council performance. Cost is legible in the protagonist's endured futility and the revised archive. Coincidence is absent, and pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of ornament as solidarity emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures like covering mirrors. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shard's translation, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct poetic voice and perceptual signature. Dialogue with Ledger is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and purposeful elision (e.g., time-squalls) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor overwriting in dense passages doesn't harm clarity. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes visible time, archaeological dispute, and poetic rebellion with non-obvious ingenuity. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
