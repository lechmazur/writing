<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with the surveyor's stoically sensitive trait driving micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is clear and intensifies through the narrative, culminating in an earned endurance that forecloses paths with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and avoids stock phrasing, exemplified in lines like "boots remembering former thresholds." The final choice to map gaps rather than repair the past is credible and rooted in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot structure under an accumulative/textural lens builds cohesively to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure, with cost legible in the wait for witness "without shame." Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The closure unit is on-page and reweights prior material through the final image of the city breathing "through its missing teeth," making the cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, as the submerged pavilion pressures the surveyor's actions and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, such as the "damp that smells like letters never sent." The environment actively shapes tactics, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering options and deepening thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through the protagonist's agency in placing notes and wrestling with doors, tightening the narrative toward a cost-laden closure. The dominant stake of witnessing abandoned dreams is signaled early and deepens via density increases, such as mapping "vanished laughter." Cost is unmistakable in the surveyor's endurance and the final act of leaving a note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the inkwell and notes, offering a resonant, non-literal exploration of memory and absence without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery and implication, as in "hushed blaze" representing restraint as flame. The ending reweights prior material by loving gaps "until they answer," avoiding tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice exhibits a distinct perceptual signature with poetic diction and rhythmic control under pressure, stable in first-person POV. Elision is taught and paid off, as in the early "drawbridge rises" cueing the timeframe. The narrative stance remains consistent, with syntax reflecting the surveyor's methodical yet sensitive mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, such as "memory were bioluminescent," enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the closure image is undulled by artifacts, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in the fresh synthesis of a surveyor documenting submerged memories, with specific details making the premise inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure and lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept transforms familiar tropes through grounded execution and emotional specificity.</comment>
