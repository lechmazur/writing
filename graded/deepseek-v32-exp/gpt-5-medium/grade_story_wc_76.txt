<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; internal conflict is embodied in choices like the final renunciation, which is earned by prior causality with visible cost when he chooses the keeper over his desire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with decisive change and felt cost as he foregoes stepping beyond fate; causal lens holds strong from arrival to choice; orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of the hunger stone shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral, with the lighthouse and hunger stone constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt and secrets" are purposeful and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency with the yoyo and stone, leading to a legible cost in the threaded visions; dominant stake of fate versus moral choice tightens meaningfully under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fate and cost emerges through events and images like the yoyo and stone, not statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer in the choice of "unbroken tide" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic and consistent, with elision like "wind spoke under the steps" taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent even in peak beats, such as "radiance sharpened to a blade of fog," advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts like counter-clockwise clock maker and hunger stone feels inevitable; risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and closure is charged with specificity.</comment>
