<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as using jealousy to sharpen perception. The final choice to pack the scroll and patrol demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost, foreclosing paths without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the scroll and grave reweighting meaning and cost legible in "balancing the ledger of weather and footfall." The structure is non-linear but taught early and pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated with sensory details like "snow rasped the windows" and "logbook smelled like wet wool," constraining choices and charging the final image. The cabin and ridge function as micro-settings that pressure the narrator's actions and reflect internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the dream sequence and tracing of the scroll tightening the stake in narrative coherence. Cost is unmistakable in the acceptance of chronological confusion and the packed scroll altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the birch bark scroll and soaring dream, offering a non-literal answer to time and memory without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, as in "let the narrative soar somewhere just ahead."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, evident in phrases like "dreams know my name because I autograph them for a living." Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful elision and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, as in "stones stacked like unsent letters," and propulsion is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, chronological confusion, and feral nostalgia feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in structure heightening stakes. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail and non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
