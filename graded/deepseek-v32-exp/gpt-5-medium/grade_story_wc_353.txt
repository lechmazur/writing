<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied actions; interiority is concrete with micro-choices under pressure, such as adjusting from symphony to pulse. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the grove's sigh and shared weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the "sigh that rustles only inward." Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image; the porcelain insulator and alder grove pressure actions with vivid sensory detail. Specificity is purposeful, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, shifting from symphony to pulse with cost in the grove's release. Stakes deepen meaningfully, though the turn is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and action, such as "art is a vessel for bearing those remembrances safely," without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tree-song sculptor and empathy in motion feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors universals.</comment>
