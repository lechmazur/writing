<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The artisan's characterization is deeply embodied through her unique perception methods, with micro-choices under pressure, such as patching the circuit and adapting to fog, earning the final resolution. Her blindness constrains actions authentically, and motivation is clear, though internal conflict is minimal but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages; closure is a decisive change (successful coupling) with cost legible in the fog-induced tension. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of blindness shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as fog scrambling landmarks forcing drone guidance by tone, and water bowls functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the artisan's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, with the fog complication requiring adaptive tactics like adding bowls and patching code, and cost is felt in the momentary silence before recovery. Dominant stake (successful coupling) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception and technology emerges organically through images like water refraction and drone guidance, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final smile and settled wheels. Subtext operates in gestures and implication without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects the artisan's worldview; rhythmic control under pressure is evident, and any elision (e.g., fog effects) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and lyrical rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peaks like "depot watches with windows," but clarity remains. Sentence propulsion supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of blindness, technology, and natural elements feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical compression heightening stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like water bowls and drone use transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
