<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to strip drama is clear and consistent, rooted in her researcher traits. Interiority is concrete through actions like sweeping and tracing spirals, showing embodied emotion. The final shift to observing gradual change is earned by prior causality, with cost in accepting unspectacular symmetry. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a conceptual repricing in the final notebook entry. Cost is legible in the acceptance of gradual change and patient fractures. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of dust and decay tightens meaningfully. Persistent constraint of time and damage shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting pressures choices through silt, broken panes, and compost, constraining actions like sweeping and pinning plastic. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, e.g., "algae slicked the tiles." Environment charges the final image with the plastic sheet and dust map. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal conflict between dramatic models and gradual observation, escalating through Mara's agency in sweeping, tracing, and adopting a new discipline. Cost is legible in her renunciation of theatrics for patience. Under accumulative lens, density increases with dust patterns and star comparisons. No coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges from particulars like butterfly dust and pulsar timings, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final rehearsal metaphor. Subtext operates in images and silence, e.g., "the star coming to terms with friction." Earned through concrete experience without moralizing. Complexity embraces honesty over spectacle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature blending scientific and reflective tones. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "kindled humility" cohering through turns. Dialogue with neighbors is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, advancing story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, e.g., "time like paper," without muddle. Sentences propel accumulative pattern; no artifacts obscure closure. Read-aloud test passes with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neutron star research and greenhouse recovery feels inevitable, with specific details like butterfly dust topography. Tropes transformed through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in blending domains heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in the calibration of gentleness.</comment>
