<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, driving her actions under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions and micro-choices, such as thwarting the cutpurse, revealing her steadfast nature. The final choice to capture the sound is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the broken trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkages, leading to a decisive closure where trust breaks, felt cost in the smuggler's recoil. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the hush shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "lantern light" and "salt and rot," integrating with action to pressure choices. The pirate market and hush constrain Lark's moves and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing trust breaking escalates through Lark's agency via false starts, narrowing options. Cost is legible when Kettle and the smuggler fracture, driven by protagonist choices. Escalation under causal lens is coherent and meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust and sound emerges through events and images, not statement, with subtext in gestures like Kettle's eyes. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, poetic yet controlled voice under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. Elision is purposeful, taught early, and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise with high information density, vivid imagery, and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion supports scene needs without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is original—capturing sounds of human weather—synthesized with specific details and character-driven choices. Tropes are transformed through grounded execution, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
