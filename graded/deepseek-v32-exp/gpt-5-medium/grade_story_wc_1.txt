<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling to read frost) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to fuse the ledger is earned by prior causality, foreclosing paths with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as adaptive resilience versus lingering trauma, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image of the ledger fused into a window, reweighting truth under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The rival's laugh unspooling from stone demonstrates a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (canyon, frost) constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through POV bias (e.g., "frost bloomed from the shadow"). Micro-setting elements like the ledger and glass rod alter tactics, avoiding generic description. Spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from finding the ledger to identifying the rival, with cost legible in the decision to fuse it. Dominant stake (uncovering truth) tightens through meaningful turns, foreclosing options without coincidence. Pressure coheres until the final act reweights cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges through particulars like frost patterns and ledger gaps, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image (e.g., "absence turned into guidance"). Emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding abstraction or tidy resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "Song nested in stone, then rose"). Purposeful elision (e.g., ledger's cryptic entries) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven (e.g., "a tiny drought of soot"), enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and no artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry, forensic frost reading, and moral calculus feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, and the final reconfiguration is earned.</comment>
