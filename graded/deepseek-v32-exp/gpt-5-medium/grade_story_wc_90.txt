<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's steadfast pacifism and gravitational trait drive motivations with embodied emotion; micro-choices under pressure, such as balancing joy and grief to operate the lock, reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to tend rather than conquer is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the emotional journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the door opens to a library of seeds, reweighting options with cost legible in the protagonist's balanced weight and promise. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of emotional balance pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (recycled spaceship) and objects (kwan yin's tear, photographs) constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, e.g., "salt veins glowed" for navigation. Micro-setting as the lock mechanism pressures tactics, and spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (opening the locked dimension) escalates through protagonist's agency in emotional balance under accumulative lens; cost is visible in the calibrated buoyancy and the commitment to tend. One meaningful tightening occurs as the lock responds to weight, narrowing options with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of compassion, shadow work, and renewal emerge through particulars like the tear and library without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the image of seeds and words. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., "compassion without its shadow is brittle."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is poetic yet consistent, e.g., "joy rise again, loosening my boots." Purposeful compression in emotional beats enhances pressure without head-hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, e.g., "I promised, with ghostly resolve," and diction remains within POV's lexicon, avoiding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional gravity with sci-fi elements feels inevitable; risk-taking in metaphorical structure (e.g., gravitational lightness) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in details like "kwan yin's tear" transforms familiar concepts through grounded choices.</comment>
