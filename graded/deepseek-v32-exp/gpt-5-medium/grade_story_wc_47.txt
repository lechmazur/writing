<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied with concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure; the narrator's "watchful dreamer" trait and motivation to "graft new meaning" drive credible endurance, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost in the burial scene. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as the tension between offering the pendant and the unspoken history, avoiding stock phrasing. The relationship with "her" forces choices that alter their state, fulfilling the crucible test. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the burial and agreement "not forgiveness, exactly," under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the pendant and setting persistently constrain tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the final image reweighting prior material. The cost is legible in "we practice being two again," and the structure follows Track A defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image; the "abandoned data center turned moss garden" pressures the burial action and mirrors internal states through sensory details like "moss gossiping in a green undertone." Sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, with selective, purposeful detail integrated into action. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves causally, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening from proffering the pendant to the burial, narrowing options with cost legible in "chain we leave exposed." Dominant stake of emotional resolution is signaled early and deepens through density increase. The resolution is earned by alteration and renunciation, with no coincidence; moral calculus sharpens the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from events and images, such as the pendant burial reweighting "damage is gentle," without direct statement; subtext operates in gesture and silence, like "we do not hug; we inventory." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "practice being two again," avoiding moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is concrete through particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature with poetic, controlled rhythm under pressure; POV is stable first-person with purposeful compression, and dialogue carries subtext and goals, as in "You kept it, she says, not a question." Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon, and psychic distance shifts intentionally. No head-hopping or register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts; figurative language like "honeyed hush" is consistent and purpose-driven, enhancing clarity. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs, and syntax supports emphasis. No scaffolding, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in a fresh synthesis of reconciliation tropes through specific setting and emotional complexity; the core premise is transformed via grounded choices like the icicle pattern and pendant burial. Turns feel earned in hindsight, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with authenticity of vision.</comment>
