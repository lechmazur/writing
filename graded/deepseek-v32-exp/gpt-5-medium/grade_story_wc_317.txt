<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to safeguard innovation is clear and consistent, driving her micro-choices like planting the seed and drafting rules. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as feeling her "nerves sink" beside the seed, avoiding stock phrasing. The final decision to create the new experience is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in "profit would trickle, but meaning would flow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing under an accumulative/textural lens, with Mara's commitment to stewardship reconfiguring meaning amid external pressures. Cost is legible in her rehearsal of the pitch and acknowledgment of trickling profit. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the final image of the seed "sleeping like an unsent letter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like "damp planks" and "moonlight braid with current," selectively filtering through Mara's POV. The brook and annex pressure choices by fostering receptivity and innovation, while the corpse flower seed as a recurring object charges the final image by symbolizing patience and decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of innovation vs. external pressures escalates under the accumulative lens through Mara's agency, as the seed arrival deepens her resolve. Cost is unmistakable in her trade-off between "trickle" profit and flowing meaning, and her plans to confront the landlord show tightened options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship vs. spectacle emerges organically through events like the seed's arrival and Mara's reflections, without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the "brook kept her secret," and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "possibility kept watch like a patient lantern."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, reflected in poetic, reflective prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythmic control is evident in lines like "the river ticked its patient syllables," and purposeful compression, such as "storm-born silence," is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "owls stitched the silence," and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes escape rooms and corpse flower seed with originality, feeling inevitable through grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in quiet, reflective style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
