<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to preserve lost songs and reinvent history after betrayal is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "I trust him because his bow keeps no secrets." Final choice to trust is earned through micro-choices like mapping dust and sending pigeons, with visible cost in vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with closure as Charged Poise: "I feel a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut" reconfigures trust with felt cost. Orientation is clear early; causality coheres through patterns of dust, music, and trust, with persistent constraint of past betrayal shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choices: dust motes guide pigeon routes, attic clearance forces action, and meteorite chip calibrates doubt. Sensory details like "dust sweet" and "bruised tulip" are purposeful and charged in the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust escalates through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: attic clearance forces decisive action to send song, with cost in risk of betrayal. Escalation is driven by mapping dust and choosing to trust, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of trust and preservation emerges through particulars like trading music scraps and reinventing history; subtext operates in gestures and silence. Ending offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, e.g., "Trust returns across learning to trust again."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: poetic, character-specific voice like "pigeons preen like small hearths." Rhythm and diction control under pressure, with no head-hopping; elision (e.g., dust mapping) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, e.g., "blooming withering, a bruised tulip folding and opening." No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, advancing story without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon training, meteorite chip, and dust mapping feels inevitable; tropes are transformed through specific details like trust built via music. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with fresh inflection in closure.</comment>
