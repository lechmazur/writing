<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gardener's interior contradiction (blithe yet shadowed) is embodied in micro-choices like untangling knots with kindness, and his final respect is earned by prior causality with visible cost when his "blithe mask soften[s] into respect."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from clock wait to decoding; closure is a decisive change (discovering truth and planting poppies) with felt cost in the gardener's softened mask and the silo's "echoes charted now by mercy."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry constrain choices (e.g., echoes guide discovery) and charge the final image; sensory details like "velvet unwinding" are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by gardener's agency under causal lens (waiting, decoding, finding grave); cost is legible when his palm is "nicked by a burr of wire" and he understands the "lie," tightening stakes to a irreversible revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth and intention emerges through particulars (tapestry knots, empty grave) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in the poppy ring that "honors both the living and the departure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "velveteen gloom"); rhythmic control under pressure, as in "uncharted echoes drift down like migrating birds," and purposeful elision (e.g., tapestry's grammar) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied syntax without loops or scaffold; figurative language like "choir that never finished learning the hymn" is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements (gardener, silo, decoding threads) feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure reconfigures prior material with emotional specificity.</comment>
