<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trait ("quietly deliberate"); interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "I whispered the rune for return." Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, but lacks deep internal contradiction, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in "the line slipped under my skin like a lucid ribbon." Orientation anchors early; structure is single scene with coherent pattern escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective ("night winds that tasted of iron"); observatory and mirrors constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding shadows) escalate under Accumulative lens via density increase in ritual; agency drives tightening, with cost in signing the rune. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (loops, loss) without moralizing; ending offers resonant, non-literal answer: "shadows wait inside decisions." Subtext operates through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled under pressure. Elision (e.g., "spoons bend reality") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety; no major loops or artifacts. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "like a patient lung") but voice-motivated and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers fresh synthesis of shadows, memory, and loops; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
