<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure driving the plot; Mara's shift from skepticism to belief is earned through dramatized events, and contradictory impulses are shown in scene with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost (Mara's trembling breath and naming); accumulative/textural lens holds, with orientation clear early; the quartz arbor and prism constrain tactics and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the quartz arbor and car window constraining choices and amplifying stakes; sensory details are selective and filtered through POV, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) escalates through narrator's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in Mara's emotional shift and relief, foreclosing her doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic and controlled, dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and clear, even in peak beats, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and emotionally specific, transforming tropes through grounded details; risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
