<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to "unbind the silence" is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion in lines like "ears are acoustically perceptive." Micro-choices under pressure, such as playing music and deciding to tend to unfinished things, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, some interiority edges toward abstraction in peak beats, slightly reducing concrete particularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as characters decide to "visit the halves and almosts," with cost legible in "the hush loosens one more braid." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and mosaic structure with shards (memories, present) is taught early and pays off. Minor ambiguity in causal linkages between shards prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, e.g., "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" constrains choices by shaping the gathering space. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as "roots drinking brackish light." The greenhouse and bowl recur to charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in playing music and gathering stories, deepening the stake of finding beauty in the unfinished. Cost is legible in "the hush loosens one more braid." However, pressure coheres but lacks a sharp tightening that forecloses a live option, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, e.g., "an unfinished song keeps walking with you," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to central questions. Subtext operates in objects like the mendicant's bowl, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement, but minor reliance on lyrical abstraction slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "trained by breakwater murmurs." Dialogue with Lark is natural and goal-driven, advancing theme. Rhythmic control is evident in sentences like "the orchard settles, and the hush loosens one more braid." No head-hopping, but occasional dense syntax in reflective moments slightly reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "barnacles hold their breath." Read-aloud test passes, and closure image is sharp. Minor over-density in some metaphors prevents a higher score, but no artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with music and storytelling feels inevitable, e.g., the "chronic hush" braiding with notes. Specific details like the "mendicant's bowl" avoid template plots. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure transforms prior material.</comment>
