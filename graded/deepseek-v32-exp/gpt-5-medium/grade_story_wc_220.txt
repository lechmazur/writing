<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., trading for phonograph, experimenting with leaf). Harbor's backstory and actions enrich motivation, but internal conflict lacks deep contradictory impulses, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (communication redefining distance) and felt cost in the quiet aftermath. Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with persistent constraints (distance, scrap) shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices (e.g., wasteland dictates relay location). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, with the scrapyard and leaf charging the final image. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens (trading, experimenting, activating relay). Cost is legible in the emotional weight and reconfiguration of distance. Stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of distance and scars emerges through particulars (leaf, relay) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image and realization. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and poetic rhythm. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., riddle) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful (e.g., "gust sounded like a door learning to breathe"). Clarity and propulsion are maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (phonograph cylinders, leaf compass) transform familiar tropes.</comment>
