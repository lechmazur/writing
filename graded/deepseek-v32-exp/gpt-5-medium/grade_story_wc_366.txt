<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., building five stones for love) revealing a hierarchy of values. Motivation to protect safety is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices like writing "We are still here." Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as sleeping in the lantern room despite claiming preference for the bunk, and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Charged Poise in the final image of stones and sea glass reconfiguring safety. Cost is legible in "the luminescent ache that guards a coastline." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of letters and stones is taught and paid off, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "fog swirled like breath" filtered through POV. The haunted lantern room and sea glass constrain choices and charge the final image, altering tactics during the storm. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details integrate into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safety and connection escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist agency (lighting candle, writing letters, building stones). Cost is unmistakable in "ache that shines enough to guide," narrowing options and deepening stakes. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "If safety could be bottled...," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle, and complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, e.g., "the room above me remembered every shipwreck." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven in pieces, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "luminescent ache," without muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms the lighthouse keeper trope through specific details like the anonymous letter chain and stone messages. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the combination feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth and authenticity.</comment>
