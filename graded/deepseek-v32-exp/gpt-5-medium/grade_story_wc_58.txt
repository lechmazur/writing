<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in unique traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as "my breath is threaded with salt and brass." The woman's grief is vividly portrayed through archival eyes and whispered names, driving micro-choices under pressure. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; final renunciation is earned with visible cost in weeping as irrigation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the woman's weeping and shoulders learning "a slope that a future can rest on." Orientation is clear by ~120 words with harbor, garden, and traveler role. No causality breaks; the thread's use and projection method cohere to charge the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: the shadowed garden with quince trees and cracked fountain pressures the intimate interaction. Sensory details are purposeful, like "leaves like small coins spending their shine," filtering through POV. The garden charges the final image with "spangled with the stubborn brilliance of leaving things," integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional healing through explained absence) escalates under accumulative lens via density increase in the thread's use and projective presence. Agency is clear in the protagonist's method and the woman's request; cost is legible in her weeping as "irrigating." One meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price, though slight abstraction in "geography of healing" limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence and healing emerges organically through images and events, like the thread humming "mapping the distances grief must traverse." Subtext operates in gestures and silences, e.g., "knees almost touching, an intimate geometry." No moralizing; final image reweights prior material without stated thesis, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "grief has seasonality, and the season is always now." Voice is poetic yet controlled, syntax varying with emotional pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in projective presence scene is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, e.g., "leaves like small coins spending their shine into the hush." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths create natural momentum; clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is uniquely synthesized: obituaries for the living and projective presence offer a fresh angle on grief. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the palace thread and intimate geometry. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable and coherent.</comment>
