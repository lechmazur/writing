<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion (e.g., "every metaphor felt like a cracked teacup"). Final choice to call the foreman is earned by prior causality and regret, with visible cost in the "imperfect miracle."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final nocturne and call. Hybrid drive lens holds, with causal linkages (device setup leads to communication and action) and accumulative texture. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (archive, orchard) and objects (perfume bottle, metronome) constrain choices and charge the final image (peach drawing prompts the call). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Hybrid lens: from apology attempt to communication to saving the orchard. Cost is legible in the exposed column and "imperfect miracle." Dominant stake (reconnection) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles and forgiveness emerges through events and images (e.g., "broken metronomes" analogy), not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Dialogue via stylus carries subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., ghost communication) is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats (e.g., "forgiveness is a coastal town"). Clarity and propulsion maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (gossip-column exorcist) offers a fresh synthesis, with specific details (perfume bottle device) that feel organic. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable.</comment>
