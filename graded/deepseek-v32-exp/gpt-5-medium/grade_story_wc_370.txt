<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions like "enlarged tranquility" and shame micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of old shapes is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the refusal to reconcile. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, such as the urge to flee versus staying to learn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "books rarely return to uncreased spines." Causal lens holds tightly from invitation to library encounter, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of past mistake shapes tactics and final image, making cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the library's warm lamps and paired books pressure the confrontation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, like "afternoon dust floated like waiting thoughts." Micro-setting (the notebook) reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, from accepting the invitation to reading aloud with the man. Cost is legible in the stacked motives and steady understanding. Dominant stake of unearthing wisdom tightens meaningfully through dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars like the nestled paradoxes and paired books, not statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the city's "mercy" image. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "attention my lantern." Voice modulates under pressure with lyrical control. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the man's "voice did not accuse."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, e.g., "dust floated like waiting thoughts." No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of nestled paradoxes feels inevitable, transforming the mistake trope through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
