<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motives are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (stepping aside) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the girl's unescorted crossing. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as burning bridges yet collecting ash as proof.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible when the girl crosses without looking back. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The fading threshold brightens decisively, reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges the final image—the door and doorknocker ring are tactile tools that shape tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with the sanctuary's hush and sky mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful tightening as the teacher-student dynamic deepens. Cost is unmistakable when the girl breathes without apology and crosses alone, foreclosing the protagonist's solitude with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like burning bridges and linking scars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to stewardship and release. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as the shadows' refusal to let the protagonist vanish, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—poetic, rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the door's fading) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "ash as proof that leaving can be an act of stewardship," without muddle in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the non-obvious synthesis of burning bridges as stewardship and scars as translation. Risk-taking in symbolic narrative heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Specific details like the doorknocker ring are irreplaceable.</comment>
