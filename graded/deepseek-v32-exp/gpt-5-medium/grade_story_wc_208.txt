<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied interiority (e.g., "reverent kind of hunger"). Final choice to build the gate is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the labor and transformation. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though contradictory impulses are subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the gate's creation. Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern taught early. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and persistent constraints (storm, archway) shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV (e.g., "rain like threaded needles"). The storm-tossed archway constrains choices and charges the final image, while driftwood and lantern function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining passage) escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency in building the gate. Cost is legible in the effort and storm confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the slide's light guides construction, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, such as the gate symbolizing passage. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the concept of "timewoven alliances." Subtext operates in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is poetic and consistent, with purposeful compression (e.g., "layered meanings click like mortises"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "storm stitch me to the archway's shadow"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept of "timewoven alliances" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and specificity anchors universals through particular details like the lantern slide and driftwood.</comment>
