<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sorin's internal conflict is embodied and drives micro-choices, such as the hands feeling like "tools for theft," earning the shift from scripting to following. However, minor abstraction in epiphanies slightly reduces concrete immediacy, but closure choice is motivated and cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the protagonist learns to follow, cost legible in "meteor hush made of listening." Accumulative lens holds, with events building ethically; orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Decommissioned radar dome constrains choices through acoustics and charges the final image with "meteor hush." Sensory details like "footsteps into chalk marks" are selective and purposeful, integrated with POV bias and atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, from argument to inviting the woman, narrowing options ethically. Cost is legible in the reversal of methods and the hush replacing applause, though one minor dip in middle momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges through particulars like the story stick and puppet shows, not statement; ending offers resonant non-literal answer with "listening" reweighting prior theft. Subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person plural "we" is stable as single POV, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical prose like "half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke." No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "smoke that forgot its fire") causes minor muddle. No loops or artifacts harm closure; rhythm supports accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ethical storytelling with puppet shows and story stick feels inevitable; risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details like "subversive puppet shows" avoid template plots.</comment>
