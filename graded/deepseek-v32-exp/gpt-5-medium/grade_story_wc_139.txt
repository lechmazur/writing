<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in contrast with father's deceit; internal conflict shown through embodied emotions under pressure, such as Arman's trembling eyelids met with steady hand. Micro-choices, like not lying but not naming him dead, reveal a hierarchy of values. Final choice earns fairness through causality, with cost in risk taken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the "new vowel of fairness," reconfiguring the father's legacy. Causal lens holds tightly from setup to execution, with orientation anchored early. The breach action and escape sequence are because/therefore linked, and the ink pot's recurrence charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices: prep room smells and tools pressure tactics, while the ink pot as micro-setting charges closure. Sensory details like "citrus, ethanol" are purposeful and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography during escape is coherent and alters options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of asylum and fairness escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens, from waiting actively to executing the breach. Cost is legible in the risk of capture and emotional weight. One meaningful tightening occurs at shift change, narrowing options and forcing the escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of fairness emerges organically from images like the ink pot and "mathematics of a fair trade," without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "new vowel of fairness," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the hand on Arman's shoulder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled rhythm under pressure, e.g., "waiting actively is like polishing a mirror." POV is stable first-person, and perceptual signature is consistent. Elision in reflective fragments is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in phrases like "deathly vitality held too long in the mouth" does not harm closure. No loops or artifacts; propulsion is strong through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes funeral home realism with political asylum in a fresh, non-obvious way. Mathematical metaphors feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and transformation of the con-artist trope is specific.</comment>
