<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal conflict is concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to "choose the river" is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the market path with visible cost. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; contradictions act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist internalizes emblems, reconfiguring options. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; cost is legible in the final image of "pockets bright with offerings." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, e.g., the "river within the river" thread guides the protagonist's wading. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The feral nexus acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency through cameo appearances, deepening the stake of artistic integrity. Cost is legible in the trade-off between "market ladder" and "river footsteps." One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist wades in, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of collecting hopes emerges through particulars like the shell and cameos, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the final image of writing "as they wanted to live." No moralizing; subtext operates in gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, e.g., "lucidly watchful" bias. Lyrical prose is consistent and voice-motivated, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "shell throbbing like a pocketed star." Sentences advance story and atmosphere without redundancy or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of writer's inspiration tropes through specific, grounded choices in the feral nexus and ephemeral cameos. Risk-taking in lyrical design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
