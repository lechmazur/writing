<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to repair the gear is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost when he sees "where I would translocate during sleep and why the waking always hurt." Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as not wanting to repair but doing so for freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the image of "time in the tree unraveled its snag" and the realization that "each night a different grove found me so I could learn a different grammar." Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern density increase, and orientation is clear early with "mechanical rainforest" and "stray philosopher."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the mechanical rainforest constraining choices (e.g., the gear in the root) and charging the final image of the "tree stitched from axles." Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, such as "river of mercury beads" and "bark stamped with serials," reflecting POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal understanding escalates under Accumulative lens through the hum shifting "from counsel to ache," leading to the protagonist's agency in repairing the gear. Cost is legible when he sees the cost of translocation, and escalation is driven by his choices, narrowing options with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the gear as "pupil become teacher," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to self-discovery without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, like "ruin teaches what perfection hides," and the ending reweights prior material through the realization of "interior distance."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in phrases like "grammar of polished brass" and "wind through different trees." Rhythmic control under pressure is maintained, and any elision (e.g., translocation mechanics) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No major artifacts or loops; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though minor density in peak beats prevents a higher score. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through a specific synthesis of mechanical and natural elements, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through grounded detail, such as the gear's evolution from object to key.</comment>
